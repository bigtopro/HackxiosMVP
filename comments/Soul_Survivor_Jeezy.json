We gotta get through this shit no matter what. All my life I been wanting to rap. I used to freestyle with my homies in my ram on 20s. Subs under the seats all that shit. Man. I miss them days. Stay strong kings and queens. We don’t got time for hate and discrimination. Shit my best friend is black.  I support that man so much. We changed my fuel filter and both got sprayed with gas in the eyes from that shit. And I told that man “Jay throw some water in Your eyes”. I care a lot about folks. Ima lil white boy. But aye. I got a big ass heart. Cuz fr. I’d fuck a racist ass person up. Period. We all Americans bruh. Don’t hate. We all dealing with the same shit. Especially now. ( and I’m almost 30 years old).  I support anybody that’s doing their best. We’re humans. We’re based on flaws and failing. But that shit makes us stronger. For real. Nipsey hussle.  E-40. Lil Wayne. Dr Dre. Eminem. 2Pac. busta rhymes. Tech N9ne.  All them folks know wassup. Life’s a bitch man. But we gotta be there for each other. We all we got. Cuz I know damn well the government doesn’t give a fuck about us. I’m prolly one of the least hateful white people to exist. So don’t hate on me cuz I care.

  "It\u0027s not so much about the complexity of the rhyme, but more on how it relates to the person who listens. Sometimes you have to take lyrics as reminiscing points in somebody life and feel what they saying more than just listening. The 95 Air Max \u0026 Hot Cheetos line is not about being intricate. it\u0027s to create a line between THEN and NOW. Allowing the listener to take notice of things that we don\u0027t think about until told. As they say. \"the Simple things in life\" and besides the violence and poverty. Having Hot Cheetos and 95 Air Max was the little slice of life when your in the hood when you thought even for that small moment... Everything\u0027s going to be alright.",

The beat is the life. The flow on the track is perfect but the content is typical, predictable, and common. What businesses are you running? Try and interview your people find out what they are up to. Is rap really this \"simple now\". There is no valuable content. I realize I can\u0027t use any of it. I jam to the beat and even some of the lyrics but the content is garbage and it not uplifting at the end of the day. I wanted to cover the song for my apparel I want to support and spread the song further but not with this truth. I\u0027ve seen this truth already.
