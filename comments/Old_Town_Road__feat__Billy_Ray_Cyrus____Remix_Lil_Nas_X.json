  "Вы бы знали какой он сейчас. Так, рассказываю как я начала его не любить. В 4/5 лет мой брат слушал эту песню (Old Town Road), и эта песня мне очень понравилась! После этого, я частенько просила брата, что бы он включал эту песню.  Потом, я знала песни MONTERO, и разные другие.  Тогда, когда он был уже ге_м.  Я не знала конечно же что это означает, и хотела их тоже слушать. Я также просила его включить и эти песни, и он их включал, но ему было будто все равно, будто он тоже не знал что это, хотя ему уже было 12/13 лет.  Наверное, вы знаете эти клипы, и видели что там.  Но я продолжала слушать. Я подросла, мне было 11, и уже в этом раннем возрасте я узнала что это такое. Посмотрела клипы опять, чтобы по ностальгировать, но увидела эти сцены и моменты.  После этого, я больше не любила его. Но песню Old Town Road я обожала, и даже сейчас я просто не могу с нее.  Знаю весь текст, немного ошибаюсь, но, эта песня очень крутая.  Остальные альбомы и другие песни, для меня самые самые фушные.  Извините, если вам они нравятся, это чисто МОЕ мнение.",

I’m not ready for the 2030s, ain’t no way 2020 will be 6 years ago, I remember when 2014 was 6 years ago and we all saw how fast 6 turned to 10 years now. How is 2016 going to be 10 years ago next year, it was just 4 years ago??!! I started elementary school in September 2015, take me back! I hate high school so much. 2010 - 2019 was so peak. Mainly 2012 - 2016, then 2014 - 2017. I miss Summer 2012 - Summer 2018. Take me back please, I hate 2025, this year sucks so much. Take me to a place that I once knew that was filled with happiness and thrill and everything was possible. I went through so much these past 2 years since 2020. I\u0027m only 15 and I remember all of these, I started elementary school in September 2015 and graduated in June 2020, lol. That virtual graduation was so miserable, but these memories are coming back, my favorite school years would have to be 2015 - 2016 (Kindergarten), 2016 - 2017 (First Grade), and 2017 - 2018 (Second Grade), mainly because all of my teachers gave me best memories of my life/childhood and most of my friend group started from here. I seriously wish I could go back, I remember when the Fidget Spinner trend was popping out in 2016 and 2017 the teachers got annoyed with us about it, but we didn\u0027t care. I remember the \"DAB\" back when everyone was doing it and it was a whole thing during 2017, I remember in Kindergarten we had a \"Kindergarten Zoo\" basically it was us picking animals that we wanted to do and create a diorama of the animal and their habitat. After we watched Madagascar (chosen by me since it\u0027s one of my favorite movie franchises). I remember when Despacito came out, me and my friends entered a talent show and performed. I can\u0027t believe that was June 2017 and June 2018, I miss those days and I pray for those days to come back once more. I can\u0027t believe this song is almost 6 years old and considered a throwback, this was so big in 2019 and had everyone on a chokehold.",

  "A child is born weak in every way. Above all, he needs the affection he receives from his parents or caregivers. They are his role models, and he learns many of their habits. Over time, these habits become instinctive and are stored in memory, but he may also acquire wrong habits, such as favoritism towards siblings or other wrong habits. Religion may also be a wrong habit. A child\u0027s mind is not yet fully developed, so how can he choose a religion and learn about God at an early age? For example, reproduction in nature and science is natural. It is very likely that a child will come and worship strange things. For example, if I change my religion, leave my family, travel to a faraway country, get married, and have a child, my child will come and worship my new religion. What a wrong principle in choosing a religion! This is the greatest evidence that God created us with the heart and mind to know God when we grow up. I have a suggestion for you: Food and drink contain happy hormones. Fast for ten full days. Abstain from food and drink until sunset.  Go to your temple and repeat, fast for another ten days, go to the mosque and pray with the congregation. Read in your own language, and that\u0027s fine. Where does peace and tranquility come from when you are in direct communion with God? Life is short. How long will you live? More than a hundred years, and then you will die. Only your work will benefit you. Everyone will abandon you. If you like it, follow my posts and share the post so that everyone can benefit.",

  "Aqui vai um resumo bem organizado sobre os temas que você pediu, com explicações claras: --- ### **1. Classificação das Ondas quanto à propagação no espaço:** - **Unidimensionais:** Propagam-se em uma única direção (ex: onda em uma corda esticada). - **Bidimensionais:** Propagam-se em um plano (ex: ondas na superfície da água). - **Tridimensionais:** Propagam-se em todas as direções (ex: som no ar). --- ### **2. Quanto à direção da vibração:** - **Ondas Longitudinais:** A vibração é **na mesma direção** da propagação (ex: som no ar). - **Ondas Transversais:** A vibração é **perpendicular** à direção de propagação (ex: corda vibrando). - **Ondas Mistas:** Possuem componentes longitudinais e transversais (ex: ondas no mar). --- ### **3. Quanto à natureza:** - **Ondas Mecânicas:** Precisam de um meio material para se propagar (ex: som, ondas em corda, água). - **Ondas Eletromagnéticas:** **Não precisam de meio material**, podem se propagar no vácuo (ex: luz, micro-ondas, raios X). --- ### **4. Cálculo do comprimento de onda e da velocidade:** - **Fórmulas principais:**   - **v \u003d λ · f**     - *v* \u003d velocidade da onda     - *λ* \u003d comprimento de onda     - *f* \u003d frequência da onda   - Se souber o tempo (*T*), use: **λ \u003d v · T** --- ### **5. Características do som:** - **Intensidade:** Relacionada à **força/volume** do som. Depende da amplitude. - **Altura:** Relacionada à **frequência**. Sons agudos têm alta frequência; graves, baixa. - **Timbre:** Permite distinguir dois sons de mesma altura e intensidade. Está ligado à forma da onda (harmônicos). --- Se quiser, posso montar um mapa mental com isso tudo. Quer?",

  "Muslim: Let me ask you something. Do you believe that everything has a cause and purpose? Seeker: Yes, I believe that. Muslim: Then, this vast universe, with its precise order, couldn\u0027t have come into existence by chance. It must have a Wise Creator. Seeker: Maybe, but how can you prove that Islam is the true religion among others? Muslim: Islam supports its message with rational and practical evidence. The greatest of these is the Quran itself. Did you know that the Quran contains scientific miracles confirmed by modern science? Seeker (curiously): Scientific miracles? Like what? Muslim: Let me share some clear examples: 1. Embryonic development: The Quran says: \"Then We created the drop into a clinging clot, and We created the clot into a lump, and We created the lump into bones, and We covered the bones with flesh.\" (Quran, 23:14) Modern embryology, discovered centuries later, confirms that the human embryo indeed develops in these exact stages. 2. Expansion of the universe: The Quran states: \"And the heaven, We constructed it with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander.\" (Quran, 51:47) Scientists, through the Big Bang theory and ongoing astronomical observations, now know that the universe is continuously expanding. 3. Mountains as stabilizers: The Quran describes mountains as \"pegs\": \"Have We not made the earth a resting place? And the mountains as pegs?\" (Quran, 78:6-7) Geology confirms that mountains have deep roots that stabilize the earth\u0027s crust. Seeker (impressed): That\u0027s fascinating! How could a book from the 7th century contain such advanced knowledge? Muslim: That\u0027s the point. The Quran is not just a book of guidance but a divine revelation from the Creator, containing knowledge that no human could have known at the time. Seeker: I see. Maybe it\u0027s time I read the Quran for myself. Muslim (smiling): Absolutely. Seek the truth with an open heart, and you\u0027ll find it.",

  "Idk how it would have worked out if they released his original version worldwide on radio, tv, the internet, \u0026 \u0027media\u0027 in general ; considering the beat is a combination of the primary Trent Reznar / NiN production \u0026 Kio\u0027s remixing it into a popish beat.  However, i still think he would have made a buttload more money than he ended up making. I am talking him making as much money off this single track as he eventually made off of his entire library combined. They likely never would have gifted him a career though if he tried that ! They had to get the rights to the Master of the track, which led to the remixing of the aong before it was truly pushed. They, of course, helped him settle all the legal liability in the process, HOWEVER: *THEY NEEDED TO REMIX TO OBTAIN THAT ALL IMPORTANT MASTER COPY, AND GIVE THE SLAVE THE SLAVE COPY.* [IT IS IN ALL ACTUALITY CALLED A SLAVE COPY... LIKE LEGITAMITELY !]",

  "am the longgest chat in \u003eI am going to do it. I have made up my mind. These are the first few words of the new... the best ... the Longest Text In The Entire History Of The Known Universe! This Has To Have Over 35,000 words the beat the current world record set by that person who made that flaming chicken handbooky thingy. I might just be saying random things the whole time I type in this so you might get confused a lot. I just discovered something terrible. autocorrect is on!! no!!! this has to be crazy, so I will have to break all the English language rules and the basic knowledge of the average human being. I am not an average human being, however I am special. no no no, not THAT kind of special ;). Why do people send that wink face! it always gives me nightmares! it can make a completely normal sentence creepy. imagine you are going to a friend’s house, so you text this: [ see you soon ] seems normal, right? But what is you add the word semi to that colon? (Is that right? or is it the other way around) what is you add a lorry to that briquettes? (Semi-truck to that coal-on) anyway, back to the point: [ see you soon ]THAT IS JUST SO CREEPY! is that really your friend, or is it a creepy stalker watching your every move? Or even worse, is it your friend who is a creepy stalker? maybe you thought it was your friend, but it was actually your fri end (let me explain: you are happily in McDonalds, getting fat while eating yummy food and some random dude walks up and blots out the sun (he looks like a regular here) you can’t see anything else than him, so you can’t try to avoid eye contact. he finishes eating his cheeseburger (more like horseburgher(I learned that word from the merchant of Venice(which is a good play(if you can understand it(I can cause I got a special book with all the words in readable English written on the side of the page(which is kinda funny because Shakespeare was supposed to be a good poet but no-one can understand him(and he’s racist in act 2 scene1 of the play too))))))) and sits down beside you , like you are old pals (you’ve never met him before but he looks like he could be in some weird cult) he clears his throat and asks you a very personal question. “can i have some French fries?” (I don’t know why there called French fries when I’ve never seen a French person eat fries! all they eat it is stuff like baguettes and crêpes and rats named ratty-two-ee which is a really fun game on the PlayStation 2) And you think {bubbly cloud thinking bubble} “Hahahahahhahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!! Hehheheheheh.....heeeheehe..hehe... sigh. I remember that i was just about to eat one of my fries when I noticed something mushy and moist and [insert gross color like green or brown] on the end of one of my fries! now I can give it to this NERD!! ” (yes he is a nerd because all he does all day is watch the extended editions of the hobbit, lord of the rings and star wars and eat fat cakes (what the heck is a fat cake? I think it might be like a Twinkie or something)and twinkies(wow so is doesn’t really matter which is which because he eats both(i may have just done that so I didn’t have to Google what a fat cake is (right now I am typing on my iPhone 3gs anyway, which has a broken antenna so i can’t get internet anyway (it’s actually a really funny story that i’ll tell you sometime)))and sit in his man cave with his friend named Joe (an ACTUAL friend, not a fri end)and all Joe does is watch sports like football with bob and all bob does is gamble ferociously (don’t ask(it means he buys all those bags of chips that say “win a free monkey or something if you find a banana in your bag*”(if there is a little star it means there is fine print so I always check the back of the package) *flips over the package* okay, it says: “one of our workers accidentally threw a banana in the packing machine and we don’t want to get sued so we did this promotion thing” cool. Oh wow, this is salt and vinegar! my favourite! i hate cheese and onion.))and that’s pretty much his life, he lives in Jamaica with Naruto and his friends) so you give him that gross fri end he throws up all over you and me and the worker behind the counter who was still making an onion, and THAT is the story of the fri end, not a friend who somehow remembered your name and your phone number / email so he could text you saying he would come to your house soon. *finally takes a breath after typing a few hundred words about fri-ends* so what now? i know, i know, you think i ramble too much and use too many brackets (i don’t) but now i am going to talk about my amAZEing day. first i woke up, ate choco pops for breakfast even tho i always hate it when people say that cause i get jealous and super hungry. then i... umm... yea! that was my day. you know that other person i mentioned before? that flaming chicken person? WELL. i will steal something from that person but do it better. i will... drum roll please ...",

  "Ok, if I’m being honest.. I’m not a fan of the song just because any country song is a skip for me, but now this song has became one of my favorite purely for the fact that since montero’s release every single homophobic redneck country bumkin and or religionous zealot that hated on all of your LGBTQ+ \u0026 allies music for being gay and refused to listen or worse let their kids listen to it fearing it would turn them gay has been listening to music by a gay man and enjoying it is just.. so gratifying it’s so refreshing and makes me so happy to see their world crumble as they realize the bs they caught themselves in and trying to “repent” by not listening to it anymore but knowing that it’s their favorite song makes me want to just look at them and say “well who’s rallying around the gays now!”",

  "So people from Lil Nas\u0027s highschool said he was straight as a toothpick and he was a player with girls.  But he always wanted to be rich and famous with the rap music he did.  Fast forward the secret societies aka illuminati and big record labels offer him a contract and fame and miney only if he played the role of being a gay rapper.   And if he breaks that rile it means  he gets \"suicided.\".  Just like they \"suicide\" the ithers who break the illuminati oath rules.  And also thats why he is all about satan because to become a puppet oc the illuminati like all celebrities are just peppets of the real illuminati bloodline families, it means you must denounce which ever god or faith that you follow and you must partake in their luciferian ceremonies.   They have \"whitewashed\" modern satanism.  But make no mistake the real luciferianism which is practiced by the illuminati it involves blood sacrifices and real satanic worship which also conaiata of pedophilia  Not all that glitters is gold....",

  "I\u0027m a musician I always recognize parts like songs being stolen from other people and you know you could always find like every rap song is using parts of Classic Rock songs or funk songs stuff from the 60s 70s 80s 90s but You Know the earliest rap they\u0027re using guitar parts and stuff from Classic rocks and stuff they\u0027re Up There trying to do what Stephen Tyler was doing back in the late 60s early 70s he was rapping before anybody else had the I do and I\u0027m  Not interrupt at all but I hear enough I live not too far from Chicago also it\u0027s popular  In this area more than probably any  Other. go down to Southern Illinois it is quite a bit different than up here North Illinois day and night difference..  So I\u0027ve heard all sorts of music including quite a bit rap you know I\u0027m not personally into it I like the song but I noticed right off that guitar parts the very first parts that start and it sounds like some kind of old guitar like it\u0027s coming off of an old like record player or something. that exact sound was being used by 9 inch nails at least one of their songs and it was pretty much the exact same note the exact same round the closer album round the song closer itself in the ending you can see and if you didn\u0027t steal this apart from that song then must be 1 hell of a coincidence what question is I never would imagine something like that could have been turned into like a cowboy\u0027s hot. LOL and I like him like this I don\u0027t like him when he\u0027s trying to dress up like a demon and have sex with. Satan or whatever he is doing in a movie awards he\u0027s not with that other f** it was also just like the double bunch of queer  Weirdo\u0027s. look I got a friend that\u0027s a gay You Know what he\u0027s gonna take it too far and even he doesn\u0027t like what\u0027s going on with these people PERIOD we are I would wager that this song\u0027s been stolen by Somebody I Don\u0027t Know WHY keep Here in nice nails. Yes too bad this dude you know changed I know you can\u0027t do Cowboys stuff and everything\u0027s gone but the whole new freaky satan is and things it\u0027s not for me I\u0027m not a church goer I was an atheist but you know what I want you some horrible supernatural experiences and I don\u0027t play with stuff like this or bands like ghost anymore it was funny when they were joking to be in comedia about it but then I got way too serious I\u0027m not into child sacrifice which is a must amongst the  Satanic  Devil worshipping community",

For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. -- 2 Timothy 3:1-2,4,13 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. -- 2 Corinthians 2:11  Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: -- Matthew 25:41 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. -- Romans 10:9-10",

  "I\u0027m currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don\u0027t think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it\u0027s great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I\u0027m struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor. The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42. I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you",

  "If you died tonight, do you know where you will end up? This is the most important question you will ever ask yourself. The way to find out is if you have obeyed God’s Law, The 10 Commandments. You Shall Not Take the Name of the Lord in Vain. Have you ever used God’s name in place of a bad word? You Shall Not Murder. God tells us if we get angry without cause or hate someone, we are guilty. You Shall Not Commit Adultery. Jesus tells us, whoever looks at anyone to lust after them has already committed adultery with them in their heart. Have you ever looked with lust? You Shall Not Steal. Have you ever taken something that did not belong to you no matter the value? You Shall Not Bear False Witness. Have you ever told a lie, even just one little “white lie?” We can violate God’s Law by attitude or intent. This is just half of The 10 Commandments. We know we will ALL be found guilty and since God is a righteous Judge, He will have to punish us for breaking His Law. That punishment is eternal conscious torment in a place called hell. But God loves us so much that He provided a way to be forgiven for breaking His Law. Jesus Christ lived the only perfect life ever and took our punishment for our sin when He died on the cross. All we have to do is turn from our sins and receive Jesus Christ into our heart and we will have eternal life. This is a FREE gift from God. Once we take our last breath, our eternity is sealed . . . forever.",

El mar se agita y sus olas rompen con furia y vigor y en su misterio encuentro la fuerza y el poder las conchas y los corales adornan su interior y en su creación veo la perfección del ser. El viento sopla fuerte, como un canto de amor y en su melodía encuentro la pasión y la emoción los árboles se mecen y se rinden a su humor y en su movimiento veo la vida y la expresión. La lluvia cae y su sonido es música celestial y en su frescura encuentro la renovación y la paz las flores se nutren de su agua tan natural y en su fragancia veo la belleza y la verdad. La noche llega y el cielo se cubre de estrellas y en su brillo encuentro la magia y el misterio la luna llena ilumina todo con su huella y en su luz veo la maravilla y el misterio. Así, en cada estrofa que escribo, en cada verso que riman busco expresar la belleza, la emoción y la verdad pues al final de todo, lo que cuenta es el amor en el corazón y en esa luz encuentro la felicidad, la plenitud y la eternidad.",

Your suffering or your luckp reflective of something in your past life and everybody looks at everything the wrong way. But insight I wish to provide for young black men. You failed me twice horribly and if you only knew the spiderweb of divine intervention that brought us together and how horrifically you failed for your race in resolving issues with the union. Violence simply because you’re absent minded and you think you’re powerful because you run jewels  Or because you get violent when you don’t get sex. These two sins need to be on the agenda of young black men to stop repeating because your tragedy mirrors your tragedy and you’re doing it together yourself",

  "It took me years to actually hear this tune and see the video, and now I wonder how any conservative in the US read this as affirming their notion of modern country western music. This is on the same level as cons getting mad over Rage Against the Machine once they realized that Rage was hard leftist/anarchist punk rock. Like, I have an excuse. I didn\u0027t know this artist until way later. But, how do you watch this as a white, FOX news style conservative, then point at your TV and say, \"Lookie here, Maybell! They got them one of those \u0027good ones\u0027 on!\"?? Like, how do you not get it? Song slaps though, and I wish it went on for another verse or two, because I dig it! I love satire, parody, and subtle digs at social norms and this one tickled me pink! I hope Lil Nas X goes on to have an even bigger, brighter future as an artist because, honestly we need more of this energy out there!👍😎👍",

John 3:16 Bible....THE RAINBOW🌈THRONE OF SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST AND THE TREE OF LIFE, Revelation 4 and Revelation 22 Bible. And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.🔥This is the second death. Revelations 20 bible.... ❤I SAW A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. 2 Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. 4 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.” 5 Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”❤ 6 And He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. 7 He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. 8 But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone,🔥which is the second death. BIBLE  REVELATION 21! ❤For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23) ............That if you confess with your mouth the Son of God Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.Romans 6:23) bible.....Fight for what is right now. 2023 2023 2023 Peace peace peace",
