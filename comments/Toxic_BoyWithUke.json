So, I decided to give this Dope Song as the Theme Song of Jeffy\u0027s Weakest Sunbather Frenemy, Mickey Mouse! Plus, Jeffy\u0027s real Theme Song is \"GIANT\" by Rag\u0027N\u0027Bone Man.",

  "Saw him tonight at an iconic venue in SF. Fuck this dude who doesn\u0027t seem to realize that it is his fans that put him on stage. He insulted the city, the venue, fans in the audience, including a 10 year old. At one point in the set he asked for gifts to be thrown on stage and then gleefully picking up a sweatshirt someone bought from merch and taking it backstage as he said \"that\u0027s an $80 mistake\" with a smile. He had the audacity to later announce that his favorite person on the tour is the person selling merch and sang some bullshit song that everyone should go buy his merch before walking off stage to a projection that literally said \"The End.\" On top of all this, the majority of his set used prerecorded vocals so he basically lip synced the whole thing. This would be bad, but coupled with his total disrespect, it was the worst show I\u0027ve ever seen in 15 years in SF. Skip this tour. I hope he never gets another based on what I saw tonight Venues and labels need to pay attention to artists that do this by canceling contracts and not bringing them back. Being on stage is a privilege. Fans and cities are their lifeblood.",

  "For whose didnt understand; The F-16 Fighting Falcon is one of the most effective multirole fighter jets used worldwide, designed for both air superiority and ground attack missions. Its design emphasizes lightness and aerodynamic efficiency. The airframe has a low drag coefficient, ensuring stability even at high speeds. The fly-by-wire system enables electronic balancing of the aircraft rather than manual control, significantly reducing the pilot\u0027s workload during high-maneuverability situations. This system also allows the aircraft to have a deliberately unstable structure, enabling quicker and more agile turns compared to traditional aircraft designs. At maximum speed, the F-16 can reach approximately Mach 2, twice the speed of sound. The aircraft can withstand up to 9G forces, delivering a turn rate of up to 25 degrees per second. This exceptional maneuverability provides pilots with a critical advantage, especially in close-range air combat (dogfights). The wing design is semi-delta shaped, offering low drag at high speeds and high lift at lower speeds. The wings are swept at a 40-degree angle, enhancing aerodynamic efficiency and enabling tighter turn radii. Additionally, the 11 underwing hardpoints allow the aircraft to carry a wide variety of weapons and munitions, making it versatile for different mission types. The F-16 is powered by either the Pratt \u0026 Whitney F100-PW-200 or the General Electric F110-GE-129 engines. These engines produce up to 129 kN of thrust with afterburner, allowing the aircraft to maintain performance even during vertical climbs. The vertical climb rate is approximately 254 meters per second, enabling rapid altitude gain in a short time. Advanced radar and avionics systems, such as the AN/APG-68 radar, enable effective detection and tracking of both air and ground targets. This radar system performs long-range scans, simplifying target acquisition and providing early warnings against enemy threats. In turning maneuvers, the angle of attack (AOA) is crucial. The F-16 is designed to maintain aerodynamic stability even during high-AOA maneuvers. Its maximum AOA is approximately 25 degrees, allowing the aircraft to generate high lift even at low speeds. This feature is particularly beneficial in close-range dogfights, giving the F-16 a distinct advantage over its opponents. The turn radius of the aircraft varies depending on speed and altitude but averages around 370 meters, allowing the pilot to evade enemy missiles or aircraft with tight maneuvers. Fuel capacity is another critical factor enhancing the F-16’s operational capabilities. The aircraft can carry approximately 3,175 liters of fuel in its internal tanks, with the option to increase this capacity using external fuel tanks. When equipped with external tanks, the F-16 can achieve a range of up to 4,220 km. Additionally, its air-to-air refueling capability allows it to undertake long-range missions without time constraints. The cockpit features a large bubble canopy that provides excellent visibility, improving the pilot\u0027s situational awareness. The modern HUD (Heads-Up Display) system projects critical flight information within the pilot’s line of sight, enabling them to stay focused on their mission even under high-speed and high-stress conditions. Another key aspect of F-16 operations is energy management, which relies on the relationship between speed and altitude. Pilots strategically manage their speed and altitude to preserve the aircraft’s kinetic and potential energy, allowing them to exploit advantages over their opponents during combat. This is particularly crucial during high-speed, high-maneuverability scenarios to prevent energy depletion. The aircraft typically operates at altitudes of up to 15,240 meters, granting it the ability to avoid enemy air defense systems or engage long-range targets effectively. In conclusion, the F-16 Fighting Falcon is a highly capable fighter jet, excelling in both close-range air combat and long-range missions. Its aerodynamic design, powerful engines, advanced avionics, and versatile weapon systems make it a formidable asset for air forces worldwide. Its maneuverability and resilience have established it as an indispensable choice in modern aerial warfare.",

  "when i got shifted to a new place in 2021, i already shy, introverted, naive, also it was already the time of  lockdown. i had a hard time talking to new people and perhaps no one wanted to talk to me because of my these traits in my new school . When i did start to open up a bit, i also gave feminine energy, perhaps because of an absent father. I was devastated when the only person that I considered as my good friend started to hate me and spread false rumours about me. This gave me trust issues and made me reluctant to consider anyone as my real friend. 3 years later: i\u0027m not shy and introverted, and i\u0027ve become less naive and  feminine than before. I\u0027ve become a lot  colder . I have some \"friends\" but no one to call my best friend Thanks for reading",

Tik tok no me deja subir la publicación al menos que tenga su permiso. No ganaré nada de dinero con la publicación y seguramente nadie lo veré o le prestará atención. Solo quiero subir el vídeo y tenerlo de recuerdo a futuro. Si en algún momento se realiza alguna donación a ese vídeo se lo pagaré de mi bolsillo. Que dudo que sean más de un par de centavos.

I try to bottle my emotions and just go on with my day but they keep getting worse every day. I\u0027ve been bottling my emotions for around 2 years, and I have to deal with this every day. I did not want to tell anyone because people in the internet taught me to laugh at fat people, so I guessed that people laughing at me was okay. But it wasn\u0027t. Please just be kind. I really am trying to feel better, and I know that people on the internet are mean, but I really need your help. Please tell me what to do",

  "Bài gốc:     • BoyWithUke - Toxic (Of...   Sẽ tốt hơn hết khi chỉ có tôi Lyrics: Một lũ bạn bè khốn nạn Chẳng tí tham vọng Thị phi và chúng nó luôn tiêu cực Mình cần bạn mới, chắc sẽ lâu chẳng dễ có được Ô hãy đưa tôi ra khỏi chốn này Sẽ tốt hơn hết khi chỉ có tôi  Dẫu vẫn thiếu người khác chỉ để thay thế đâu đó sự lẻ loi thôi Hình như tôi thấy ai với cánh tay Dẫu biết bao lần tôi gọi tới thì cũng đâu có ai đó hay chăng Rằng chẳng ai tin Cảm giác khi ngập trong sự lẻ loi Cưng à, nói cho nghe là Nói cho hiểu ra Tôi cần một sự giải thoát Hãy đưa tôi khỏi chốn này Tôi cần một sự giải thoát  Hãy đưa tôi khỏi chốn này Cuộc sống vốn đã không tròn đầy Cố gắng tốt hơn từng ngày Cứ đếm mấy tiếng rồi vì chẳng cảm thấy ấy nấy Lãng tránh với thứ đối nghịch lại Sô cô la đang ngậm lại Biết là sắp hết nhưng mà tôi vẫn cứ thế Một phút để xoá đi trục trặc Chẳng thể cắn răng đầu hàng Giây cứ tích tắc Cứ cứng nhắc ắt sẽ chắc Lại nhớ đến mấy khi Chẳng biết phải nghĩ chi Lại nốc tiếp cứ thế và cứ uống đến hết ly Sẽ tốt hơn hết khi chỉ có tôi  Dẫu vẫn thiếu người khác chỉ để thay thế đâu đó sự lẻ loi thôi Hình như tôi thấy ai với cánh tay Dẫu biết bao lần tôi gọi tới thì cũng đâu có ai đó hay chăng Rằng chẳng ai tin Cảm giác khi ngập trong sự lẻ loi Cưng à, nói cho nghe là Nói cho hiểu ra Tôi đã rơi xuống con sông trào Nơi toàn sự gian dối trao Chẳng còn cảm giác tồi tệ nào  Nhưng hoá ra người tốt chết sao Nơi đã cất giấu sự tự hào Nhưng chỉ còn ánh sáng sao Tôi đã tìm thấy lối ra vào Nhưng phía sau chỉ toàn điềm báo Chẳng thể tin được… Sẽ tốt hơn hết khi chỉ có tôi  Dẫu vẫn thiếu người khác chỉ để thay thế đâu đó sự lẻ loi thôi Hình như tôi thấy ai với cánh tay Dẫu biết bao lần tôi gọi tới thì cũng đâu có ai đó hay chăng Rằng chẳng ai tin Cảm giác khi ngập trong sự lẻ loi Cưng à, nói cho nghe là Nói cho hiểu ra",

  "I stopped doing drugs and my friends all said \"youre just really boring now\". I got my GED and my friends said \"youre just educated now that does mean youre smart\". I got good high paying job and until i got laid off my friends never wanted to call me. Now im leaving for the military and i got friends that i never talk to because \"you changed man. We dont like the new you\"  The whole point is dont surround yourself with people that keep you down. I still talk to them to let them know their gonna be stuck in the same place while i go off and do great things by myself. Just because i had the  drive to prove people wrong doesn\u0027t mean everyone else does. Sometimes its easier to cut those negative energys out of your life",

I never related to a song so much, this song helped me get through everything. Now, here I am again, three years later, listening to this song once again, after being betrayed by who I called my best friend. History is repeating itself over and over and over. Thank god I have more friends that have supported me, but I am tired of this happening. I hope to find more people that treat me how I deserve to be treated. If you are going through something similar, don\u0027t worry, everything will be ok. You will find someone that treats you right. You are not alone ❤️",

  "What did they do?",
  "@@Not_theSovietUnion Well, is kind of a long story but... What happened three years ago was that we were a group of three girls. I had known my best friend for about 9 years, and my other best friend for about 6. Yet they were always with each other and left me alone. So I started talking with the one I had known for 6 years about some things I didn\u0027t like my other best friend doing, because they hurt me and I wasn\u0027t brave enough to tell her directly (Big mistake) soo, the girl I was telling everything told my other best friend that I talked shit about her and made up things that had never happened. (Not including the part where she said worse things about her, plus, what I was doing wasn\u0027t even talking shit) so my best friend got mad at me and started following me during lunch, she insulted me, called me witch, made up false things to make me look bad, turned everyone against me, played with my feelings and yet she called herself the victim. I know I did a horrible thing, but I apologised to her and she didn\u0027t accept it and kept talking shit about me. Maybe I deserve it, I don\u0027t know.",
  "@@Not_theSovietUnion The most recent one, well, long story short, my best friend decided to date my ex-boyfriend. Even when I told her that it hurt me a lot, she didn\u0027t care. Then she left me alone to go with him.",

  "Here’s a song that you guys should know, Worlds Smallest Violin by AJR. My grandpa fought in World War Two He was such a noble dude I can’t even finish school Missed my mom and left too soon  His dad was a fireman  Who fought fires so violent  I think I bored my therapist  While playing him my violin Oh my god that‘s so insane Oh my god that’s such a shame Next to them, my shit don’t feel so grand But I can’t help myself from feeling bad I kinda feel like 2 things can be sad The world’s smallest violin Really needs an audience So if I do not find somebody soon I’ll blow up into smithereens  And spew my tiny symphony Just let me play my violin for you My grandpa fought in World War Two He was such a noble dude Man I feel like such a fool I got so much left to prove All my friends have vaping friends They’re so good at making friends I’m so scared of caving in  Is that entertaining yet? Oh my god that‘s so insane Oh my god that’s such a shame Next to them, my shit don’t feel so grand But I can’t help myself from feeling bad I kinda feel like 2 things can be sad The world’s smallest violin Really needs an audience So if I do not find somebody soon I’ll blow up into smithereens  And spew my tiny symphony Just let me play my violin for you Somewhere in the universe Somewhere someone’s got it worse Wish that made it easier Wish I didn’t feel the hurt The world’s smallest violin Really needs an audience So if I do not find somebody soon I’ll blow up into smithereens And spew my tiny symphony All up and down a city street While tryna put my mind at ease Like finishing this melody This feels like a necessity So this could be the death of me Or maybe just a better me Now come in with the timpanis And take a shot of Hennessy I know I’m not there mentally But you could be the remedy So let me play my violin for you",

(as far as i\u0027ve read, there are some things that are outside of the lore, like \"reach 100k on spotify\") There are casettes (which btw, he used a casette in Long Drives at the start to turn on the melody iirc, so that may be alot of songs, maybe future ones?)

Your love was  just  a game, because your loves a mess, and you stayed the same you pissed me  off just to give me stress,you played my heart like a game of chess, I  guess it\u0027s right the queen attacks the king. but I\u0027m too sad so I\u0027ll sing (Hook) Girl you had me in a checkmate, I knew you were deep fake but i thought i could fix you up, I just wanted to last and you fucked me up, and you broke my heart but you don\u0027t give a fuck about me i don\u0027t know your scheme i don\u0027t see the things you see so please oh (Verse 3) Always blocking corners girl you had me in a checkmate, ring around the rosey cause you\u0027re always playing mind games got me fighting demons had to move my horse to B8. Cheated on me twice and I can\u0027t deal with all this heart break went did it again and got me dealing with this heartache. Oh, can I get a break I don\u0027t wanna do this anymore she wants a retake  wait... (Hook) Girl you had me in a checkmate, I knew you were deep fake but i thought i could fix you up, I just wanted to last and you fucked me up, and you broke my heart but you don\u0027t give a fuck about me i don\u0027t know your scheme i don\u0027t see the things you see so please oh",

  "(Verse 1) Here I am with my ukulele, strumming in the rain, Tears in my eyes, and it’s causing me pain. Life was once so bright, but now it’s gone astray, I’ll play a sad song on my uke, to chase the clouds away. (Chorus) Ukulele in my hand, a heart heavy as lead, In this lonely world, I’m feeling so dead. Let the music weep, let my tears run free, With my uke and my sorrow, it’s just me. (Verse 2) The strings they weep, and the chords are blue, All the happy memories have bid adieu. In the dark of the night, under the pale moon’s light, I’ll serenade my sadness with all my might. (Chorus) Ukulele in my hand, a heart heavy as lead, In this lonely world, I’m feeling so dead. Let the music weep, let my tears run free, With my uke and my sorrow, it’s just me. (Bridge) The world goes on, but I’m stuck in the past, Wondering how love’s sweet melody didn’t last. The strums turn to sighs, as my soul takes flight, In the melancholy notes, I find my light. (Verse 3) The rain keeps falling, and my eyes are misty, Playing my ukulele, feeling so twisty. In the echoes of my chords, I find solace, it’s true, My sad song on the uke, it’s the best I can do. (Chorus) Ukulele in my hand, a heart heavy as lead, In this lonely world, I’m feeling so dead. Let the music weep, let my tears run free, With my uke and my sorrow, it’s just me. (Outro) So here I am, strumming through the night, With my ukulele, I’ll find my inner light. The sad song will play, but I’ll find my way, With my uke and my emotions, I’ll greet a brand new day.",

  "Nunca es habló acerca del iceberg de Amino y como todo ello influye interconectada mente con la historia de la serie... a continuación te relataré acerca de este iceberg y sus respectivos niveles, comenzando por lo que la mayoría conoce hasta lo que pocos saben... (No estará muy detallado porque me da paja escribir tanto) Nivel 1 (Punta del iceberg): -Flando y una menor: Flando encuentra a una chica por Amino donde ella le dice que tiene 2 años menos que el 16/18, hasta que cuando se juntan en persona ella le revela que la diferencia de edad era aún mayor 13/18, Flando justifica esto diciendo estar enamorado pero las relaciones sexuales de ellos fue inevitable. -Mañoso y su enfermedad: Mañoso desde que apareció en la serie se nos dejó en claro que su nivel Cognitivo no era muy elevado... esto eran teorías pero cada vez se pensaba más por decir que las personas veían a 60 fps, las vacas podían clonarse y los canguros eran provenientes de argentina... esto se confirmo 4 capitulos antes de que el se marchara del grupo principa... Mañoso poseía síndrome de espectro autista. -Todos los usarios de amino tienen problemas en la vida real: En reiteradas ocasiones se nos hace alusión al abandono, violación, maltrato y más.. y claro nuestro trio favorito bromea con eso... pero no queda en una sola broma... en un capitulo Tulio es banneado de un chat por haberle dicho a una chica que la violaron, esa chica realmente fue violada... eso justificaría el odio hacia a Tulio, los usuarios se unen para olvidar sus problemas y el se encarga de recordárselos aún estando alejados de la \u0027\u0027vida real\u0027\u0027 -Watong y su \u0027\u0027gusto\u0027\u0027 por las mujeres: Watong ha tenido novias en amino entre ellas Coni Watona y Madi cejas de perro (Las más reconocidas), con esto se nos deja en claro que watong siempre se fija en feas y putas, curiosamente siempre terminan odiando a Tulio Nivel 2 (Orilla del Iceberg): -Violaciones en clanes: Svg,",
