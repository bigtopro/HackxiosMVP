  "You have been working overtime so much lately; you must be under a lot of pressure. You are a strong person who considers others a lot and takes on everything yourself. I also know that no matter how strong a person looks on the outside, there will still be times of weakness inside. When you are tired, take a good rest. You have such high expectations of yourself, and things will definitely develop in the direction you hope for. Make sure to take good care of yourself! It\u0027s okay to lack confidence; if that is your most natural and comfortable self. It\u0027s also okay to escape; you know it is not the version of yourself you are looking forward to, but you will always be able to start over.",

  "Opinions are really difficult. If you go by fact, Meliodas. The reason why I say this is because the Demon King was able to easily injure Escanor during the noon timer and Meliodas is way stronger than the Demon King after becoming said the Demon King. But you could also make the arguement that the only reason why Escanor was injured was because he was borrowing sunshine for the last time, burning away at his lifeforce while he did so",

  "She is still with me. She is an overthinker. Suffers from panic attacks anxiety attacks and a lot of pressure about studies. When she overthinks she needs me to reassure her. But whenever she starts suffering at night. My father and brother step in my room to talk about my studies. I have such an environment in my family that i can not even talk about my teenage love. I dont know if they will accept positively when i talk about my lovelife but the fear inside me cannot tell them about my love. I fearrr a lotttt. I have boards results yet to come. I was always a topper and good scoring student. But if my results do not come as expected and i dont score good ranks in the engineering exams she will be made the reason by my family and its completely acceptable for them to think like that. There is only logical environment. She is preparing for medical entrance. I knew she cant study at home so i made plan to study at library together just because she could focus and wouldnt take pressure about her studies. I went to the library for 2 days later on my brother stopped me . I told him i cant concerntrate at studies inside room but he positively told me i will do everything just do ur work have fruits go and walk cisit new place but dont get buffled.  It was not that i was never there when she over thought but few times i was not there but i went straight back to her after i could .  I didnt just ignore her. But i dont think she would make this the reason to leave me . She is still with me but doesnt love me anymore her words and talks are killing me .even my enemy wouldnt do that to me. I want to see her happpy in her life i will accept each and every torture is she gets what she needs somewhere else. She says i am a coward but how do i tell her how tangled i am . I know she is tangled too but i cant explain my side to her. After my entrance i will cry out loud infront of my parents and teelll them how that boundary seperated her from me😭 i could have done better.  Teenage love hurts as hell. Now she is not anybody elses but not mine too. And it kills. It kills every single second. I will make myslef the reson for her destruction and life the rest of my life in regret and pain. She even cursed me the tears you have given me will not let you grow . I will she what you dom if that is what she wants then i am down . I am always down .   I will support my child with their lovelife and make a better environment😊 for them to talk baout emotion.  I have always wanted her happiness . She is my first love why wouldn\u0027t I? I wanted to be her safe place but her talks say I destroyed her😭 I am sorry my ful🌹 for not giving  you what you needed. If you can give me one more chance I will be the best 😭 Yours, Fattu(she gave me this name)",

  "A child is born weak in every way. Above all, he needs the affection he receives from his parents or caregivers. They are his role models, and he learns many of their habits. Over time, these habits become instinctive and are stored in memory, but he may also acquire wrong habits, such as favoritism towards siblings or other wrong habits. Religion may also be a wrong habit. A child\u0027s mind is not yet fully developed, so how can he choose a religion and learn about God at an early age? For example, reproduction in nature and science is natural. It is very likely that a child will come and worship strange things. For example, if I change my religion, leave my family, travel to a faraway country, get married, and have a child, my child will come and worship my new religion. What a wrong principle in choosing a religion! This is the greatest evidence that God created us with the heart and mind to know God when we grow up. I have a suggestion for you: Food and drink contain happy hormones. Fast for ten full days. Abstain from food and drink until sunset.  Go to your temple and repeat, fast for another ten days, go to the mosque and pray with the congregation. Read in your own language, and that\u0027s fine. Where does peace and tranquility come from when you are in direct communion with God? Life is short. How long will you live? More than a hundred years, and then you will die. Only your work will benefit you. Everyone will abandon you. If you like it, follow my posts and share the post so that everyone can benefit.",

  "JUSTICE FOR ENDOMETRIOSIS; “Don’t Underestimate The Power of a Lifetime Ahead.” Debbie Gibson, Electric Youth. “I am 30 and I have had this since I was 13.

A pandemic that brings forth barbaric torture to 330 million, what can be described much better than a 2013 National Institute of Health conclusion, drop dead gorgeous super beautiful heroines that save the world.  Its  a disease that if not treated before a so called “Young Endo Girl” is 15 causes a half century and half million dollars of failed excision surgeries. Instead of just one that can remove all of it when not too big, before it spreads to places no surgery or cure can remove, to eternally regrow faster than up to for some 20 or more excision surgeries can remove. There is no cure nor treatments that are worse than Endometriosis itself. Two of the most commonly described treatments Lupron and Orlissa causes suicidal contemplations in 38% of Endo warriors.  And the only effective management early in life prevention before 15 years old.  A parent should be able to tell if their daughter has Endo if they are normally vibrant, hard working pillars of society who are ready for school an hour before the mother or father are even out of the shower. But seemingly every month at the same time they complain of how much it hurts to urinate and defecate and change their tampons, eat, are nauseas  or even bend over and are still in bed long after the whole family is ready for car pool  departure.   And every month it gets longer and more intense.    The entirety of all Endometriosis is the lack of knowledge and awareness of parents who conclude their daughters as having a low pain threshold or carrying on wanting to get attention, having something they are always trying to get out of, being hysterical or for some paranoid parents their daughters trying to make them look abusive.  And instead of taking care of their daughters they discipline them and investigate what they are trying to get out of instead of investigating what is medically wrong with them.  Throughout their entire first half century of life, the most dignified family, friends, coworkers deal with their Endometriosis is to call them hypochondriacs. Even in ER’s they are dismissed seldom getting any type of medical care but some Tylenol or laxative. Tracey’s Lindeman’s book “Bleed” documents the medical gaslighting that mostly beautiful women are tortured by ignoring by the medical community. Most Young Endo girls then adult Endo warriors spend their lives hiding their symptoms as much as possible after spending their early lives being disciplined by parents and teachers, mocked by friends who they think they can confide.  Then by employers who  will most certainly fire them, demote them or give them so few hours not  to be able to pay even rent, let alone all the medical costs. Perhaps like how the greatest high school ever could have been the world’s first place, where adult Endo warriors could live in the rooms that the windows in this video show, who are too sick too often to afford to pay rent and food, to pay as ability allows. And the greatest high school ever could have been the first, place where Young Endo girls with abusive parents who discipline them for carrying on, causing a scene, making them look abusive or just trying to get out of something every month longer and longer every month could escape them  to live until able to afford their once needed surgery. Like Maggies Place was a place young teens escaped to when their parents told them to have an abortion or get out.     And of course how the little gym could have been the greatest pet shelter with pet therapy in between the Endo rescue and thebig gym being the homeless shelter and the cafeteria being the greatest homeless and Endo food assistance place.           I am so dedicated to making mine the greatest  nonprofit ever, that I was accepted ,to Nancy’s Nook so when it comes time to paying excision surgeons I have the most reliable information that exists in the world to make sure those Young Endo Girls aren’t using funds to a bad surgeon, or worse some ob/gyn who won’t who won’t have the skills, expertise or courage to as my 6th ranked Endo Warrior Courtney Budzyn cries,  “Gets it all out and not just what they feel  comfortable”.  Or my silver medalist Meghinl complained about, “I paid you tens of thousands of dollars along with what insurance paid you and you still left all sorts of Endo in there? That is going to be even worse in a year.” For an average of $50,000 a excision surgeon should realize that while they are trying not to do harm, the Endo they leave behind is doing harm.       I am going to make sure that just like every teacher took care of every Redmen in what was a perfectly fine building needed no repairs. I am going to make sure that every Young Endo girl gets a Nacy’s Nook endorsed surgeon who will live up the reputation of the highs school the funds were inspired by.        While Medicaid pays for the early in life excision that can  prevent a lifetime of barbaric financial, medical, personal, occupational torture for those Young Endo girls whose parent make up to $52,000 in a two person household or $62,000 for a three person household, most parents who make more than that seldom can afford the early in life preventative surgery. Without early in life prevention, endometriosis warriors are doomed to a life of barbaric torture ruining any quality of life until menopause. Nearly every day they experience periods of excruciating pain. Many times so intense it causes temporary blindness and frequent fainting. While perhaps the only more barbaric torture to the world other than Endo is Parma city School District’s CEO Charles Smialek who demolished the perfectly fine Parma  Senior High instead reuse until once again decades from now needed as a school to be a Lexi Young Kristen Vaganos Endometriosis Rescue, Pet Shelter, Homeless Shelter that could have brought the pcsd $7 million a year and saved millions of lives. But, a close contender for most barbaric atrocity was the final Bachelorette season, with Jenn Trann “Feel the Jenergy” instead of Lexi Young Endo Summer of 2024 “Where Love Conquers All.” My 14 month crusade for ABC to donate ad revenues retroactively and in the future to a Lexi Young Endo fund to pay for Young Endo girls Excision in honor of Lexi, legendary braveness ABC responded with disgusting barbaric ignoring sub human indecency trying to forget Endo even exists. Maybe someday, my Lexi Young Parma Senior High Endometriosis Foundation will lead to something like how the greatest night in TV history for 2:50 should have ended.   Viewers suffered the horrible ego of Jenn  ending in the appropriate  poetic justice of Devin having an affair with Maria. Instead of the Joey finale ending with Lexi surprised as the new Bachelorette with dozens of Young Endo girls waiting in hospitals for their surgeries already paid for by the LYEF she didn’t even know existed, with Daisy, Kelsey, Racheal, Maria  riding with her in the same van and black pants and brown sweater she is confused to be wearing, to the hospital. All with the closing scene.  Of Lexi getting a text message that she is not just the Bachelorette but  CEO with a sign from all the YEG’s waiting, “You’re going to give millions of us our lives.But we all hope you find your final rose in the Endo Summer of 2024.",

  "About 2 years ago, I met a very beautiful woman who was from the country of Myanmar (Burma). She immigrated to the United States along with her parents to escape an oppressive military dictatorship in her home country. From the moment I first laid my eyes on her, I felt a great love for her. Her personality, her smile, her voice, her hair, everything... She was just so beautiful to me. But what I didn\u0027t know was that she had a number character flaws. I was willing to overlook her flaws, but her and I ended up not getting along because of her negative traits. After less than 2 months, her and I broke it off in July 2023. Even though I only tried to be with her for such a brief moment of time, the memories of her still come back to haunt me. I find that still miss her from time to time. This song makes me think of her, especially the line that goes, \"You loved her too much, and you dive too deep.\" 😢 I\u0027ll never get another chance with her, so I just have to let her go, and carry on.",

Even Ethereum let SHIB go! They help create SHIB, creating wallets to reduce the circulating supply to increase SHIB\u0027s value 10 Billion in transactions per day how many SHIB did they reduce, zero. All they had to do is use 5% of the profits to reduce SHIB\u0027s circulating supply to make 10X more but this didn\u0027t know and they let her go! Now SHIB is controlled by the top 40 wallet holders, their holding 65%. Wonder how many of them are going to start reducing SHIB circulating supply to keep the status quo or will they her go?",

  "[The Girl I Never Met, But Found in Every Song] There are stories that never begin, and yet they linger like the last note of a haunting melody. Ours was one such story. We never met—at least not in the way the world measures meetings—but her presence etched itself into the corners of my existence like a soft echo that refuses to fade. She came into my life when the nights were heavy and the days were hollow. I was going through a really tough time, carrying weights I couldn’t name. And then, like a sudden breeze in a stifling room, there she was—someone who made the silence inside me feel understood. I don’t know how it happened, but talking to her felt like comfort in its purest form. With every conversation, I started imagining a life with her. Not the kind built with grand gestures or shared addresses, but one made of small hopes and quiet companionship. Deep down, I knew it was not possible. She had her path, her choices, and maybe someone else to hold her heart. But I still wished—just one day with her. One day to tell her everything. One day to be everything I never was for anyone else. I found her in songs I couldn’t stop playing, in lines I wrote but never sent, in dreams I didn’t dare speak out loud. She became that melody you hum when no one’s watching, that presence that feels more real than reality itself. I never met her, but I found her in every song I loved, every silence I held, every version of myself I was trying to become. She chose someone else. And maybe that’s how it was meant to be. But I will always be thankful for her presence in my life. For being a reason I kept going when I didn’t feel like it. For reminding me that even the impossible can be beautiful. \"some people you don\u0027t need to hold to Love. you just carry them, gently, endlessly in the quiet corner of your soul\"  a quiet chapter that I will carry within me… always !!",

Sweet, cute, kind- The kinda person that you would turn your life around for- But i have fummbled, and I fumbled bad.  She saved me from a dark pit- And I wuold eat glass if i needed to. Anywho- I confessed and got an \"Ok\". She is gradiateing soon- (Next week) so she has a lot on her plate right now.  I wont dull that butiful smile with me- So Ill take a step back- bite my toung and smile as she leaves. Future me, you had at LEAST 8 full months- And you lost the one in a trilion. You Don\u0027t have her number, mutual friends, or any way to contact her.  I do love her, I will miss her for years. You are not the best- Infact you are the worst.

  "Still remember this song. It was 2 in the night when we broke up  we talked till 7 in the morning, and that was our last call. After we cut the call I was alone in my flat. I can’t even describe that day. Silence was screaming, and I was screaming too. This song kept playing on loop... She was good. It’s just that she didn’t want anyone to affect her in any way. She didn’t want to give space to anyone in her mind. And with me... I guess I was disturbing her peace. But it’s fine now. Hopefully, she’s happy. I just wanted her to stay in my life. If this is how she was going to leave, why did she even let me come this close? I literally begged and cried on that last call, asking her to stay — but she didn’t. Why does everyone I try to hold on to eventually leave? Why does everyone I get close to walk away like this? Now, I’m in a place where I won’t let anyone come this close again. Because I know how it ends. Anyway, enough blabbering. Be happy, Mish.",

The hollow space in my heart was filled by the line, “only know you\u0027re lover when you let her go.” I proved to myself that I could really let go of the person I once held dearly; the person I loved darkly and possessively; the person I once loved the most and promised the future I aspire to.

  "It’s painful to care so deeply for someone, only to watch them walk away, seeking solace in someone else. Yet, no matter how much it hurts, you still find yourself here when they come back, hoping they\u0027ll choose you. It\u0027s like holding onto a piece of your heart that they keep breaking, but you can\u0027t seem to let go, even though it feels like you\u0027re slowly losing yourself in the process. Love shouldn’t be this painful, but you keep hoping they\u0027ll see the value in you before it\u0027s too late. (Btw am 13 turning 14 in 2025 but I already know a lot about life then my parents) it’s just so sad the way people don’t see the kindness in you.😂😂😂😂",

She is my best friend an my best lover I ever had.

  "Denger lagu ini karena meme yang di share di media sosial. Tapi ternyata terjemahan nya mirip dengan keadaan gw dan Bapak gw sendiri. Dulu dia masih hidup gw benci banget sama Bapak, karena sering banget berkata kasar ke anak sendiri, gak pernah buat ibu gw bahagia selalu menyisahkan keributan di rumah, gak tenang rasanya. Bahkan Abang gw juga ngebenci Bapak sampai dulu dia bilang ke Ibu buat cerai aja tapi yah gimana udah terlambat juga. Karena anak-anak nya udah pada dewasa, jadi ya nanggung? Jadi sampai akhir mereka tetep bersama sampai bapak udah gak ada. Tapi yang nyesek itu karena dulu saking marah nya gw sampai ngedumel. \"Mati aja sekalian\". Ke Bapak gw sendiri.  Ternyata dari omongan itu beneran terwujud waktu gw SMP Bapak gw meninggal.. disitu gw gak nangis atau apapun, dan tau? Perasaan bersalah itu baru gw sadari setelah dia udah di makam kan dan sudah tertutup tumpukan tanah dan batu nisan.  Gw nangis, bersalah, iya gw inget omongan jahat gw.. walaupun bapak gw gak pernah sekalipun ngomong-ngomong hal baik ke gw, dari dulu masih kecil sampai gw remaja. Tapi, pernah suatu waktu Bapak gw dateng ke mimpi sambil ngucapin maaf ke gw dalam keadaan wajah yang gak gw kenalin.. samar banget tapi gw ngerasa sedih denger kata-kata dia yang minta maaf ke gw sendiri. Dan gw baru sadar ketika orang itu udah gak ada, udah gak ada kesempatan buat mencintainya lagi.  Sekarang gw berusaha buat ibu gw bahagia.. bahkan untuk masa depan gw.. gw mau mendedikasikan diri gw sepenuhnya untuk ibu gw.. sampai waktu itu habis. Tapi tolong jangan ambil ibu gw sebelum gw bisa menghasilkan uang sendiri.",

  "To the People of 2090 I want you to know that from 2019 to 2025, Earth was not the easiest place to live. We faced relentless hardships— the devastating invasion of the Coronavirus, wars between superpowers like Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Palestine, and conflicts in places like Congo. Life was tough, uncertainty was everywhere, and the world felt like it was on fire.   But amidst the chaos, there was a light—a musician named Passenger. He wasn’t just a singer; he was a storyteller, a healer through music. His songs carried us through the darkest times, offering comfort when the world seemed unbearable. He reminded us to hold on, to find beauty in the little things, and to keep hope alive.   We loved him deeply, not just for his talent but for the way his music became a refuge. He was more than an artist; he was a companion in the storm. If his songs have made it to your time, listen to them. Feel them. Because music, no matter the era, has the power to heal.   With hope,   A voice from the past",

  "The rain tapped softly on the window as I sat in the quietness of my apartment, the echo of her laughter still living in the walls. The plants we chose together, the playlist we built, the empty side of the couch—it all whispered her name. She was gone now, and with her, a part of my heart. Days turned to weeks, and grief became a companion—silent, but ever-present. One evening, drawn by the need to clear my mind, I wandered into a small café. Soft music played—a familiar tune, Let Her Go. The lyrics hit me like a wave, but this time, they felt different. Across the room, someone else sat alone, lost in the music. The eyes met—just a glance, but it felt like a conversation. A shared story of loss, perhaps. When the song ended, so did something inside me. That was not sadness, but the fear. I smiled—a small, uncertain smile, but a beginning nonetheless. Because endings, no matter how painful, aren’t final. They are the soil from which something new can grow. 💙🌙 Every ending makes space for a new beginning.",

  "LEXI YOUNG BACHELORETTE  RIP ENDO SUMMER OF 2024 WHERE LOVE CONQUERS ALL JUSTICE FOR  ENDOMETRIOSIS The Bachelorette was cursed, and after the worst decision in not just TV but everything, choosing Jenn Tran where the worst season of any tv show made everyone not want to  “ Bring on the Jennergy” instead of “Lexi Young: Endometriosis Summer of 2024” “Where Love Conquers All.” Where millions of lives and billions of hours of suffering could have been saved by donating a large portion of ad profits for all future Bachelors and variations and all ABC shows even Retroactive to all previous Bachelors to a Lexi Young Endometriosis Foundation that Lexi the 4.0 gpa MIT graduate and now world’s best digital strategist would be CEO. By now millions of poverty level Young Endo Girls, that the LYEF would focused on could have gotten the live saving, before 15 years old excision surgery when it is small enough to get out entirely before it spreads all over their bodies to places that no surgery or cure can get out. At a lifetime medical cost of a half million dollars and lost wages in failed excisions and treatments that are worse than Endometriosis itself. Not only would hundreds of millions of dollars been raised by now, but tens of millions of viewers could have learned all about the most barbaric torture to the most drop dead gorgeous super beautiful heroines that save the world and how when they come out are abandoned by friends, employers, fiancés due to Endophobia. Where male bachelors who once abandoned an Endo Warrior get Lexi through Endo flares(like the one that was in the initial phase when Lexi was on “Women Tell All.”, medical gaslighting, vomiting due to endo that spread to the stomach, passing out in the bathroom due to Endo that spread to the bladder and colon.  Getting to the hospital when they bend over and burst an ovarian cyst like Joey and Jesse did for Lexi. All not just for the final rose but the Joey Grazedi  title of “greatest guy in the world” decided by the greatest heroine in the world Lexi Young. While Joey and Jesse deserve the title greatest Endo guys in the world.  My hometown Parma, Ohio  Parma City School  district Superindentant Charles Smailek is without doubt the worst Endo person in the world demolishing a prestine Parkview Elementary School that was being reused, providing  lifesaving services to thousands who are now homeless, starving or dead. But, the greatest built and greatest high school in the world Parma Senior High that I crusaded to be the first Lexi Young/Kristen Vaganos Endometriosis Rescue for those who can’t work enough hours to afford rent with endophobia making it impossible it impossible to even find a roommate who can deal  with it. And to the parentally abused Young Endo girls whose Endo is  brutalized with life destroying parents who discipline them thinking they are just carrying on, being hysterical, trying to get out of something every month or even trying to make them look bad. Instead of investigating what could be medically wrong with them and getting the early in life life saving surgery.  With the motto and belief proclaimed in Debbie Gibson’s  Electric Youth” “Don’t Underestimate the Power of A Lifetime Ahead”. Instead of the high school becoming the humanitarian capital of the world, it sits forever a empty green space forever for a megaschool every single PCSD resident alive doesn’t want and hates that our beloved school was torn down and not reused to save Endo warriors lives About a quarter million residents are suffering with some dead in the Parma City School District Area instead of a quarter million Endo Warriors having their lives saved in a place Smialek demolished that could have provided life saving shelter and a place abused Young Endo girls could live amongst themselves, all inspired by someone who inspired millions to come out of the Endo closet. Yet ABC decided to put back in the closet and instead of what is now the last ever Bachelorette, could have been the first ever humanitarian motivated Bachelors and Bachelors focusing on the marital vow, “In sickness and in health, For better or worse. Til death do us part.” Quick sidebar….Kristen Vaganos who has more than earned and saved the character should be the eternal “Molly Lansing Davis” on “General Hospital.” For playing the first and only in all drama character to have Endometriosis. For which evidence would indicate Vaganos also has it… Like two decadeago on GH both Natalia Livingston and “Emily Quartermaine” had breast cancer.    Rest in Peace Leslie Charleson. There is no cure for the 330,000.000 Endo Warriors though out the world, 40 million  in America, whose daily lives and painful torture are so horrible that 39% contemplate suicide on an ongoing basis. Where the only thing that can be done now is early in life prevention.  Instead of the “The Power is in her hands” being used for Jenn Trann in a vending machine swing picking out guys. It could have been used for the LYEF giving abused young endo girls a way to get their surgeries without parents wanting to spend the money.  What was last year the four greatest moments in all of culture. Daisy’s “The truth  is, you aren’t going to pick me.” Then her hugging Kelsey saying’ Your Mom is looking down from heaven now” and her famous line “If You Love The Wrong Person this much how much will I love the right person. And the gold and silver revealing of Lexi in Malta telling Joey and the greatest moment ever in Monteal we all remember and the greatest line and hug goodbye ever,,,”I Love You Joey.Good Luck hope you find your final rose.”  Viewers suffered the horrible ego of Jenn  ending in the appropriate  poetic justice of Devin having an affair with Maria, continued on in Dancing With the Stars. Instead of the Joey finale ending with Lexi  surprised as the new Bachelorette with dozens of Young Endo girls waiting in hospitals for their surgeries already paid for by the LYEF she didn’t even know existed, with Daisy, Kelsey, Racheal, Maria and even Jenn  riding with her in the same van and black pants and brown sweater she is confused to be wearing, to the hospital. All with the closing scene.  Of Lexi getting a text message that she is not just the Bachelorette but voted CEO with a sign from all the YEG’s waiting, “You’re going to give millions of  what you used to be love and life….But we all hope you find your final rose in the Endo Summer of 2024. For while their abnormal levels of estrogen bless the world with overpowering beauty, radiance, prettiness, picturesque professionalism, overwhelming intelligence, skill, talent , abilities, all used for unfathomable morality, ethics, wholesomeness and humanitarianism. The same estrogen we are blessed totures them by fertilizing their Endometriois and a hundred other related diseases. Typical symptoms of Endo are far worse than just painful periods, tampon insertion, but include horrible pain with urination and defecation. Leg pains, back pains, and at least once weekly such barbaric pain spread through out the central nervous system causing such immense migraines that they go blind. There are many resources online by goggling if one believes she has Endo for while symptoms destroy quality of life as early as 11 and last until menopause, misdiagnosis  and hundreds of thousands of dollars and years of suffering continue until at least 26 like Lexi finally ended as she explained to Joey. While Jenn Tran will most certainly go down in history as the person who is most responsible for the ending of a TV show…Lexi Young as last years Bachelorette would have gone down in history as the greatest cultural human life saving entity of all time. And would have provided the Endo world and all those who love them. HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. THAT  WE’LL FIND TOMORROW STEVE BAYT PARMA,OHIO",

The promise was to spend my life loving her. She said i didn\u0027t care about her and left. I thought i was going to marry her. I was about to. I loved her more than anything. And istill do.

Hoy después de más de 10 años de haberla escuchado, solo me recuerda la fuerza de su letra, lo real e idílica pero realista que es. Hoy dejé ir de alguna manera algo que en serio no sé cómo reemplazar, es un vacío tan grande que literalmente solo creo que puede ser llenado por ella, dejo que parta con dolor pero con la tranquilidad de que trate de hacerlo lo mejor. Sin duda el tema y ella simplemente están inmortalizados en mi de una forma que saca que sea abuelo me acordaré, y vendré por acá a comentar si se nos volvió a dar(espero que sí) que la cuiden demasiado, en exceso. Porque es todo lo que quise y trate de hacer, ojalá sea un hasta pronto michi. Te amo",

  "🥰❤謝謝你❤感謝你愛心💯💯💯❤尊敬佩服❤鞠躬 財運         捨方能得，不捨不得，捨即佈施。1.財佈施得財富。         2.法佈施。凡是別人想知道、想學習的合于正道的方法，只要自己懂、自己會，就熱心去教，能夠得聰明智慧的果報。         3.無畏佈施。即在眾生身心不安、恐懼害怕時，能夠幫助其消除恐懼，如此會得健康長壽的果報。         曾有一個學員功德很大，自己捐助了許多貧困的孩子，家裡還養了八個孩子，親生的卻只有兩個。離婚後跟她婆婆說：「我什麼都沒給過妳，我給妳買處房子。」就將僅有的幾萬塊錢奉獻給了婆婆，之後她每年仍堅持過年過節及婆婆生日去孝敬婆婆，很令人感動。此外，她每年都要親自去貧困地區捐款，送一些衣物。她當初沒錢，從一個拾破爛的到今天有了自己的生意，並有兩處房子，這都是捨來的。         貪小便宜吃大虧的道理。這個易經太極圖，出去的是一個魚尾巴，回來的卻是一個大腦袋。要是貪小便宜，等到明年吃虧就比今年大。         什麼叫貪小便宜？比如把單位的信封、信紙等東西帶回家，單位分東西時先挑好的，為講價錢跟做小買賣的爭吵等等。古人曾訓誡：「于肩挑小販、苦力，莫討便宜。」         貪心過重的表現，讓人賺不到什麼錢，那他們怎麼活？社會怎麼發展？ 提示：你要求別人的時候，你要先付出，因果才能成立。         你怎麽樣對人，人亦會怎麼樣對你。人與人交往一定要守時，你不守時要求別人守時沒有道理。欠人東西一定要還的，欠人時間也一樣要還的。人家要你幫助時，你常說等一下，你自己去辦事就不要怪別人要你等一下了。         改造命運只能靠自己改。         逢人要說好話，這是別人對你說好話的因。每天對人施捨笑容，施捨好話，可以使身邊的人身心安樂，這也是行善！         有一個老人特別省，我到他家一看，全是破爛堆，他還說：「我勤儉節約」。我說：「你家倒楣事也多。」他說：「是，我也不知道怎麼回事。」「你貪心啊！有捨不得的心，財運就不行。」他問：「那我怎麼變財運？」「你把家裡的破爛捨一捨、賣一賣，支援國家建設。」他問：「靈嗎？」我說：「靈！」他把破爛賣完了，他兒子多年沒找到工作，結果找著了。 舉一個例子：        上了公共汽車，一元錢。剛好，只有一張十元，放了十元進投幣箱，感覺我的十元沒有白花，那你種了9元錢的種子。 提示：捨的時候不太樂意，得的時候也會困難，這是現實中眾多的人為什麼來錢那麼困難的原因。 「好讀書，不求甚解」。這是一句好話，現代人不明白這個也是讀書捷徑。選一些好書給還沒有上小學的小朋友讀，不要解釋，讓他們每天讀，慢慢他們就能夠背下來，背下來後還要每天早晚讀，慢慢心中就會平靜下來，產生定力；心有定力，知識才能轉化為智慧，為自己所用。         科學家曾做了一個試驗，把一支玻璃試管插入水的容器內，然後，收集人們在不同心態下的「氣水」，結果發現了：當一個人心平氣和時呼出的氣體變成水後，澄清透明，無色；悲痛之時水中有少許白色沉澱；生氣時則有紫色的沉澱。當他們把受試者生氣時呼出的「生氣水」，注射到一隻大白鼠身上，幾分鐘後大白鼠就死了。         免疫力可以通過身體鍛煉等多種途徑得以增強，但是，人心理的平靜度才是免疫力的本源。         發怒是「火燒功德林」，將你以前辛苦積累的福德化為灰燼。特別是針對自己的時候，千萬不能起嗔恨心。用別人的錯誤來懲罰自己，損失太大了！ 生氣恨心者命還是不好，悲傷完了並不生氣者，命運會很快好轉，事業開始轉運。 氣恨心重的人命多悲慘，隨和謙讓的人命特好，得天之道。若生氣恨心，以後就會發生一件生氣的事，若天天如此，堆積太多了，災害必降。         有的女孩問我怎麼變漂亮，我說：「天天微笑，三年以後必見成效。」        老人窮，我教他參：     1.「我不應該受不了好」。受不了好就是跟自然力較勁，給錢不要，自然力就不給你了，不給你又生氣又埋怨：「我怎麼這麼窮、這麼苦？」   2.多參自己說的過頭話，「爭取變成好東西，好東西沒錢。」 3.「有那麼多錢有什麼用？我夠吃夠喝就得了。」心口如一，自然力會保佑這樣的人，心口不一。自然力讓你夠吃喝，有事時沒錢。 4.「我不應該看不上別人。」 你看不上別人，別人就看不上你的店。 5.「我不應該跟人較勁」。 你較勁，客戶就跟你較勁。 6.人不能有私心，發財應該先祝願客戶都能得到滿意的結果，能給他們帶來優質的服務和美好的回憶。 書名：周老師講心法 好書：弟子規。         于道光先生說：某夜，有個書生路過東嶽廟，有個人竟然從緊閉的廟門中穿了出來，書生便撲向前去，跪倒在地，嘴巴還直嚷嚷著：神明顯靈啦！那人立刻伸手將他攙扶起來，並對他說道：「這位仁兄誤會了，我並不是你口中所謂的神明，我是右臺司鏡官，出差到此來遞送統計資料的。」 「莫非就是在管理那面辨別世間善惡的業力鏡嗎！」 「你剛才所提的業力鏡，顯現的人表現在外的善行與惡事。」 「諸天神明便決議，將原來業力鏡移到左臺，用來顯現人的作為；再於右臺增設這一面心鏡，讓人可以清楚地看到他們的內心。清澈潔淨如水晶的人，就是千中選一。而我的工作就是當人面對心鏡時，從旁記錄鏡中所顯現的一切，每三個月一次，將所記的資料送到東嶽大帝座前，作為降罪賜福的依據。至於這降罪賜福的標準，則是名氣越大，對其要求自然也就越高、越嚴；掩飾的伎倆越是精細，那麼處罰也就越重。」         書生聽完後，便再三向神官拜謝。 作者 紀曉嵐        德澤蔭後         宛平縣有個陳鶴齡。他弟媳要求分家另居。弟媳說：「大哥你是一個男子漢，能多方經營。我只是一個寡婦女流，子女又小，請你把家產分給我三分之二。」         陳鶴年說：「弟媳說的是，應當依從她。」         弟媳又以孤寡不能出去追索欠債為藉口，要求再把現有財貨分成兩份，而把多年以來債主尚未償還的債券，加上利息，作為鶴齡應得的那一份，鶴齡也委屈地應承下來了。後來那些債券，大部分都沒辦法索取，鶴齡因此陷入極端貧困之中。這是乾隆丙午（1786）年發生的事。         這一年，鶴齡的兒子陳三立，在鄉試考中舉人。我有一位同年名叫李步玉，他和陳鶴齡住處相近，得知三立考中舉人，說：「皇天終究還是沒有虧待好心的人。」 淳樸得福         御史胡牧亭先生講了一個故事：他的家鄉有一位富翁，這人並不善於賺錢謀生，但他的財富總像是用不完，他不懂得調養身體，但他一輩子也沒得過什麼大病，有時碰到災禍，也會意外得到解決。         一次，偶然有人扶乩召仙，鄉人就以這個疑問來請教乩仙。         乩仙判語說：「這位富翁上輩子，他淳樸敦厚，絲毫沒有與人計較之心；他悠悠忽忽，從來沒有患得患失之慮；他雖然落落漠漠，但待人平等，心中無愛無憎；他襟懷坦蕩，總是直心直行，無偏無私。有人欺侮他，他不與之爭競；有人欺騙他，他不心生巧詐；有人以惡言誹謗他，他既不心懷嗔恨，也不嗔怒於人；有人捏造罪狀陷害他，他也不報復。一生平庸，老死於茅舍，並沒有什麼功德，獨有那顆淳樸善良的心，卻為神明所欣賞，所以降福於他，使他今生終身幸福。」         胡先生所講的這個故事，從情理上說，世間倒真有這種情況。 書名   紀曉嵐寫的因果故事 1.為人施捨財物，救急扶危 叫做善，行善的人，將來準富，因為天不虧人。 2.天理是，明中施捨，暗裏天還，為了義舉盡心竭力，任勞任怨，叫做功，有功於世的人，會有權柄，因為捨己為人是出貴的根。 3.人借行善立功，把性情練得爐火純青。遇逆境都能和顏悅色地忍受，死心化性，才叫做德。有德性的人，才能立住萬古。             因為救人的性是一救萬古。人能做到善功德三個字，就是聖賢了。             好佔便宜的人長陰命（造惡業）；好生怨氣的人消宿命（損福報）；好動性（耍脾氣）的人，消天命（損智慧）。         怨人是苦海，越怨心裏越難過，以致於不是生病，就是招禍。 笑不但除病還能轉命 生氣容易上火，哪能不生病呢？若能不怨人，可以解無量的冤。找好處能生啟發力，能接萬人緣，是消因果的根。 書名   王鳳儀善人行道實錄 歡迎翻印 成為「富翁」的三個要項： 1.多存錢： 也就是「做好事」及「存好心」。 2.少花用： 在心念上要「除惡念」。 在行為上能「少享福」。 3.提高利率（或報酬率）： 【心量放大】，念念為廣大眾生！不斷淨化心靈，放下放下再放下！ 祈願每個人在這個宇宙銀行裡，都能成為大富翁！ 書名   最大銀行 作者   丞捷",

If you really love the person you wanted to come back by your cuddle and side. learn to let them go, Because the name might be frequently repeated in your mind just haunt you and make you feel discomfortable, Do not worry, It’s not a bad ending, We all learn from past mistakes For Unrequited love: Even if you try to hate relationships because she or he doesn’t even love you back, Learn to *Let them go*",

It\u0027s just that I didn\u0027t shed a tear because of disbelief that we\u0027re going to say how 2020 was 5 years ago, how 2020 only accelerated our time and our lives because of the quarantine and the corona that gripped the whole world. I have the feeling that, for example, 2020 was quite normal like other years, that time would not pass so quickly and that we would make some new memories. This song, like all the others, will always remind me of that beautiful period of my life, of that time when memories were made. So that sometime in the future I will come back and read this comment that I wrote from the heart, just to encourage me to remember some beautiful moments 🥲 Edit: Happy New Year 2025",

  "❤給看這留言的你❤是俊美大大善人尊敬佩服 ❤鞠躬❤祝福你健康平安❤財源廣進❤萬事如意❤ 說話低聲軟語，安詳穩重，寬宏大量，知人優點，遇事能找人好處，有義氣，準有人緣。 知足之人常樂，能忍之士身自安。與其能辯不如能忍。傷害人的事不要說，現在的事做了再說，有多少力量就做多少事，不要心存等待，等待就會落空。 同情心為別人的困苦和可憐處、難處而著想愛心。能理解對方的心情最為可貴，也是最重要的。說話要達到對方的意，就是理解對方的心情。如果不理解對方的可憐處、難處、心理要求和接受能力，只是要求對方像我所想去做，就是苦了對方。不僅事與願違，同時也給對方造成很大壓力，自己也會感到苦惱。 (有同情心可以增加自己財運、福報和逢兇化吉逃過一劫機會）  🥰♥️真的感謝你💯♥️💯好愛心好聰明你真棒💯♥️好寬宏大量好帥你真棒💯♥️尊敬佩服♥️鞠躬 說話和言詞，要善良柔和、守信用，又能為別人著想，說話自然有份量。 多多作積極的鼓勵和讚美，使人感到快樂，產生自信心，就會努力自動自發去學習，讓後來的表現更為優秀。 對人加以尊敬慈愛，體貼關心、同情協助，與人相處盡量保持和藹，經常微笑😊，處處表現有禮貌和體貼，使人感到溫暖和愉快，有機會盡量替人服務。 說話注意口德，不要傷害別人的自尊和名譽，有機會盡量助人遷善改過，建立自信心，教人明白是非善惡，以免誤入歧途。 愛護動物 竇禹鈞常送衣服、常送食物、常捐財物，救濟窮困之人，請老師免費教導小孩讀書，後來，他五個孩子都揚名於世。竇儀（禮部尚書）竇翱（右諫議大夫）竇儼（禮部侍郎）竇侃（右補闕）竇僖（起居郎）         漢朝有位于公，有一次他家大門壞了，于公說：管工，大門可蓋高大一些。管工說：大人，為什麼？于公說：因為我平時處理獄政時，從未冤枉過一個人，將來子孫必定興盛發達！這樣的大門，未來可方便駟馬大車進出！ 後來他的兒子于定國當了宰相，孫子于永侶做了御史大夫。         明朝的趙籍，與人交往時，見到別人有善行，必定逢人到處表揚，這個人聽到了，便愈喜歡更樂意為善。又勸導人說某件事也是善事 ，可以互相勉勵的做；某件事看來像是好事，而實際上是壞事，我們不可以做。 趙籍利用表揚人的善行時，兼勸眾人行善時；並在勸善中兼勸阻人們為惡 。趙籍遏惡揚善，終身行之不倦，享有高壽，且名列仙籍登仙去。         宋朝韓琦，當主國政時，讀書人每天以文章獻給他，好的就抄起來背誦，並說：「我的文章不能作得比他更好!」至於差的，就親自藏起來，不給人看。有人做善事就說：「這人是君子!」 韓琦說：「現在人才，獎勵提拔，還怕不能振作，哪容得稍有挫折!如果責惡過於嚴格，就會斷絕他自新之路，那麼就會自暴自棄，我身為宰相要為朝廷培養人材，所以看到他人的得失，就如自己的得失。」 韓琦後來五福均得，其子封為王爵，其女為帝后，子孫代代為官，南宋末年，還有作宰相的人。 別人灰心的時候，一句鼓勵的話，能使人絕處逢生；別人失望的時候，一句讚美的話，能使人重見光明。 看到都是別人的優點，心裏存在別人的優點，就是存正能量，能吸引錢運和身體健康福報。 做人處世，心存厚道，不要得理不饒人，擺出一付氣勢凌人的樣子。所謂：「話不可說完、事不可作絕、勢不可用盡」，凡事要留退路。 (凡事若過於極端、絕斷，不留點空間作為後路，必有後患。) 飲食七分飽，精神才會好；講話留三分，日後相見好。 (少吃得長壽，可以省時間，省下時間拿來幫助別人，別人強過自己，要敬重他，向他學習。多多原諒別人，把度量放大，就會得到多多福報。) 助人者，人恆助之；念起善心，自然有善果。 (人幫人必得人幫，天會安排另外一個人出現來幫助你。生出善心可自救，又可以救人。) 貪求或易怒是煩惱，知足、感恩、惜福是快樂。 (凡事要懂得內斂，不要過於招搖，免得遭人嫉妒，惹事上身，傲長則人厭，縱欲則傷神，志滿則遭怨，樂極則生悲。) 孝順父母要一生說話和品德，不要讓父母擔心，能懂得改過也是懂得做一件善事，讓父母得到安慰。 自己要會主動去做會學習，不要讓父母操心。 🥰❤💯謝謝你愛心💯❤感謝你愛心💯❤感恩❤尊敬佩服❤鞠躬",

  "I’m not 1000% how it started but if I’m correct then it was when one of my friends tried to wake the other blasting this in his ear after falling asleep on a bus… regardless my friend group started meming this song, using it to wake each other up if we fell asleep, humming it randomly, or referencing it if one of us came across something with the words “let her go.” I first knew it as the “nenenenenenene” song.  It was only after we graduated when actually listened to the song in full. Now, after we have all moved away to different colleges, I am hit with so many emotions as I listen…  Although my association with this song is non romantic, it makes me remember the creation and evolution of my friend group over senior year and all of the memories we made in school and over the summer. I didn’t realize at the time how much I should’ve treasured those moments before they became memories, but I am fortunate enough to remain very close with these friends even now - something I hope to remain true for a long long time.  I’m not completely sure why I’m writing this but I think I’ll always be grateful for the power of song to help me feel and remember. Sam, Parth, Owen, and Jonah, even though you may never see this, I’m so thankful to have known you.",

  "Felizmente, não precisei deixar ir pra saber que a amava, contudo, ao vê-la sair da minha vida senti o sentimento mais angustiante que poderia experenciar, o  ponto chave dessa música, a dor da ausência e a valorização do que foi e não é mais, o senso de valor após a perda. A falta que ela fez, presente em cada gesto carinhoso e sutil,  no convívio, brincadeiras, no afeto, nos bons momentos, me afogou na culpa e arrependimento, tentei valorizar oque perdi, mas já era tarde... No fim, após ter mergulhado profundamente em um abismo de sofrimento, consegui emergir e... me encontrar. Oque senti ao preencher meus pulmões de ar novamente foi paz e gratidão...  ao conceber que ressignifiquei a dor por uma lição que me ajudou a crescer como individuo e fazer diferente. Hoje, após levantar e escolher seguir em frente,  ainda que ela não esteja ao meu lado, ou compartilhando a vida comigo, a envio amor todos os dias. Aprendi, que amar é muito mais que um mero contato ou demonstração física rotineira, na verdade, amar também é saber deixar ir, dói mas é o melhor que podemos fazer por nós e pelo próximo!   Se algo tiver de permanecer em sua vida, permanecerá, se não, abra mão, deixe ir e abrace as circunstâncias, seja livre!",

  "Dear person whoever reads this, Hey, you, yes, I am talking right to you. I hope you will see yourself with the eyes I see you with one day, because I can tell you have some awesome music taste. You’re such a beautiful human being and worth enough. I hope you know that you do only need yourself to be happy. I know society builds up the standard that whenever you’re alone, you’re not living a happy life. But in fact, that is not true. If you start to realize that you actually deserve all the good things happening to you, you will treat yourself a lot nicer. I hope you let yourself rest; don’t beat yourself up over past mistakes, over regret, and over everything your mind wants to destroy you. I wish I could remove all those demons inside of your head because you deserve to feel happy. If you ever feel lonely, then watch the sky, because you know, someone, at the same time, is watching the sky too, maybe feeling the same way. I am glad you exist, and I hope you won’t ever remove your own spot in this world. Maybe you don’t feel like you belong here, but, Angel, then build your home here. I don’t want you to leave this world unhappy. I want you to live every little second. I want you to feel alive. I don’t want you to see yourself just existing. You deserve it. Whatever happened, it’s not your fault. The demons in your head recognize that you have a beautiful heart; they want to take it because they have never seen such a beautiful heart as yours, so why let them win over you? You’re not selfish for isolating yourself, but you deserve to talk to someone. If you’re reading this, then please never forget to breathe and smile. Don\u0027t live up to other standards! It’s your story and not theirs. Live for those who couldn’t. Smile for those who forgot what a genuine smile is. Love like there’s no other. And hug like it\u0027s your last one. I love you and send you hugs. You’re so strong; you’re still here, and I am proud of you YOU ARE NOT USED. Read that AGAIN. YOU ARE WORTH IT. Read that AGAIN. YOU ARE LOVED. Read that AGAIN. I AM GLAD YOU EXIST. Read that AGAIN. You are not a problem. YOU ARE HUMAN AND YOUR FEELINGS ARE VALID. Read that AGAIN. YOU ARE NOT BEING DRAMATIC. You’re not a burden to anyone; don’t be afraid to talk or to use your voice. You’re beautiful inside out. Your body is beautiful the way it is. Please don’t starve yourself. Please eat. I know it’s hard, but you deserve food. You deserve to eat and drink. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. Read that AGAIN. I WISH I COULD HUG YOU RIGHT NOW, SO A VIRTUAL HUG WILL DO. It hurts me to see you’re in pain. You deserve kindness; don’t let your emotions control you. Don’t let them get the best of you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Please don’t go. I am sorry that no one is hearing you. I am sorry no one is noticing that you have lost yourself. I wish I could take your pain away; it hurts me to see the pain in your eyes. I love you through my words, and I mean it. I just want you to stay; hold on a little longer, okay? Please? For me?? I hope you have an awesome day/morning/evening/night. If it’s night for you, go to sleep. I know it’s hard to fall asleep right now, but you deserve a good sleep. If you have nightmares, please don’t let them fight you. If it’s a day for you, don’t start it with such sad music. I know it’s impossible to have a good day with such a mindset, but take baby steps. Start by drinking two cups of water in the morning, and so on. You will start building little healthy habits. If it’s evening for you, you’re probably overwhelmed and stressed. I want you to know it’s okay to feel the way you feel. You don’t need to be scared; of course you’re overwhelmed or stressed. I mean, who wouldn’t? But it’s important to know that when you feel that way, you should do a little self-care, such as taking a bath, for example. You deserve to feel at ease and relaxed. And if you are somewhere in between, I hope you know that you’re stronger than you think. I know you will make it. Now wipe those tears away and smile for me. You really don’t know how much a smile can brighten someone’s day, do you? I hope one day yours will become a genuine one where you don’t need to fake it anymore, because I can’t say this enough; you deserve a good smile and to feel alive. You’re worth more than every cent in this world. Remember, crying is not weakness; let it out as much as you can, but don’t let the emotion control you by giving up. It’s okay, you’re here, you’re safe, you can let it out. Did anyone ask you how you are feeling today? If not, how are you really? I don’t think you’re doing well, but you will feel good at some point. Don’t give yourself up. I am sorry you feel misunderstood. But anyone who gets to be with you doesn’t know how lucky he is/she is/they are. Enough with beating yourself up for today, okay?!  I hope this is enough for you to stay today; tomorrow will be a new day, a new start. Let go now. I hope you can stay. This is your sign to stay and treat yourself with love; you deserve it. And in case no one told you today, again, I am so proud of you. I hope you will remember my words. May we meet one day. Until next time, my dear friend. — The stranger that cares about you more than anything.",

  "Well you only need the light when it\u0027s burning low Kau butuh cahaya hanya saat gelap datang menjelang Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Rindukan mentari hanya di saat salju mulai turun Only know your lover when you let her go Mengenal kekasihmu hanya saat kau melepaskannya Only know you\u0027ve been high when you\u0027re feeling low Mengerti bahwa kau bahagia hanya saat kau sedang bersedih Only hate the road when you\u0027re missing home Membenci jalan hanya saat kau rindu rumah Only know your lover when you\u0027ve let her go Mengenal kekasihmu hanya saat kau telah melepaskannya And you let her go Dan kau melepaskannya Staring at the bottom of your glass Menatap dasar gelasmu Hoping one day you will make a dream last Berharap suatu hari nanti kau kan abadikan mimpi The dreams come slow and goes so fast Mimpi-mimpi datang perlahan dan pergi begitu cepat You see her when you close your eyes Kau melihatnya saat kau pejamkan matamu Maybe one day you will understand why Mungkin suatu hari nanti kau kan mengerti sebabnya Everything you touch all it dies Segala yang kau sentuh, semuanya binasa But you only need the light when it\u0027s burning low Tapi kau butuh cahaya hanya saat gelap datang menjelang Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Rindukan mentari hanya di saat salju mulai turun Only know your lover when you let her go Mengenal kekasihmu hanya saat kau melepaskannya Only know you\u0027ve been high when you\u0027re feeling low Mengerti bahwa kau bahagia hanya saat kau sedang bersedih Only hate the road when you\u0027re missing home Membenci jalan hanya saat kau rindu rumah Only know your lover when you\u0027ve let her go Mengenal kekasihmu hanya saat kau telah melepaskannya And you let her go Dan kau pun melepaskannya Staring at the ceiling in the dark Menatap langit-langit di dalam gelap Same old empty feeling in your heart Masih perasaan hampa yang sama di hatimu ‘Cause Love comes slow and it goes so fast Karena cinta datang pelan dan pergi begitu cepat Well you see her when you fall asleep Kau melihatnya saat kau tertidur But to never to touch and never to keep Tapi tak pernah menyentuh dan tak pernah miliki ‘Cause you loved her too much Karena kau terlalu mencintainya And you dive too deep Dan kau menyelam terlalu dalam Well you only need the light when it\u0027s burning low Kau butuh cahaya hanya saat gelap datang menjelang Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Rindukan mentari hanya di saat salju mulai turun Only know your lover when you let her go Mengenal kekasihmu hanya saat kau melepaskannya Only know you\u0027ve been high when you\u0027re feeling low Mengerti bahwa kau bahagia hanya saat kau sedang bersedih Only hate the road when you\u0027re missing home Membenci jalan hanya saat kau rindu rumah Only know your lover when you\u0027ve let her go Mengenal kekasihmu hanya saat kau telah melepaskannya And you let her go oh..ohh Dan kau melepaskannya And you let her go oh..ohh Dan kau pun melepaskannya Will you let her go Akankah kau melepaskannya ‘Cause you only need the light when it\u0027s burning low Karena kau butuh cahaya hanya saat gelap datang menjelang Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Rindukan mentari hanya di saat salju mulai turun Only know your lover when you let her go Mengenal kekasihmu hanya saat kau melepaskannya Only know you\u0027ve been high when you\u0027re feeling low Mengerti bahwa kau bahagia hanya saat kau sedang bersedih Only hate the road when you\u0027re missing home Membenci jalan hanya saat kau rindu rumah Only know your lover when you\u0027ve let her go Mengenal kekasihmu hanya saat kau telah melepaskannya ‘Cause you only need the light when it\u0027s burning low Karena kau butuh cahaya hanya saat gelap datang menjelang Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Rindukan mentari hanya di saat salju mulai turun Only know your lover when you let her go Mengenal kekasihmu hanya saat kau melepaskannya Only know you\u0027ve been high when you\u0027re feeling low Mengerti bahwa kau bahagia hanya saat kau sedang bersedih Only hate the road when you\u0027re missing home Membenci jalan hanya saat kau rindu rumah Only know your lover when you\u0027ve let her go Mengenal kekasihmu hanya saat kau telah melepaskannya And you let her go Dan kau pun melepaskannya",

  "My boyfriend of four years has a serious meth addiction. I tried talking with him about it, but he would become defensive and angry, accusing me of violating his trust whenever I discover the pipes or evidence. Last week, things came to a breaking point when he claimed his reason for using was because of me. I told him that all I’ve ever wanted is for him to be happy and healthy, and if that couldn’t happen with me, then he needed to go somewhere he could find that for himself. I asked him to leave—not because I wanted us to break up, but because I hoped it would push him to get the help he needs. He\u0027s gone now and that hasn\u0027t happened yet, but this song resonates with me now in ways it never did before. Letting go sometimes isn’t due to a lack of love, but because of it. If there are any believers out there, please pray for him. He needs it, and so do I. 💔",

  "To My Lost Love, Seventeen years have passed since we parted, yet not a day goes by without your essence lingering in my thoughts. I’ve achieved my dreams as a neurologist, and while wealth surrounds me, it cannot fill the void your absence has left in my heart. Our paths diverged due to financial struggles, forcing us to choose family over our love. I often reflect on the passionate moments we shared—the laughter, the dreams, and the unwavering support we offered each other. Those memories are a bittersweet reminder of the profound connection we once had. Despite my successes, I feel like a lost soul, grappling with shadows from my past and battling addiction. I write this not to disrupt your happiness, but to express the depth of my feelings—how your presence still echoes in my life. You were never just part of my past; you are a piece of my soul that I will carry forever. May we find our way back to each other in another lifetime, where nothing can keep us apart. Until then, I wish you love, joy, and all the happiness life can offer.",

I lived and fucked…fucked up along the way So that Time mattered With each falling grain of sand Here I still stand The same boy A man From the beginning to the coming END I stand alone Always on my own Stilling going…still going strong? I wish But  Slowing down Let me see The world as it is And believe me It is a beautiful world …just because I am Stranded…stuck In dirt I didn’t realize before So would you help me keep this candle lid? I asked again Thinking of you my friend Do you really understand Me  Even in the end No matter where we stand Opposite end of the chapter gone by Look who are now by your side How was that ride? Don’t lie Don’t fucking lie I see it in your eyes So why as why Because  How are we here We were just there Side by side But where are you Tonight So that we can say  Goodbye So forever can be right Justifying all my wrongs So that I can take flight Spread my broken wings and fly I fly with you I fly with you Through all of it again And again Again It will never end my friends",

  "This song reminds me of the one that got away,  Folks never let the good one get away, 25 yrs and it still hurts so bad, never make my mistake. trust me  it will haunt you to the grave. You get one maybe 2 chances at real love in a lifetime, do not piss it away.  I had 2  shots one I lost, the other I let go. I am older and will die always wondering how great my life would have been if only. I have had a good life, but I know it would have been better had i spent it with her. Please do not miss the chance, It will go to the grave with you. from an old man, do not let her slip away, you will regret it. If you love her do what ever it takes to keep her.",

  "Sometimes it’s good to let her go. Because you can’t let that person be with yourself if he or she makes mind to just go away from your life. Don’t be sad just enjoy and remember the memories and wait for the right person to get more than that what you have done for him/her. No doubt I loved her so much that the other person will not give that much in this life. I am that sure. I don’t want anything bad for you or don’t have any grudges.

  "This Song Helped Let Go Of  Im proud to say that this and this song, absolutely help and gain me on perspective life. I was doing time at prison for crimes when the woman of  life promised me everyday, that she would always be by my side thru out the entire ride, and would never leave me nomatter what. I wouldn’t have to worry about a thing she got going on,on the side. LISTEN , if someone is meant to be in your life GOD will show you the signs. I’ve loved multiple women trying to find misses right but only to get mentally abuse or treated like the lowest scum on the earth. Never feel that what you go thru and the treatment and abuse you endure is nots Gods plan for you😂 So when you ever feel down to the lowest point in life ad yor feeling doubt just know that somebody out there care.

The Holy Bible does not say that you have to pray to the virgin Mary and it does not say that you have to join a certain political party. The Holy Bible does not say you have to join Trumps Cult to go to Heaven If we don\u0027t stop Trump from becoming president again then we deserve to face the consequences. Those consequences will be worse than what happened at The Capitol. His Cult must be stopped. When Jesus was on this earth he lost a lot of followers because He refused to overthrow The Romans/Government In the name of His Father In Heaven. The Republican Party is all about overthrowing and taking over the government In The Name Of God. God does not approve. The Republican Party is all about forcing God down peoples throats.

Eu falei pra mim mesma que nunca ia deixar de amar aquele menino dos olhos e cabelos pretos, e eu não esqueci do que eu falei pra mim. Mas ele esqueceu, ou talvez não. Como pode a gente ter tanta certeza de algo e, de um dia pro outro, as coisas mudarem tanto? Às vezes, a gente não fica com o amor da nossa vida, e tá tudo bem. O tempo passa, tudo passa, mas meu coração é dele desde o dia que o conheci, desde a primeira vez que botei meus olhos nos olhos dele.

We ended up getting together and it seemed like it was going pretty good for the first couple months, then we got into an argument but it ended up working out she started showing less interest in me and less, and still going on to show me less. I don\u0027t know what to do at this point I feel as I\u0027m watching it fall but I want to save it but I don\u0027t think I can anymore I see the end near.

  "Almost 7 years ago, we had to “let her go” when we laid mom to rest. To this day, no one is fine. For most, life has went on yes…but my only full brother is gone at 27, and I also lost my dog of 14 years on the same day, and the same time, one year later from my brothers passing. Coincidence?  I’m not going to live past thanksgiving. My advice to you all? Keep shining, and never let her, or anyone go, without doing the best you can and always show them love. Always be willing to stay a few minutes longer. Always hug them, tell them how much they mean to you, and especially with pets, tell them how good they were and love on them. I am so very tired. With much love and warm regards,",

  "Moin, God Loves you and wants you to get saved! Jesus Christ is the only Way to Heaven! 1: Every human being has sinned and is guilty before God! (Romans 3:23),  2: Therefore, man deserves God\u0027s punishment for sin, i.e. a hell ---\u003e eternal absence of God (Revelation 21:8, Romans 6:23)  3: Man cannot pay his own debt and therefore needs God, who became man in Jesus Christ. Jesus did no sin in his life and was the SPOTLESS ATONING SACRIFICE who LOVED you and DIED on the cross for YOUR SINS and shed his BLOOD to save us. Jesus was then BURIED and ROSE AGAIN on the third day. (1 Corinthians 15:1-4, Romans 3:25, Ephesians 1:7, Hebrews 9:22) How are you saved?  1: Realize that you are a sinner in need of a Saviour 2: Turn away from trusting in your own works and turn to God by Faith 3: Believe and TRUST the finished work of Jesus and the BLOOD Jesus shed for you. (Romans 3:25, Ephesians 2:8-9, Ephesians 1:13)   Note: It is faith alone that saves, no single good deed (such as baptism, donations, etc.) can give you salvation or take it away. If you believe with all your heart what you have just read, confess it to God in this or a similar way :)  Dear God, I have realised that I am a sinner and need salvation. I repent and believe from my heart that the Lord Jesus Christ is God, that he died for my sins, was buried and rose again to save me from hell. Now I trust ONLY in the finished work on the cross and in the shed blood of Jesus, not in any of my good deeds. Thank you that I am now saved and accepted through Jesus. I now accept you Jesus as my Lord and Savior.  In Jesus\u0027 name, amen. Congratulations! You are now a child of God, the Holy Spirit lives in you and God has forgiven you. This is just the beginning of an eternity with Jesus.  Other important verses on assurance of salvation: John 1:12, Galatians 3:26, John 10:27-30, 1 John 5:13, Ephesians 1:13  God bless you!",

One of them and I are now taking the final exams for college admission. One of them failed the college entrance exam and is now starting to study again. One of them got married and one of them was transferred to another school. The five of us are no longer together. This song reminds me of them. I really miss them and my days with them.

  "Sadness and Psychological disorders: 1.Psychological Weakness: Being affected by others\u0027 actions and questioning why they behave in certain ways, which leads to discomfort and sadness. No one should have the power to upset or sadden you; you are the one who allows yourself to be upset. 2.Failure to Express Inner Feelings: If there is something troubling or critical inside, communicate it calmly without seeking revenge or expecting an apology. An apology is a positive outcome, but not a necessity. 3.Illusions from Childhood: Growing up with the belief that life is like cartoons—easy, loving, and problem-free—leads to shock when facing the real difficulties of adult life. 4.Ignorance of the Self: Not understanding one\u0027s own nature (who am I and why was I created). This includes ignorance of general human conditions (e.g., weakness, pride, ignorance, injustice, arguing, despair, etc.) and personal self-awareness (personal history, personality, and how past experiences shaped who you are). It is important to recognize and address these attributes and traits to deal with others in a truthful, patient, and compassionate manner. 5.Fear Due to Ignorance: Ignorance can lead to fear, which can spiral into obsessive-compulsive disorder and eventually anxiety and depression. 6.Pathological Attachment to People or Things 7.Overemphasis on Negative Criticism from Others: If people criticize you negatively, they might be envious or attempting to undermine you rather than offering constructive advice. You are not defined by others\u0027 opinions. 8.Expecting the Worst: Anticipating negative outcomes in people\u0027s behavior and life\u0027s events can lead to a more manageable experience when the worst doesn\u0027t happen. For instance, expecting traffic congestion or personal loss helps in coping better when these events occur. 9.Ingratitude for Blessings: Failing to appreciate the blessings you have and focusing on what others possess can lead to dissatisfaction. It is important to recognize and be grateful for the blessings God has granted you.",

Her bag was found nearby her house after some search. Everyone is in trauma and no body knows where is she.  She is our lovely cousin. She never told anyone about her problems what she is going through. She dealt all  problems by herself. She is in 10 grade and around 16 yrs old.  An FIR has been registered for her missing and police party is performing their duties and ensured that she will be traced  as soon as possible. We are hoping and praying to God for her safety and life. Please come back ……",

  "It\u0027s been more than 10 years, still feels like yesterday. She was the first friend i made in school stick together for 4 years; that was so magical; after that she left school, as we were just 12  Y.O. i missed her..  I didn\u0027t understand emotions that time so i thought maybe i\u0027m missing her; as  time flies i later on realized i love her and kept waiting for her. found her after 7 years  (after highschool).  she  totally forgot me and i  was still stuck in that  time.  Did my best to build that friendship again,  which i got success in that. But later on got to know that she is already in a  relationship, and the guy was getting insecure cause of me, so she asked help to help him understand as i know him from my coaching classes. The Emotions i had for her clearly gave me a shock inside but i valued her smile more than what i feel. I helped her to fix her bond with him while carrying immense pain but i never showed it to her.  Now  in present they got engaged or might got married;  I\u0027m no longer in touch with her.  And I still love her  :)). Now I\u0027m 29 and I\u0027m still in those magical  moments. Only this song gives that memory and me a bit of peace.!!",

  "The Art of letting Go For a long time I feared loosing you.  The thought of never having you by my side scared me. I look at how things are now.  I never imagined this moment. But I realised that holding on you was only killing me slowly , and letting go was one of the best things I could have done.  I’ve learned that loving you was one of the best mistake I made , with no regret .  I appreciate moments we both took for granted . The lack of appreciation only makes me appreciate the small moments we shared.  I loved you and I will never forget you or the memories we made . I simply realize that I never want to love like that again. You are suppose to support and appreciate one another not take them for granted, appreciate the love . My road to my happiness started the moment I let go ….            @words.by.adi_",

  "That happen about 24th March 2021. After so many times I have tried to start any relationship with a girl - that time I thought I finally found my dream one. I had a crush on her for almost two years, carefully taking steps and not doing anything too quick. Giving her time to know each other well. I was really impressed by her - she was pretty (maybe not ultra-cute but at least pretty), very intelligent, very caring. I enjoyed every little time I was spending with her - because we lived in different cities plus my job involved me to travel on regular basis so I couldn\u0027t see her very often. She didn\u0027t want to accept me to be my Facebook friend even just to stay in touch - she laid me by saying she hasn\u0027t got an account. Finally on the day above I bought her flowers and visited her. She said: \"I will not take them. I have boyfriend...\"  My whole world broke in two. A part of my mind told me to stay calm, leave the place, going somewhere and chill. I bought whisky and some beer and got back home hours later. I cried. I drunk half of Johnny Walker almost at once listening to heart-breaking songs (including this one). Some time later that evening I found her Facebook and Instagram profiles. Indeed, she had a boyfriend. And they have already been together for years. She was 22 that day. I started overthinking: \"She was 16 when they got together... She might have kissed him thousends times... He might have f#cked her - if not thousends, then at least hundreds times. You talked to her on the day when a night before her little innocent lips might had his eqiupment inside... And they might done it time after time and days before you even saw her for the first time... They are so much experienced while being much younger than you - and you\u0027re still waiting for your FIRST girlfriend. Of course, not just sit and wait - you take any actions, any steps but they give you nothing in return. They are young and experienced and you\u0027re old (38 yrs) and unexperienced - just because you wanted to stay honest and to ensure the girl you meet will be your first one. In other words - you didn\u0027t want to behave like male-wh#re and to proceed with anybody. You wanted to give your first girlfriend the best you can give - to let her be your everything! And now... you feel cheated. You feel rubbish. You feel worthless...\". I still keep some photos I downloaded from her socials that evening. In the meantime she changed her work and now living in other city. I know exactly where - but I don\u0027t think if I want to visit her.  I don\u0027t even think if I want to be in any relationship now. I don\u0027t think if I want to know anybody new. Every day I pass so many girls and young women but NO ONE meets my requirements. I don\u0027t see anybody I can easily like. I don\u0027t see anybody worth my time and effort.  Something died inside of me. The girl I talked about above was the last one I took effort to know. I got rejected and now - I just... cannot! Cannot do anything on this field.  Something died inside of me... And it seems there is no cure for it.  Why? Because... I STARTED REJECTING any help, any cures.  I have always believed that I will find someone.  But now... I don\u0027t want to believe. I want NOT TO BELIEVE...",

  "OKAY , As for the request , i will give you a enchanted love story  The Ballad of the Enchanted Lyric” In a quaint village nestled amidst ancient oaks, there lived a young bard named Elowen. Her heart, like parchment, bore the ink of countless tales. But it was her own love story that danced across her soul—a melody both haunting and hopeful. Elowen’s love bloomed in the shadow of an old stone bridge, where moonlight painted ripples on the river’s surface. There, she met Lysander, a mysterious traveler with eyes like forgotten constellations. His voice held secrets—whispers of forgotten realms and promises unspoken. Hope that you understood. To know full story , give a love symbol with the name of ones you lobe very much ( It can be also a part of your family ).  - Vishvajit",
  "Let\u0027s describe this song  The lyrics of the song are poetic and melancholic, describing the regrets associated with ending a relationship. The chorus describes situations in which one does not appreciate what he or she has until it is gone, and relates this to love. Hope you understand  -Vishvajit",

  "My beloved ones in humanity💕           When we are children, we learn from our parents many habits that over time become like instinct, because the child is naturally associated with emotion.          They may do bad things, such as bias in their love for their children, which reflects the problems of the siblings when they grow up.          Emotions make mistakes.          I assure you that it is impossible to be free from the thoughts and customs of your parents because they are attached to your memory, but it is possible to control them, including their religion.          If there is someone who immigrated to another country far from his family and changed his religion and gave birth to a child, then he follows the new religion of his father.          What is this false principle?          This is the greatest evidence that God created for you a treasure of mind and heart so that we may know our Creator and the heavenly books.          We were not with them when I wrote, and may God judge between us.          Do a complete fast for ten days until sunset and go to the temple and imagine that you will die soon and do the same thing again and go to the mosque.          It is a simple matter of learning to pray.          In the language you speak, it is possible.          You will see where tranquility, tranquility and spiritual happiness are in a sound heart and that they come directly from God           If you want to benefit, follow all my posts         You must search for the truth yourself.

  "And u only need the light when it\u0027s burning low, only miss the sun when it starts to snow, only know u love her when u let her go oh no you\u0027ve been high in feeling low only hate the road when your mission home only know u love her when u let her go And u let her go. solo 1 starring at the bottom of the glass, hoping one day you make a dream last, dreams come slow but it comes so fast, you see when u close your eye, maybe oneday u\u0027ll understand why, everything u touch surely dies. But u only need the light when it\u0027s burning low, only miss the sun when it starts to snow, only know u love her and u let her go oh no you\u0027ve been high in feeling low only hate the road when ur missing home only know u love her when u let her go. solo 2 starring at the scene in the dark seeing all empty feel in your heart cause love comes slow and it goes so fast what u see when u fall asleep, never to touch her, never to pick call the love too much and you gat to deal with it. when u only need the light when it\u0027s burning low, only miss the sun when it starts to snow, only know you love her when u let her go oh no you\u0027ve been high in feeling low only hate the road when your missing home only know u love her when u let her go. And u let her go uh uh uh uh uh uh uh and u let her go uh uh uh uh uh uh uh will u let her go uh uh cause u only need the light when it\u0027s burning low o, only miss the sun when it starts to snow,only know you love her when u let her go. oh no u feel high in feeling low only hate the road when your missing home only know u love her when u let her go.",

The war came and we went out to all countries of the world as displaced persons, refugees and expatriates.  All the construction of the universe and all the beauty of the world around us did not compensate us for an ordinary moment in our country.

  "Anyone after 11 year  (me 29 june 2024)??",
  "Bueno vengo a sacar todo lo que siento por esa persona. La conocí exactamente durante la época de pandemia, yo era su mayor, nos conocimos mediante un juego online en esos tiempos conocidos. Exactamente coincidimos de la nada y empezamos a jugar, yo le agarre cariño ya que me gustaba enseñarle poco a poco como se jugaba y ella se dejaba enseñar :) No se como pero empezamos a jugar varios juegos online y éramos como pareja online, recuerdo que en navidad nos dijimos palabras bonitas y en año nuevo yo con mis amigos fuimos a una fiesta a tomar y con el trago le dije que me gustaba y todo eso , cosa que era cierto pero no me atrevía por miedo al rechazo, a ella le sorprendió , yo saliendo del trabajo le dije lo que sentía por ella ya que antes de eso ella me mandaba videos de tik tok que hacia, yo igual , hacíamos llamada, videollamada etc. El día 04 de enero del 2021 le dije para tener una relacion así a distancia ,  que íbamos a intentarlo y así paso nuestra relación , y le prometí que viajaría para ir a verla ... ah verdad yo era de lima y ella de Piura. Bueno yo soy un poco pegado a mis padres, cuando les dije que iría de viaje les mentí diciendo que iría con unos amigos a ir a las playas de Piura,etc pero en realidad le sorprendí que iría a verla a ella, si por primera vez encontrármela, fue hermoso y a la vez me dio miedo por saber si de verdad era esa persona o no. Ella fue con su hermana mayor y nos vimos, fue un momento bonito , no les miento primera vez que nos dimos un beso ,nos dimos la mano,etc. Me fui de viaje 10 días exacto, en esos días conocí a su familia, en ese tiempo nosotros 2 tuvimos intimidad cosa que es normal en una pareja, fue hermoso :) Pero cuando me fui de Piura le dije que volvería y así fue, volví después de 6 meses ya que en ese tiempo me dieron vacaciones pero está vez fueron 7 dias para verla , como les dije hice todo lo que pude para verla otra vez, y fue hermoso también. Después le propuse que ella viajara a Lima a visitarme o capaz quedarse por allá ya que ahí hay mas oportunidades que en donde ella vivía, por que ella era de Paita y Sechura un lugar de pocos recursos a diferencia de la ciudad de Piura. Pero su respuesta siempre fue que no podía por que aun no tenia la edad, que sus padres que tenia miedo y no la culpo y desde ahi empezaron los problemas. 1ero (SU FAMILIA) su madre , tanto su hermana mayor me empezaron a pedir plata prestado, comenzaron con 50 soles , cosa que es dable, luego fueron 150, 200, 300, 500, y yo habré estado ciego que les prestaba , y lo peor es que para que me paguen yo tenia que hacerles acordar, no les miento para pagarme 500 se demoraron meses, de ahi un dia me dijieron que tenian una urgencia su madre,etc y me pidio que le preste 1300 si no me equivoco y yo le presté. pero esos 1300 se demoraron un ciclo hasta rogarles cosa que solo me dieron 700 y eso mintiendo diciendo que mi familia estaba mal etc. De ahi una llamada me da su madre desesperada diciendo que yo me haga un préstamo de 3000 soles que ella lo iba a pagar, pero que lo saque y se me hizo raro ,yo le dije que con el dolor de mi corazon no podia, uno por que aun no me pagaban la plata que me debian y otro se me hacia raro que cada vez que querían pagarme, les pasaba algo, que su hija estaba mal, que les robaban,etc. Hasta que unian a panderos que no se si de verdad existian o no pero yo le entraba. 2do(SU FALTA DE AMBICION) Ella era quedad, no queria trabajar , siempre decia que su papá les daba todo y literal sus hermanas y su madre no trabajaban, me daba pena el señor, siendo taxista cubria el gasto de todas, eran(6 mujeres ahi) eso que no cuento a sus abuelos y la mayor tenia una hija que su padre la abandonó, y literal ellos querían que les diera plata yo y a aveces entiendo al padre de la pequeña que lo abandonó , la hermana mayor era un caso perdido. Yo tuve que buscarle trabajo desde Lima a Piura , en un restaurante y así rogandola ella entró. 3ero(CAMBIE DE TRABAJO) yo trabajaba feliz en un almacén con mis amigos bacán, todo ahi pero yo sabia que ya tenia que cambiar de aires y fue donde busqué un trabajo donde tenga contacto con los clientes y eso fue, me convertí en MERCADERISTA, no se si conocen en PLAZA VEA PERSONAL EXTERNO. Fue donde conocí a muchas personas increíbles de verdad , pero mi debilidad fueron mis compañeras que tenían otras intenciones. Comencé a sentir cariño por una chica que era mucho mayor que yo, no sabia que tenia 3 hijos pero le tuve cariño, no me enamoré , pero si cariño , le acompañaba en las salidas, por ahi nos abrazábamos y ya. En una salida que ella tuvo con las compañeras yo la recogí y ella estaba mareada y yo también pq estaba con mis amigos en otro lado y así de mareados nos fuimos a otro lugar y pasó. Me sentí mal por la chica que vivía en Piura pero no venia interés de ella de superarse pero mi error fue no decirle TERMINAMOS nada, solo dejé fluir todo lo que pasaba en LIMA , de ahi pasaron cosas con ella pero solo 1 vez , lo de salir no podiamos por que ella tenia una familia y yo me sentía mal por que tampoco queria cortar su relacion, ella me contó que accedio conmigo pq sabia que su pareja tambien le hacia infiel y bueno no me sentí mal en ese momento pero si por la chica de PIURA.",

  "Well you only need the light when it\u0027s burning low Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Only know you love her when you let her go Only know you\u0027ve been high when you\u0027re feeling low Only hate the road when you\u0027re missing home Only know you love her when you let her go And you let her go Staring at the bottom of your glass Hoping one day you\u0027ll make a dream last But dreams come slow and they go so fast You see her when you close your eyes Maybe one day you\u0027ll understand why Everything you touch surely dies But you only need the light when it\u0027s burning low Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Only know you love her when you let her go Only know you\u0027ve been high when you\u0027re feeling low Only hate the road when you\u0027re missing home Only know you love her when you let her go Staring at the ceiling in the dark Same old empty feeling in your heart \u0027Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast Well you see her when you fall asleep But never to touch and never to keep \u0027Cause you loved her too much and you dive too deep Well you only need the light when it\u0027s burning low Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Only know you love her when you let her go Only know you\u0027ve been high when you\u0027re feeling low Only hate the road when you\u0027re missing home Only know you love her when you let her go And you let her go Oh oh oh no And you let her go Oh oh oh no Well you let her go \u0027Cause you only need the light when it\u0027s burning low Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Only know you love her when you let her go Only know you\u0027ve been high when you\u0027re feeling low Only hate the road when you\u0027re missing home Only know you love her when you let her go \u0027Cause you only need the light when it\u0027s burning low Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Only know you love her when you let her go Only know you\u0027ve been high when you\u0027re feeling low Only hate the road when you\u0027re missing home Only know you love her when you let her go And you let her go",

I don\u0027t know where you will end up, but please, never stop smiling and always be happy. It\u0027s my first time expressing my feelings to someone.

  "The singer purposely caused his loss. Not by accident, or mistake, but because he wanted it. This type of regret is different as the brokenhearted are usually the ones who get dumped, not the other way around. This is unusual as people don’t typically let go of something they want. Unless it’s for something they perceive is better. As much as I love this song, I can’t relate to the lyrics fully since I thankfully never put anything above love. Maybe it set me back a little in life but I don’t regret always putting love first. Had my heart broken a few times, and surely cause a few heartbreaks as well, but when the right one appeared it was so easy to put us first. This song hits me hard thinking about all the times I could have screwed it up, potentially losing the best thing that ever happened to me.",

  "Dear user, I’m not sure if anyone will actually see this. But I would like it to be out there, even if no one gives a crap. I have Cancer, and I’m most likely not surviving it. I would like to just let anyone know that I have never during my whole life been at more peace then right now. I have already come to the conclusion that my time here in this world is coming to an end, and there is nothing I can do about it.I would like you to all know what I have been figuring out over the past year. Live life to the fullest. Enjoy your time alone, cherish time with the ones you love. Be bored. Don’t always find something to do, and complain that your schedule is full. Times are tough, but so are you. Don’t be afraid of rejection. I met the girl of my dreams, we dated for three years, I was going to propose, but I was scared of her saying no. She eventually moved on, and is now happily married to someone else. Take the chances, you’re given. As Cody Johnson said, “if you’ve got a chance take it. Take it while you’ve got a chance. If you’ve got a dream, chase it, cuz the dream won’t chase you back” Also, times change. It’s just how it works. Don’t be sour about it. You can’t reverse time, so don’t dwell on the past.  I hope you found some meaning in my words. If you read all of that, I thank you. I will be gone soon, so I just needed somewhere to put my words out. Thank you, user, for choosing to read my message. I hope to see you wonderful people in the afterlife. ❤",

Normal eh. Normal....😂 Mas di ko kaya kung bigla nalang magbabago un kasi nafall ako sayo.hindi lang ako nafall, noon pa lang mahal na kita. Mahal na mahal lalo ngayon. Pero sa huli sa dulo o kahit umabot pa sa mahalin mo din ako pabalik, lagi parin kita ilelet go pag mahanap o marealize mo na sa iba ka pala sasaya o tunay na itinakda. Nagconfess ako sayo 2024 ng feelings hahahah. good thing we both choose to keep the friendship kasi dun naman talaga tau magtatagal. Inlove with you since 2007. I do not know to unlove a good soul. To the person who matches my energy, i love you. To the one who made me laugh to death, i miss you. To the one who can never be mine, i am here and will still be here keeping our friendship and will surely pray for you always. I love you and will always choose to support you kung kanino ka sasaya. I\u0027m good at being a friend, makikicontest ako sa mga kaibigan mo para makuha ko spot ng BESTFRIEND tittle sa buhay mo. 😂😅 Right now im so inlove talaga sayo pero itatago ko to gaya ng pagtatago ko since 2007 hahahah. Tanggal angas ko hahahah. nanahimik nako eh tapos dahil sa cake na un, gumulo and mundo ko at ang puso ko na nagpakaangas the whole time not to fall or believe in love.Sayo lang ako nag confess ng feelings, di ko na talaga uulitin. Ayaw ko naman tlaga magmahal. I will just love you in private and swear to be a loyal and trusted friend to you. Sa pagkakaibigan natin dun ko gagalingan. Ayaw ko na sumugal, tama na ung isa, talo man atleast nagtry. Ayaw ko isugal ung pagkakaibigan natin at ipilit na ligawan ka, baka kaibigan lang tlaga turing mo sakin mauwi sa FO pa hahaha.. Wala na..wala na talaga, di nako magmamahal, di ko din kaya magmahal ng panibagong tao na kikilalanin ko pa o pakikisamahan pa..stop na sa love. 2024 retired in love. Nameet ko na ang 1st love Nameet ko na greatest love At ikaw na unexpected love ko, babye!

  "Hey you! Yes, you, sitting behind your screen reading this. Note I know and you certainly don\u0027t know me. But I want to tell you something. Each one has its own story. Yours could be full of joy and happiness. Or it could be clouded with pain and misfortune. I want you to know that you are a beautiful, wonderful, talented person. Even if your life isn\u0027t going the way you want right now I know you can turn out okay. I want you to do me a favor. I know I\u0027m just a stranger, but trust me, okay? Every time you see your reflection, whether in the mirror, in the bathroom, in a window somewhere, or in a puddle on the street, I want you to look at yourself and give yourself a hug. Because even if you\u0027re not the prettiest, the smartest, or the funniest, you are something no one else can be: you. And you are the best you can be. Smile at strangers. Believe in yourself. Cry when you feel like crying, laugh when you want to laugh. Treat yourself like a god/goddess because you deserve it. Raise your head and keep your heart open. You are worth everything and then some. And always remember no matter what happens, even if it doesn\u0027t seem like it to you, you are everything to someone.❤️ 🏻",

Only know you’ve been high      When you’re feeling low,      Only hate the road      When you’re missing home,      Only know you love her      When you let her go,      And you let her go. Staring at the bottom of your glass, Hoping one day you’ll make a dream last, But dreams come slow And they go so fast. You see her when you close your eyes, Maybe one day you’ll understand why Everything you touch surely dies. Chorus:      But you only need the light      When it’s burning low,      Only miss the sun      When it starts to snow,      Only know you love her      When you let her go.      Only know you’ve been high      When you’re feeling low,      Only hate the road      When you’re missing home,      Only know you love her      When you let her go. Staring at the ceiling in the dark, Same old empty feeling in your heart, ’Cause love comes slow And it goes so fast. Well you see her when you fall asleep, But never to touch and never to keep, ’Cause you loved her too much And you dived too deep. Chorus:      But you only need the light      When it’s burning low,      Only miss the sun      When it starts to snow,      Only know you love her      When you let her go.      Only know you’ve been high      When you’re feeling low,      Only hate the road      When you’re missing home,      Only know you love her      When you let her go.      And you let her go,      And you let her go,      Well, you let her go.      ’Cause you only need the light      When it’s burning low,      Only miss the sun      When it starts to snow,      Only know you love her      When you let her go.      Only know you’ve been high      When you’re feeling low,      Only hate the road      When you’re missing home,      Only know you love her      When you let her go.      ’Cause you only need the light      When it’s burning low,      Only miss the sun      When it starts to snow,      Only know you love her      When you let her go.      Only know you’ve been high      When you’re feeling low,      Only hate the road      When you’re missing home,      Only know you love her      When you let her go,      And you let her go",

Usually, I am the daughter who remembers and celebrates all the family’s birthdays. No one remembers my birthday unless I tell them.

Her needs became my priority, and I was no longer angry, didn\u0027t fight, and hated how I had treated her and everyone else in my life.    Almost a year later, she admitted that she couldn\u0027t trust me despite seeing my change.   So, she left because in fixing me, she broke herself  and didn\u0027t like who she had become.    I know it seems obvious, but don\u0027t do what I did.  Change before it\u0027s too late, and you break the best person you ever met; who made you want to be better.",

Better to let her go now i guess... If only i acted sooner",

I recently started feeling sentiments towards her but i figured out she was already with someone, although I could still see in her eyes she was in love with me. I insisted about taking her to dates. But i couldn\u0027t unsee the undecision in her actions. Today we\u0027ve spent a beatiful day together. Went at the restaurant, ate pizzas and talked for hours, but i couldn\u0027t take it. I couldn\u0027t condone myself trying to take someone\u0027s person just out of her undecision. I told her by call i would want to let her go. I couldn\u0027t hold her undecision and i would ease her the way. She thanked me. I directly came watching this song... perplexed.",

  "one time a few years ago i had a giant container of coconut oil that i kept in my room. i used it as a hair mask, moisturizer, etc. anyways summer came along and the days grew hotter. the coconut oil completely liquified in the jar. this was fine, it was going to melt before it went in my hair anyway. i began to reach into the jar, pulling out handfuls of liquid oil to slather on my scalp. foolishly, stupidly, in a way not unlike icarus, i picked the jar up to balance it on my leg. my hands were too slippery. there was no grip. it fell from my grasp and hit my carpet before i had any time to react or prepare. the entire jar (a large jar) soaked into my carpet. i had no idea what to do. still in shock from the weight of my experience i did the only thing i could think of. i dried my hands on my shirt (it was also not spared on that tragic day) and grabbed my phone and played this song as loud as i could. i lay there on the floor beside the massive oil spill i’d created in the fetal position until the song concluded, thinking only of what was lost as a direct result of my own hubris, and of the mortal sin i’d just committed. then i got up to go get paper towels.",

  "Tradução letra: Bem, você só precisa da luz quando está escurecendo Só sente falta do Sol quando começa a nevar Só sabe que a ama quando a deixa ir Só sabe que estava bem quando se sente mal Só odeia a estrada quando sente saudade de casa Só sabe que a ama quando a deixa ir E você a deixou ir Olhando para o fundo do seu copo Esperando que um dia você faça um sonho durar Mas sonhos vêm devagar e se vão muito rápido Você a vê quando fecha seus olhos Talvez um dia você entenda o porquê Tudo que você toca certamente morre Mas você só precisa da luz quando está escurecendo Só sente falta do Sol quando começa a nevar Só sabe que a ama quando a deixa ir Só sabe que estava bem quando se sente mal Só odeia a estrada quando sente saudade de casa Só sabe que a ama quando a deixa ir Encarando o teto no escuro O mesmo velho sentimento de vazio em seu coração Porque o amor vem devagar e se vai muito rápido Bem, você a vê quando adormece Mas nunca consegue tocá-la e nem mantê-la por perto Porque você a amava muito e foi muito intenso Bem, você só precisa da luz quando está escurecendo Só sente falta do Sol quando começa a nevar Só sabe que a ama quando a deixa ir Só sabe que estava bem quando se sente mal Só odeia a estrada quando sente saudade de casa Só sabe que a ama quando a deixa ir E você a deixou ir Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh E você a deixou ir Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh Quando você a deixou ir Whoa Porque você só precisa da luz quando está escurecendo Só sente falta do Sol quando começa a nevar Só sabe que a ama quando a deixa ir Só sabe que estava bem quando se sente mal Só odeia a estrada quando sente saudade de casa Só sabe que a ama quando a deixa ir Porque você só precisa da luz quando está escurecendo Só sente falta do Sol quando começa a nevar Só sabe que a ama quando a deixa ir Só sabe que estava bem quando se sente mal Só odeia a estrada quando sente saudade de casa Só sabe que a ama quando a deixa ir E você a deixou ir",
