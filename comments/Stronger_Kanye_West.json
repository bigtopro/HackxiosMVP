  "To address poverty, Dr. Olukoya suggests praying for the \"anointing of ease,\" which can make difficult tasks easier and progress faster. This anointing can bring solutions to problems, make for sweatless victory, and even turn hardship into ease, leading to effortless promotion. Prayers should focus on dismantling the spirit of poverty, breaking chains of failure, and claiming prosperity, including deliverance from inherited poverty.  Here\u0027s a breakdown of prayer points based on Dr. Olukoya\u0027s teachings: 1. Pray for the \"Anointing of Ease\": Ask God to release the anointing of ease upon your life, making difficult tasks easier and progress faster. Daniel Templeton it\u0027s Grace and GM for J.Jiminez.",

Specific prayer points and themes include: Breaking the Spirit of Poverty: Pray against the spirit of poverty, its influence, and its manifestations in one\u0027s life.  Destroying Altars of Poverty: Target and destroy any spiritual altars that perpetuate poverty.

Releasing Blessings: Pray for God\u0027s blessings to come upon you and overtake you.  Releasing the Anointing of Ease: Pray for the anointing that makes difficult things easy, and progress inevitable.  Claiming Sudden Increase and Dramatic Changes: Pray for sudden and dramatic financial increase in your life.  The four finger",

  "The Story of Raymond: A Tale of Redemption and Understanding   In this alternate reality, stories aren\u0027t just entertainment—they are lifelines. They are tools to work through the deep, tangled roots of **Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD)**. The story of Raymond is one such tale, a narrative woven with pain, redemption, and the struggle to break free from cycles of harm. --- ### **Raymond\u0027s Beginning**   Raymond grew up in a world where power and control were mistaken for love. His father, a man of domineering faith, led their community with an iron fist masked as divine authority. Raymond learned early that to survive, he had to conform, suppress, and follow the oppressive doctrines passed down to him.   But in the quiet corners of his mind, he dreamed of a different world—one where love wasn\u0027t conditional, where faith wasn\u0027t fear, and where he could be more than the shadow of his father.   --- ### **The Pastor’s Son Becomes the Pastor**   As time went on, Raymond inherited his father\u0027s role as pastor, stepping into shoes he had once feared. He thought he could bring change, but the weight of tradition, expectation, and unhealed wounds bore down on him.   He became the very thing he had despised—a leader who wielded power to control, a father who demanded obedience, a man who mistook fear for respect. **Raymond had become his father.** --- ### **The Breaking Point**   One day, Raymond\u0027s youngest son, Samuel, quietly asked him, \"Why do you make me feel small, Dad?\" The question echoed in Raymond\u0027s mind, piercing through the walls he had built around his heart.   He began to see the cycle—the pain he had endured as a child, the ways it had shaped him, and how he was now passing that same pain to his own children. For the first time, Raymond confronted the truth: **he was both a victim and a perpetrator of generational trauma.** --- ### **The Journey of Redemption**   Raymond didn’t know how to heal, but he knew he had to try. He turned to the one thing he had always known—stories.   In this reality, stories were more than just words on a page; they were shared experiences, collective truths, and pathways to understanding. Raymond began to write his story, piece by piece, unraveling the threads of his past:   - The fear he felt as a child under his father’s rule.   - The shame of becoming the very thing he hated.   - The desire to be different, better, for his children.   Through writing, Raymond began to see himself not as a monster, but as a man shaped by pain, longing to break free.   --- ### **Rebuilding Relationships**   As Raymond worked through his story, he shared it with his son Samuel. At first, Samuel was angry—angry that his father had hurt him, angry that it had taken so long for him to see the truth. But as the story unfolded, Samuel began to see his father with new eyes.   They began to write a new story together—one of forgiveness, understanding, and healing. It wasn’t easy, but with each chapter, they built a bridge over the pain that had once divided them.   --- ### **The Legacy of Change**   Raymond\u0027s story became a beacon for others in their community. People who had suffered in silence began to share their own stories, using narrative as a way to process their pain and heal.   Raymond realized that while he couldn’t change the past, he could help others change their futures. His story—and the stories of those around him—became a testament to the power of vulnerability, connection, and the courage to face the truth.   --- #### **Conclusion**   The story of Raymond is one of breaking cycles, of facing the darkest parts of ourselves to create light for others. In this alternate reality, where stories are the vehicle for healing, Raymond’s journey reminds us that it’s never too late to change, to heal, and to rewrite our own narratives.   Would you like to expand on this story or explore another character\u0027s perspective within this reality? Let\u0027s keep building!",

  "How has it been almost 20 years since this song has came out. It is still a banger even in 2025. Kanye West is definitely one of the best rappers in the world.",
  "My theory is that after Kayne mother died, he fell into depression and started using Nitrus or other drugs to cope. The drugs destroyed his brain beyond repair and he starting watching right-wing propaganda that was everywhere in 2016. Dude fell into the right-wing conspiracy pipeline and became the N@zi supporter Nitrus addicted that we all know now..... And the saddest part is that after he stop being useful for them, they will just turn him into a target for the race debate for being black... How far he have fallen.....",

It was inappropriate timing and the Bishop, well she could have waited until the next service to address those issues, and I believe the LGBTQ would have understood.  This was this Bishop\u0027s agenda, and she should apologise to President Trump.  President Trump would have dealt with these issues at another time, or service or at an appointment with him.   A prayer service on that day was in my opinion not at all appropriate or necessary to bring this up.  With what is going on around this world right now in real time, to single out one collective group of people, to show support for only them, and, not anyone else feeling the fear and fright and terror that life altering changes create for everyone, not just a select few. President Trump is the strong correction on all this weak woke passive- aggressive intolerable insipid non resilient people who need to toughen up and get real with themselves first.

  "I can’t believe this song is already 18 years old. I vividly remember hearing Stronger for the first time in 2007 on commercial radio stations while I was in the back of my parents cars during drives at 7/8 years old as if it were yesterday.  The song itself reminds me of some of the many places I’d been and some other memories I have from ‘07, which have clearly come to be known as ‘simpler times’ for someone such as myself. I won’t go the extreme by saying that I ever looked up to Kanye as an individual during his rise to peak fame, (and especially now) mainly because I was too young around that time, and didn’t rediscover him until I was 15/16 during the life of Pablo era.  But as I was able to actively listen and understand a bit more about him as I got older, I was (and even more so today) genuinely inspired and appreciative of Kanye’s gift for sampling and inherent creativity when it came to making music like this, which was clearly so far ahead of it’s time. 808’s and heartbreak will forever be my number 1 favourite album ever, and listening to this song right now is so bittersweet for me, reminding me that things just aren’t the same as they were once upon a time ago.  Listening to stronger with everything that’s going on with Kanye now makes me feel a little bit sad. I wish that he could still be producing this kind of music today, but I guess some things are worth smiling about because they happened, and we were there to experience it.  Nostalgia is a gift and a curse 💔",

  "❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Isaiah 40 New International Version Comfort for God’s People 40 Comfort, comfort my people,     says your God. 2 Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,     and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed,     that her sin has been paid for, that she has received from the Lord’s hand     double for all her sins. 3 A voice of one calling: “In the wilderness prepare     the way for the Lord[a]; make straight in the desert     a highway for our God.[b] 4 Every valley shall be raised up,     every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level,     the rugged places a plain. 5 And the glory of the Lord will be revealed,     and all people will see it together. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.” 6 A voice says, “Cry out.”     And I said, “What shall I cry?” “All people are like grass,     and all their faithfulness is like the flowers of the field. 7 The grass withers and the flowers fall,     because the breath of the Lord blows on them.     Surely the people are grass. 8 The grass withers and the flowers fall,     but the word of our God endures forever.” 9 You who bring good news to Zion,     go up on a high mountain. You who bring good news to Jerusalem,[c]     lift up your voice with a shout, lift it up, do not be afraid;     say to the towns of Judah,     “Here is your God!” 10 See, the Sovereign Lord comes with power,     and he rules with a mighty arm. See, his reward is with him,     and his recompense accompanies him. 11 He tends his flock like a shepherd:     He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart;     he gently leads those that have young. 12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,     or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket,     or weighed the mountains on the scales     and the hills in a balance? 13 Who can fathom the Spirit[d] of the Lord,     or instruct the Lord as his counselor? 14 Whom did the Lord consult to enlighten him,     and who taught him the right way? Who was it that taught him knowledge,     or showed him the path of understanding? 15 Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket;     they are regarded as dust on the scales;     he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust. 16 Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires,     nor its animals enough for burnt offerings. 17 Before him all the nations are as nothing;     they are regarded by him as worthless     and less than nothing. 18 With whom, then, will you compare God?     To what image will you liken him? 19 As for an idol, a metalworker casts it,     and a goldsmith overlays it with gold     and fashions silver chains for it. 20 A person too poor to present such an offering     selects wood that will not rot; they look for a skilled worker     to set up an idol that will not topple. 21 Do you not know?     Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning?     Have you not understood since the earth was founded? 22 He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth,     and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy,     and spreads them out like a tent to live in. 23 He brings princes to naught     and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing. 24 No sooner are they planted,     no sooner are they sown,     no sooner do they take root in the ground, than he blows on them and they wither,     and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff. 25 “To whom will you compare me?     Or who is my equal?” says the Holy One. 26 Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens:     Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one     and calls forth each of them by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength,     not one of them is missing. 27 Why do you complain, Jacob?     Why do you say, Israel, “My way is hidden from the Lord;     my cause is disregarded by my God”? 28 Do you not know?     Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God,     the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary,     and his understanding no one can fathom. 29 He gives strength to the weary     and increases the power of the weak. 30 Even youths grow tired and weary,     and young men stumble and fall; 31 but those who hope in the Lord     will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles;     they will run and not grow weary,     they will walk and not be faint.",
  "❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ John 14 New International Version Jesus Comforts His Disciples 14 “Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God[a]; believe also in me. 2 My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. 4 You know the way to the place where I am going.” Jesus the Way to the Father 5 Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?” 6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 7 If you really know me, you will know[b] my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.” 8 Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.” 9 Jesus answered: “Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? 10 Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. 11 Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves. 12 Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. 13 And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14 You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it. Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit 15 “If you love me, keep my commands. 16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever— 17 the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be[c] in you. 18 I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. 19 Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. 20 On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. 21 Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them.” 22 Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, “But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?” 23 Jesus replied, “Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. 24 Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me. 25 “All this I have spoken while still with you. 26 But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you. 27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid. 28 “You heard me say, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. 29 I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe. 30 I will not say much more to you, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold over me, 31 but he comes so that the world may learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me. “Come now; let us leave.",

I loved the beat of this song as soon as I heard it but to be honest when I heard and saw the video it inspired me and God used it to, of all things, pray for Kanye and others for God\u0027s will in their lives. I\u0027m christian and the song made me feel that when a person flows in God\u0027s destined will for their life they wield a power that everyone takes notice of. You flowing in your talent and gifts makes me feel like a champion and want to flow in my gifts and talent. Keep walking forward and be who God wants you to be but keep checking in with God to be your reality barometer and to steer you in your decisions and associates. And I\u0027ll share what he told me: if there are no consequences, you still have to do the right thing. Jesus is Lord",

In the Bible\u0027s Book of Daniel, Jesus is described as the \"son of man\" who comes with the clouds of heaven and is given eternal kingship:  Daniel\u0027s vision In Daniel 7, Daniel has a vision of four beasts coming out of the sea, and an angelic guide interprets them as kingdoms and kings. The last beast makes war on the \"holy ones\" of God, but is destroyed and the \"holy ones\" are given eternal dominion.  Jesus\u0027s role Jesus is described as the \"son of man\" who represents all sons and daughters of God. He is crushed by the beastly Roman Empire, but rises from his grave to take his seat at the right hand of the Ancient of Days. Jesus promises that those who remain faithful during the reign of the beasts will reign and be seated with him in the Heavenly places.  Jesus\u0027s return Jesus affirmed that he would one day return and bring his kingdom. The book of Revelation describes how the Son of Man is revealed, judges, and returns to establish his kingdom on earth. Yes APOSTLE Daniel",

The other day I was talking with my neighbours and they mentioned hearing weird noises like what I wrote about and I was just internally screaming the entire conversation.

  "❤❤❤❤ Isaiah 35 New International Version Joy of the Redeemed 35 The desert and the parched land will be glad;     the wilderness will rejoice and blossom. Like the crocus, 2 it will burst into bloom;     it will rejoice greatly and shout for joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it,     the splendor of Carmel and Sharon; they will see the glory of the Lord,     the splendor of our God. 3 Strengthen the feeble hands,     steady the knees that give way; 4 say to those with fearful hearts,     “Be strong, do not fear; your God will come,     he will come with vengeance; with divine retribution     he will come to save you.” 5 Then will the eyes of the blind be opened     and the ears of the deaf unstopped. 6 Then will the lame leap like a deer,     and the mute tongue shout for joy. Water will gush forth in the wilderness     and streams in the desert. 7 The burning sand will become a pool,     the thirsty ground bubbling springs. In the haunts where jackals once lay,     grass and reeds and papyrus will grow. 8 And a highway will be there;     it will be called the Way of Holiness;     it will be for those who walk on that Way. The unclean will not journey on it;     wicked fools will not go about on it. 9 No lion will be there,     nor any ravenous beast;     they will not be found there. But only the redeemed will walk there, 10     and those the Lord has rescued will return. They will enter Zion with singing;     everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them,     and sorrow and sighing will flee away.",

  "❤❤❤❤❤❤ Isaiah 40 New International Version Comfort for God’s People 40 Comfort, comfort my people,     says your God. 2 Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,     and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed,     that her sin has been paid for, that she has received from the Lord’s hand     double for all her sins. 3 A voice of one calling: “In the wilderness prepare     the way for the Lord[a]; make straight in the desert     a highway for our God.[b] 4 Every valley shall be raised up,     every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level,     the rugged places a plain. 5 And the glory of the Lord will be revealed,     and all people will see it together. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.” 6 A voice says, “Cry out.”     And I said, “What shall I cry?” “All people are like grass,     and all their faithfulness is like the flowers of the field. 7 The grass withers and the flowers fall,     because the breath of the Lord blows on them.     Surely the people are grass. 8 The grass withers and the flowers fall,     but the word of our God endures forever.” 9 You who bring good news to Zion,     go up on a high mountain. You who bring good news to Jerusalem,[c]     lift up your voice with a shout, lift it up, do not be afraid;     say to the towns of Judah,     “Here is your God!” 10 See, the Sovereign Lord comes with power,     and he rules with a mighty arm. See, his reward is with him,     and his recompense accompanies him. 11 He tends his flock like a shepherd:     He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart;     he gently leads those that have young. 12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,     or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket,     or weighed the mountains on the scales     and the hills in a balance? 13 Who can fathom the Spirit[d] of the Lord,     or instruct the Lord as his counselor? 14 Whom did the Lord consult to enlighten him,     and who taught him the right way? Who was it that taught him knowledge,     or showed him the path of understanding? 15 Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket;     they are regarded as dust on the scales;     he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust. 16 Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires,     nor its animals enough for burnt offerings. 17 Before him all the nations are as nothing;     they are regarded by him as worthless     and less than nothing. 18 With whom, then, will you compare God?     To what image will you liken him? 19 As for an idol, a metalworker casts it,     and a goldsmith overlays it with gold     and fashions silver chains for it. 20 A person too poor to present such an offering     selects wood that will not rot; they look for a skilled worker     to set up an idol that will not topple. 21 Do you not know?     Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning?     Have you not understood since the earth was founded? 22 He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth,     and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy,     and spreads them out like a tent to live in. 23 He brings princes to naught     and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing. 24 No sooner are they planted,     no sooner are they sown,     no sooner do they take root in the ground, than he blows on them and they wither,     and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff. 25 “To whom will you compare me?     Or who is my equal?” says the Holy One. 26 Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens:     Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one     and calls forth each of them by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength,     not one of them is missing. 27 Why do you complain, Jacob?     Why do you say, Israel, “My way is hidden from the Lord;     my cause is disregarded by my God”? 28 Do you not know?     Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God,     the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary,     and his understanding no one can fathom. 29 He gives strength to the weary     and increases the power of the weak. 30 Even youths grow tired and weary,     and young men stumble and fall; 31 but those who hope in the Lord     will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles;     they will run and not grow weary,     they will walk and not be faint.",

You are probably going through a very difficult time, and you have the impression that it is getting worse and worse, you don\u0027t know who to confide in, because the world is turning its back on you, your family can\u0027t understand you, or maybe -maybe you\u0027re simply afraid that he won\u0027t understand you. You are no longer sure of having real friends, you no longer sleep at night, you are tired, mentally, physically, spiritually. This world calls you weak, and you start to believe it, you are desperate. Know it, God is with you, he sees your pain, your suffering, your loneliness and he wants to help you and is just waiting for that. But for that, you have to open the door for him. God loves you with a love so pure that he sent his only son Jesus Christ to save you from death. So return to him and your heart will be at peace. BE BLESSED",

  "Hot Barz (FICTION) [Verse 1] Suffer from delirium and delivering Food, shivering under rain. Cinnamon And water make me bigger and I consider ‘em A vigor pill. Alcohol keeps killing will. Muse becomes different, friends indifferent. Weed is magnificent when I burn it for an immigrant. My blood is virulent like my kindred and A b…tch-a…ss commissioner. My general practitioner Shuns me like a prisoner. I’m the illest listener. I’m not innocent. I keep sinning and shock CNN. I’m the best MC in-in the world of screaming men. Spit about my seam and end. Victory is imminent Like semen and milky sea in-in Her deep C. Begin licking the steel gat again. Paradise is my Kattegat I get ecstatic at. Misery is my advocate. I get sadder but I wanna eat a halibut and live in a castle. Mad. Now I am ada-adamant. Ready to become extravagant. [Chorus] Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  [Verse 2] F…ck hazing. Guns blazing. Run amock. Crazy Like a nuclear sun daisy. My gun’s amazing. Retaliation is imminent like ej…culation. Humiliation is moral m…sturbation. I wanna become the master facing The music of celebration. Immigration To Canada is my hot dream. I ain’t gonna rot. Beam When I listen to a hip-hop theme. Screw my passport. Belong to the low class. Short On gas, watt, and grass stock. The swanky cuss. What?! I can be a crass dog. I embody an impasse. Shock The fat ones. Slog drives me nuts. Block Roads and tank farms. Mock big shots. Walk Down the Hell street. I sell beats to those who live in Well. Freaks Respect my bell. Deeds pile up like bed sheets.  I break a leg. Cheese! Smile and get upset. These Lines are dedicated to my Hell streets. [Chorus] Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  [Verse 3] I wanna restart my brain to alleviate my pain. I try to explain what train is gonna hit my game. Slight blame grows like Sly’s fame. Neither alright nor okay. No flight. No gain. I-I-I obtain nothing but eye pain. Envy the sky plane. F…ck my hand. You fuck a b…tch. I wanna strike it rich. But I visit a rocking bridge to get rid of vassalage. Kidding you. I choose a craggy ridge To gobble a happy midge. Daddy’s fridge Was empty like a valley. Pinch My salt, dude. I’m doped up on solitude. Dream of gratitude when I disturb quietude To outrap Ice Cube on YouTube. My-my habitude is breaking a habit, dude. I wanna buy a rocket to fly to Saskatoon. However, I vow to endeavor to find some money. Freedom is damn yummy. A bum’s tummy Gets fat after a scum rally. [Chorus] Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  [Verse 4] Metaverse after metaverse. Aletta is a better nurse. I let ‘er curse when her coochie reddens first. Cheddar and Purse make Aletta converse With my little fella. Worth being a go-getter. The hearse Is designed for Red Balds. No more khaki skirts! Bu-bukkake wh…res will go public first. I-I threaten jerks and reverse the debtor’s course Of history. Chicks love kissing me for my hefty pearls. My Chevy isn’t worse than MG Kelly’s hearse. Frenemies disperse when I shit in Beverly firms. Drink heavily. Mors invigorates… me at bigger raves. I dance with vigor. Dates cause semen waste. Hold my liquor, Grace. I love to trigger states Of crazy mind by kicking gates… of Hell. B…tches snigger. Baits are useful for bitter fates. Envy is my dinner, babes. My brain gets bigger. Face The music. You lose it to me sweating profusely. I run the Muse league. Walk in my shoes, Meek! Your crew’s weak like a red abuse clique. When I slap a tattooed cheek, frigging news shrieks. They call me Nude Freak. I shit in Puke Creek. [Chorus] Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  [Verse 5] Rapping is my rumphetamine. Count cheddar. Scream When a model drops her sweater seen On Brazzers. Motherf…ckers can’t forget the queen. Order a shredder. Clean like my sweater. Dream.  When I get better, mean tossers lose investor sheen. Reviewers are under pressure. Obscene Jokes get stuck in motherf…cking throats. I cause suckers’ strokes when I bug ‘em. Blokes Age like Hulk and Knowles. Shut up, folks! Take the plunge and liberties with A rancher who keeps stealing this Show. I poison her chicory’s root. Witcheries F…ck up when I cause her miseries By setting killer bees on her liver, knees, And tilburies full of skinny kinsmen Gs. Blade: Trinity’s more tedious than my guillotines. Pay all commission fees if you wanna keep breathing. Please Don’t fart in my vicinities. Only I can sin in these Cities and seas. Sowing evil seeds is a mere piece Of cake. Break a leg if you are my enemies. [Chorus] Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  [Verse 6] Forget about the orphanage. Memories often-often itch When you feel-feel forgotten, b…tch. A vile, fallen-fallen witch Wanna leave a wide rotten stitch. You are a foreign glitch. Northern walkers snitch on you. The world is a big zoo. Some blaggers intrigue you. They wanna rob a flick room To grab a chic jewel. Walk in a rich shoe and outsing-sing Wu. We got the big loot. Now we are chilling in Chile Inn. Relish sinning and sipping gin. Tripping in the hippy den. Keep grinning and filming slim strippers licking Dicky. Sin Is my hobby, b…tch. I forgot about the orphanage. My doctors itch when I slap ‘em and burn a bridge. Throw a hotter binge. No more slaughter, b…tch. My enormous midge protects me from alter-itch. I’ll never get older. Rich is my show name. The whole game Must go on like Crowe’s fame. I-I obtain bags of showcaine To clean my nose. Play with my Snow Babe.    [Chorus] Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  © Norfum 2024.",

  "As an Australian man born in the year 1820, I\u0027ve lived through a remarkable span of history, witnessing firsthand the rapid transformation of the world around me. From the early days of colonization to the rise of industrialization and beyond, I\u0027ve experienced the full spectrum of human triumphs and tragedies. In my youth, I roamed the vast Australian outback, traversing rugged landscapes and forging a life out of the wilderness. I witnessed the clash of cultures as European settlers arrived on indigenous lands, forever altering the course of history for better or for worse. As the years passed, I saw Australia grow and develop, from the bustling cities of Sydney and Melbourne to the sprawling cattle stations of the outback. I weathered economic booms and busts, droughts and floods, and the ever-changing tides of political upheaval. Through it all, I remained a steadfast observer of the world around me, watching as new technologies revolutionized the way we live and work. From the invention of the steam engine to the dawn of the information age, I marveled at humanity\u0027s boundless capacity for innovation and progress. But amidst the chaos and uncertainty of life, there was one constant that remained unchanged: my absolute love for Kanye West. From the moment I first heard his music, I was captivated by his boldness, his creativity, and his unapologetic authenticity. Through his lyrics, Kanye spoke to me in a way that no other artist could. His words resonated with the struggles and triumphs of my own life, offering solace and inspiration in equal measure. Whether I was toiling away in the harsh Australian sun or seeking refuge from the storms of life, Kanye\u0027s music was always there to lift me up and remind me of the power of art and expression. As I look back on the incredible journey of my life, I am filled with gratitude for the impact that Kanye West has had on me. His music has been a constant companion, guiding me through the trials and tribulations of life with unwavering grace and wisdom. And so, as I approach the twilight of my years, I find solace in the knowledge that no matter what the future may hold, I will always have Kanye West by my side, a beacon of light and inspiration in a world that is constantly changing.  As I sit by the crackling fire, reminiscing about the journey of my life, there\u0027s one truth that shines brighter than all the rest: Kanye West is the love of my life. His music has a way of reaching deep into my soul, igniting a fire within me that I never knew existed. From the moment I first heard his voice, I knew that he was something special, something truly extraordinary. His lyrics speak to me in a language that transcends words, evoking emotions and memories that I thought long forgotten. With each beat of the drum and every note of the melody, I feel a sense of connection to Ye that goes beyond mere admiration. His music makes me tingle with excitement, fills me with passion, and moves me in ways that I can\u0027t even begin to describe. Through the highs and lows of life, Kanye has been my constant companion, a guiding light in a world filled with darkness. His songs have been the soundtrack to my most cherished memories, the backdrop to my greatest triumphs and deepest sorrows. And though we may be separated by time and distance, I know that his music will always be there to remind me of the love and joy that he has brought into my life. So here\u0027s to Kanye West, the love of my life, the man whose music has touched my soul in ways that I never thought possible. As long as his songs continue to play, I will be forever grateful for the gift of his music and the impact that he has had on me. Thankyou Ye",

  "❤❤❤❤Luke 11 New International Version Jesus’ Teaching on Prayer 11 One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.” 2 He said to them, “When you pray, say: “‘Father,[a] hallowed be your name, your kingdom come.[b] 3 Give us each day our daily bread. 4 Forgive us our sins,     for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.[c] And lead us not into temptation.[d]’” 5 Then Jesus said to them, “Suppose you have a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread; 6 a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have no food to offer him.’ 7 And suppose the one inside answers, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can’t get up and give you anything.’ 8 I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship, yet because of your shameless audacity[e] he will surely get up and give you as much as you need. 9 “So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 10 For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. 11 “Which of you fathers, if your son asks for[f] a fish, will give him a snake instead? 12 Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? 13 If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”",
  "Romans 15 New International Version 15 We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves. 2 Each of us should please our neighbors for their good, to build them up. 3 For even Christ did not please himself but, as it is written: “The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.”[a] 4 For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they provide we might have hope. 5 May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had, 6 so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 7 Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God. 8 For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews[b] on behalf of God’s truth, so that the promises made to the patriarchs might be confirmed 9 and, moreover, that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written: “Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles;     I will sing the praises of your name.”[c] 10 Again, it says, “Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.”[d] 11 And again, “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles;     let all the peoples extol him.”[e] 12 And again, Isaiah says, “The Root of Jesse will spring up,     one who will arise to rule over the nations;     in him the Gentiles will hope.”[f] 13 May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.",

  "The reason I said I would challenge the Parenthood qualifications to the jury or to the judge is because some people breed for developmental purposes and some don\u0027t actually understand out I actually think that would be a great opportunity right now for a pair to bring that into an open court system and let it be heard to the public the whole case like that",

He started with Runaway and played about 10 songs by Kanye before he left. I asked the bartender who he was and he said I have no idea I\u0027ve never seen him before.

Really go back and look. It\u0027s hard to understand celebrities bc we don\u0027t imagine them as real people. This is just a guy who thinks we should love everyone and people need to adapt and learn to love again instead of hate. Yeah he\u0027s not really good with his words but again he is a normal person and this person was raised in Chicago with no college education and has a learning disability so why would you expect them to be able to word it perfectly? Just bc they\u0027re a celeb and we have a higher standard for them (falsely).

  "@@nathanplays5514a funny joke. That bad dude was one of the first animal rights activists, and he made Germany great again. Then, he needed scapegoats. I watched a documentary on why the Germans even allowed that crazy shit to happen. Farmers, laborers, along with doctors and lawyers got vacations every year. Germany was grey, littered, crime-ridden (grape right in the streets) after WWI. Most Germans were so damn happy, and they thought it would always be that way. I read many old letters asking “Why must we go to war?”. I saw that exact sentence in about 20 letters (I read German, but my confidence in speaking it has gone down the drain). If only Germany had a leader that just wanted the good of the country. Some of this sound familiar to y’all. We had an orange man try to serve more than two terms, make America great again, and wanted absolute power. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. We had a wannabe dictator on our hands, and it’s the far red’s fault if we let history repeat itself. We would actually be VOTING for it to happen (I’m purple, btw…centrist/mid-road). I feel like an outsider looking at this bipartisan bullshite. I am not down with WOKE, but the GOP are the sheep, not the dems. Dena have different thoughts. GOP has one. No thought required. If there’s an “R”, just fill it in. How are dems sheep? I really wish someone would explain that to me without shade and nastiness toward me or any group. Just an objective answer. Anyone?",

Never second guess what you think Timbaland. You deserved a feature here. In my opinion, I don\u0027t care if he only added three notes to the song.

  "“The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.” ‭‭2 Peter‬ ‭3:9‬ ‭NIV‬ Matthew 11:28-30  “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.” ROMANS 10:9-11 “If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame”  “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”” ‭‭Luke‬ ‭19:10‬ ‭ God wants us to believe in His One and Only Son, Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, who died for our sins :D When we truly believe in our hearts that Jesus is the Son of God, who died for our sins so we could have eternal life with God, we are saved, and have life in Jesus Christ 💗 Jesus genuinely loves you, and always waits for you to come to Him 🕊💕 May God bless you all ❤",

  "Panther heritage Shakur\u0027s parents, Afeni Shakur—born Alice Faye Williams in North Carolina—and his biological father, Billy Garland, had been active Black Panther Party members in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[23] A month before Shakur\u0027s birth, his mother was tried in New York City as part of the Panther 21 criminal trial. She was acquitted of over 150 charges.[24][25] Other family members who were involved in the Black Panthers\u0027 Black Liberation Army were convicted of serious crimes and imprisoned, including Shakur\u0027s stepfather, Mutulu Shakur, who spent four years among the FBI\u0027s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. Mutulu Shakur was apprehended in 1986 and subsequently convicted for a 1981 robbery of a Brinks armored truck, during which police officers and a guard were killed.[26] Shakur\u0027s godfather, Elmer \"Geronimo\" Pratt, a high-ranking Black Panther, was convicted of murdering a school teacher during a 1968 robbery. After spending 27 years in prison, his conviction was overturned due to the prosecution\u0027s having concealed evidence that proved his innocence.[27][28] Shakur\u0027s godmother, Assata Shakur, is a former member of the Black Liberation Army, who was convicted of the first-degree murder of a New Jersey State Trooper and is still wanted by the FBI.[29]",

  "❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Isaiah 40 New International Version Comfort for God’s People 40 Comfort, comfort my people,     says your God. 2 Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,     and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed,     that her sin has been paid for, that she has received from the Lord’s hand     double for all her sins. 3 A voice of one calling: “In the wilderness prepare     the way for the Lord[a]; make straight in the desert     a highway for our God.[b] 4 Every valley shall be raised up,     every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level,     the rugged places a plain. 5 And the glory of the Lord will be revealed,     and all people will see it together. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.” 6 A voice says, “Cry out.”     And I said, “What shall I cry?” “All people are like grass,     and all their faithfulness is like the flowers of the field. 7 The grass withers and the flowers fall,     because the breath of the Lord blows on them.     Surely the people are grass. 8 The grass withers and the flowers fall,     but the word of our God endures forever.” 9 You who bring good news to Zion,     go up on a high mountain. You who bring good news to Jerusalem,[c]     lift up your voice with a shout, lift it up, do not be afraid;     say to the towns of Judah,     “Here is your God!” 10 See, the Sovereign Lord comes with power,     and he rules with a mighty arm. See, his reward is with him,     and his recompense accompanies him. 11 He tends his flock like a shepherd:     He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart;     he gently leads those that have young. 12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,     or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket,     or weighed the mountains on the scales     and the hills in a balance? 13 Who can fathom the Spirit[d] of the Lord,     or instruct the Lord as his counselor? 14 Whom did the Lord consult to enlighten him,     and who taught him the right way? Who was it that taught him knowledge,     or showed him the path of understanding? 15 Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket;     they are regarded as dust on the scales;     he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust. 16 Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires,     nor its animals enough for burnt offerings. 17 Before him all the nations are as nothing;     they are regarded by him as worthless     and less than nothing. 18 With whom, then, will you compare God?     To what image will you liken him? 19 As for an idol, a metalworker casts it,     and a goldsmith overlays it with gold     and fashions silver chains for it. 20 A person too poor to present such an offering     selects wood that will not rot; they look for a skilled worker     to set up an idol that will not topple. 21 Do you not know?     Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning?     Have you not understood since the earth was founded? 22 He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth,     and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy,     and spreads them out like a tent to live in. 23 He brings princes to naught     and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing. 24 No sooner are they planted,     no sooner are they sown,     no sooner do they take root in the ground, than he blows on them and they wither,     and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff. 25 “To whom will you compare me?     Or who is my equal?” says the Holy One. 26 Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens:     Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one     and calls forth each of them by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength,     not one of them is missing. 27 Why do you complain, Jacob?     Why do you say, Israel, “My way is hidden from the Lord;     my cause is disregarded by my God”? 28 Do you not know?     Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God,     the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary,     and his understanding no one can fathom. 29 He gives strength to the weary     and increases the power of the weak. 30 Even youths grow tired and weary,     and young men stumble and fall; 31 but those who hope in the Lord     will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles;     they will run and not grow weary,     they will walk and not be faint.",

  "❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Romans 10 New International Version 10 Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved. 2 For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge. 3 Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness. 4 Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes. 5 Moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law: “The person who does these things will live by them.”[a] 6 But the righteousness that is by faith says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’”[b] (that is, to bring Christ down) 7 “or ‘Who will descend into the deep?’”[c] (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). 8 But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,”[d] that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: 9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. 11 As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.”[e] 12 For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, 13 for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”[f] 14 How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? 15 And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”[g] 16 But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?”[h] 17 Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ. 18 But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: “Their voice has gone out into all the earth,     their words to the ends of the world.”[i] 19 Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, “I will make you envious by those who are not a nation;     I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding.”[j] 20 And Isaiah boldly says, “I was found by those who did not seek me;     I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.”[k] 21 But concerning Israel he says, “All day long I have held out my hands     to a disobedient and obstinate people.”[l]",

  "❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ John 5 New International Version Faith in the Incarnate Son of God 5 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well. 2 This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands. 3 In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome, 4 for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. 5 Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. 6 This is the one who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 For there are three that testify: 8 the[a] Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement. 9 We accept human testimony, but God’s testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son. 10 Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony. Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son. 11 And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. Concluding Affirmations 13 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life. 14 This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him. 16 If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that. 17 All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death. 18 We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them. 19 We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one. 20 We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. 21 Dear children, keep yourselves from idols",

Had him forcibily institionalised by a j*w handler who found another j*w doctor to drug him against his will because Ye spoke out against the system and supported Trump. The same handler leaked it to TMZ that Ye was put in hospital. Who owns TMZ...another J*w. Ye speaks out against Kushner subverting the presidency for money and foreign interests and wanted to expose the bad business practices. They collude as a unit a smear campagin against him in the media. He makes a tweet with a typo and he gets de-banked and loses all his deals worth billions. Not organically but due to covert effort by powerful J*ws like Ari Emanuel (brother of Rahm Emanuel) and powerful Jwish groups like \"stop anti-semitism\", \"zoa\" and \"ADL\" get his business deals cancelled. Due to mafia like tactics threatening those companies.   Not only that the same handler who drugged him up 6 years ago threatned to do it again unless he \"apologised\".  That\u0027s real hate. Keep in mind these same groups and people that never had an issue with Weinstein,Polanski or Epstein. Never got their bank accounts revoked or funds frozen. I wonder why...? why are you making out Jews are the victims here? They are not. They are the aggressor.  They are a powerful untouchable group whom if you even get close to criticising or questioning their level of pwoer. People\u0027s lives get destroyed in what is suppose to be a \"free\" nation. Ye wants reparations, affordable housing, wealth and empowerment for the black community. Who aren\u0027t even control of their own talent and industries they dominant.

Think about that?!?! He was being set up. But THANK GOD! Who has been working in His life and watching over him. He was dropped by his affiliations and this companies are now exposed for their dark dealings and sick perversions.  Kanye is not crazy and is not a Hitler lover the way they making you think. He said that comment in the context of a REAL CHRISTIAN! Who are called to love everyone including our enemies. YES!!! That includes Hitler and as radical as it sounds that’s true Christianity.  IN FACT!!! The religious Jews of that time KILLED Jesus because he called them out to be HYPOCRITES! And were condemning him and making up stories about Jesus that were not true. Jesus was humble and teaching to love everyone including the Gentiles( non Jews). He told them the truth that He was their messiah and Son of God, the King of the Jews, that he was going to die and resurrect from the death. But they rejected him and crucified him still. With evil in their hearts. They tried to hide and deny His  Resurrección and  THEY STILL DO!!! But Jesus is King and alive and will keep making ways for the rest of the world to hear the good news of the gospel so they can be saved.  God looks at the intentions of the heart  not the outward appearances. We can’t change ourselves, only God can. Only Jesus can save us from ourselves. And only He can change our evil intentions. He died to give us a new heart and new spirit. New life! So we can love one another with a sincere heart not selfish love but real,  no one is perfect and Jesus died for every single human no matter how bad they are or were. Only God can judge and bring condemnation.  And if anyone believes in faith in Jesus Christ as personal savior they can be saved. We’re called to pray for everyone not cancel or hate them. To be patient and help one another.  That’s what Ye meant at Alex Jones interview not that he loved Hitler for killing people but as a soul who was lost and needed redemption. Ye loves everyone and even his enemies. He has said it so many times! He loves the Jews. But the demonic and satanic power behind the very higher ups in the entertainment industry, political and economic powers happened to be Jewish and they don’t like Christianity. That’s why they love promoting a destructive culture of death, occultism dark arts, sexual perversion, reckless lifestyles etc. They don’t really care about us. So the media is their tool and takes out of context the sound bites and Manipulate the narrative. To cancel and make Ye look like he’s crazy but that’s far from the truth. Listen to full interviews of Ye. Don’t believe the media. Peace and grace. 🙏😊",

  "This song changed my life. I was 12, in 6th grade, heard this and became obsessed with Daft Punk. My dad won tickets to Vegoose 2007, so Daft Punk was my first concert. Got inadvertently high for the first time because of how much weed was in the air, decided weed wouldn\u0027t kill me, despite what the D.A.R.E officer had convinced me of. Daft Punk\u0027s discovery album got me obsessed with EDM. Started going to raves in Detroit in 2008, at 13, and I never looked back.",

  "Schroeder Bank : At a later stage, Schroeder Bank of Frankfurt am Main also took part. Baron Kurt Schroeder was Hitler’s personal banker and SS Gruppenfuhrer (equivalent to Lieutenant general). From 1938, Schroeder Bank represented the Nazi Financial interests in Britain. In the United States, Schroeder and Rockefeller merged some of their business interests. Avery Rockefeller, son of Percy Rockefeller, was vice president of the Schroder Banking Corporation of New York (Page 367). William Randolf Hearst: Soon after the agreement between Hitler and the international bankers, the American press mogul William Randolf Hearst began to show great interest in the Nazi Party and its leader Adolf Hitler. The New York Times covered Hitler’s speeches. The Harvard University Magazine published a lengthy survey of National Socialism. The British press magnate Harold Sidney Rothmere added his voice to the National Socialist propagandists. Book: Architects Of Deception by Yuri Lina.",

  "HOW PEOPLE\u0027S LIVES ARE ADMINISTERED 1st choice: comfortable life (human contacts, fun, relationships, easy work) 2nd choice: remedy the one made by the first choice (all the opposite of the life of the first)  3rd choice, etc.: no personality suitable to survive, probable life as a tramp (in the middle of the street), absolutely no human contact, fun, future, precious things, relationships. With the personality they give you to do all these things it will be too complicated. Probable acts of violence or discrimination, no work or if there is very hard. High probability of suicide.  Procedure: there comes a time when suddenly Christ and Satan show up in front of the mirror and by deception force to choose one of the two. By choosing the first, the following things happen: Christ, the Virgin Mary and in case some saints show up and in case you are playing or having fun in any way they force you to work and toil helping someone always with their voice and their words inside your head. Their procedure consists of this: prevent you from having fun, drinking, masturbating, etc. and getting sledding like a mule.      Being as they say second choice, you should only work from morning to night and nothing else. Anything else is not good for them. At first Christ pretends to be God and shows you how he pretends to give you gifts by putting for a moment a kind of white glow at the height of the navel and telling you that they give a \"gift\" to everyone and no more than one but in reality, they are all lies that as you go on, they come out on their own. They try to frame you with vague promises, rewards and various scum once in what they call \"paradise\", but once they verify that the element in question doesn\u0027t take the bait (because he’s not a moron!) they begin to reveal their infamous procedures that they have implemented to try to ruin his life.   As a second choice you are given a very antisocial, extreme and stray personality so that you cannot have any kind of contact with other people (friendships, relationships) because you see everyone else as if they came from another planet and there is no kind of compatibility. In addition to this your physique is damaged with the following things and for the following reasons: first you will have few or no muscles at all as having been damaged at birth you will be sick and you will have a disposition to make revenge and war against everyone; per second you will have some knee problems that will prevent you from practicing any type of sport in a serious way and third you will have some kind of defect or imperfection in intimate parts such as various spots, in, strange shapes, etc. so as to prevent you from having any kind of relationship.      The second choice should according to their infamous system try to remedy the wrong things that someone who died 40 years ago or more has combined.  In paradise a kind of personal \"circle\" is created where there are the spirits of all the people who have had some kind of importance in your life: family members, sports idols, musicians, actors or characters compatible with your personality or with the life you have to make. All these characters are obliged to show up and say certain phrases with the purpose of deceiving and doing things that the person in question would not do in itself. They also take advantage of the relationship of admiration you had for them when they were alive to get you to have a conversation, but it\u0027s all a lie, the real purpose is to analyze your way of thinking and acting and your personality to see if you can overcome certain obstacles, cheating and lies that will try to get you on the road.     Of all the characters you see the Virgin Mary is the most annoying of all. She talks all the time saying a lot of lies to see if someone is so stupid to believe in it (like their altar boys) and she always and constantly repeats the same things until nausea (procedure). She cries all the time and says she\u0027s the most beautiful woman in the world.      Their way of speaking is to repeat in your head their phrases that irritate and provoke and annoy you to the point of nausea as the angriest you are, the more your nerves jump and the more vulnerable you are to them because you could lose control of your actions and do what they want. They never believe in threats to make them stop until they are put into practice.  At the beginning of the journey if you rebel against their infamous system, they can resort to making the devil appear. Not having chosen him appears much poorer than he appears to his followers. He can appear in many different forms but usually appears with red eyes and the stick it uses to subdue its followers. Among the things he does to you we find: images of spiders quite credible in the head, temptations of various kinds very treacherous. At first it makes you think he wants to take you into his group by always making you trawls to try to frame yourself (for example women you might have, things that might happen to you, etc.) and then tries to bother you at night by showing you his red eyes, goat legs, strange faces and telling you to come to his group. To try to submit use a kind of feeling of great warmth at the height of the navel that is transmitted throughout the body and that almost gives the feeling of fainting. It is overcome by always being in the company of someone, as it must be stealthy and cannot leave traces. During submission attempts, every thought, everything read and seen, and every memory will be used as a weapon against you.        On some occasions it may go so far as to tell you to give him your soul, that is, to perform the following ritual: to write explicitly your intention on a sheet of paper, to bring blood out of your body and sign with it. As a final act burn the sheet (which is absolutely to be avoided as then you do not go back).      Their followers to get any kind of role in hell must sacrifice everything they have in life and kill someone, better if someone they care about or some complete stranger and as a final gesture themselves.  Demons cannot bring anything out and it must be the adept who performs certain rituals to learn new things and improve level, but at each of these acts their lives are ruined more and more. Hell consists of 9 levels.  The souls of people who commit suicide are struck by the eyes little by little until they get their eyes ripped, a process that lasts years and they have to turn 15 turns before they can be saved.",

Ye didn\u0027t do the holocaust. he had 1 bad opinion.

  "@@joshdfox420 yeah I mean you had Jeffery Dahmers neighbor saying his sister had a wedding and he was broke and Jeffery Dahmer had given him $60 so he could get a present for his sister\u0027s wedding. and that he was good to him. but underneath it all he had 11 dead bodies all chopped up in his apartment. even the worst person on earth can do a good deed here and there. but its the person as a whole. people won\u0027t remember dahmer for helping his neighbors. they will remember him for being an evil prolific serial killer. nothing redeems the monstrous acts he did. I think Ye is mistaken to believe everyone has redeeming qualities. but hes getting advice from known bigots like Nick Fuentes. and he\u0027s clearly having a hard time with his divorce and losing his kids. and the 2.1 billion dollars he lost instantly with 1 tweet. he\u0027s bipolar and in that kind of manic state. but this is like Charlie sheen or britney spears. he\u0027ll likely come back down to a better place soon. and the people that have taken advantage of his situation to gain clout will end up falling off.. but Ye will come out a stronger person in the end. you have a lot of people that just dont care what he said. my self included. and hey he makes pretty good music. and usually an artist\u0027s best stuff comes out when they are down and out. I think Ye a good person and trying to do right but hes just being mislead like I said. and so what people that never really listened to his music got mad at what he said. his fans still there.. you can\u0027t just cancel the guy. he will still exsist. look at what they did to alex jones hes making even more money now than when he was on youtube and Facebook and twitter. all that came out in all these court cases he was just in. I see the same for Ye. so what no corporate sponsors. you don\u0027t need that anymore. look at Tom McDonald or all the other independent people even people that have been \"debanked\" and \"deplatfotmed\" this is a new era. the corperations no longer have the power they used to. and I think its a good thing. I will support a parallel economy to the fullest. getting cancelled could happen to us all. even if you\u0027re not in the lime light. happens to people regular people all the time. that\u0027s part of the bigger agenda of social credit scores ect based off this woke nonsense. the more people we can get into the parallel economy the better. and I am glad Ye will be part of the alternative. your only going to see this more and more as the culture war gets worse.",

Jeffery dahmer has a lot of fans as well. they make money off these peoples names too with horror movies and documentaries ect. because there is a huge market for that. you can do the most evil vile things like killing young children and not only will you get fans based on that. youll get movies about you profiting off those peoples deaths. we live in a sick world. kanye didnt kill anyone. he just said some stuff. and I mean look at charles manson he makes millions a year selling his art work to his fans..",

You can\u0027t actually say anybody who\u0027s lived on this planet for at least 20 years is ignorant of the freaking Holocaust. Yes he didn\u0027t do the Holocaust but he said, and maintains, a VERY problematic opinion. It\u0027s literally pro-genocide, like my mind cannot comprehend how in tf this is even slightly justifiable.

He\u0027s practically gone and said he\u0027s happy that your parents died. How on Earth are you capable of defending that shit?

  "Kanye West, I am old and never listened to ya.  You are something!  It is a real testament when someone can reach out through to crazed and destructive world we have with it\u0027s authoritarian and oppressive institutions bearing down on us all, and be a shining light.  For the record, I probably wouldn\u0027t go about things the way Kanye is currently, but then again, it should be said, that is most likely because of my lack of genius in comparison.  His interviews are really works of art.  He can turn a phrase in a way or emphasize a way about his responses or tangent musings that can sound diametrically different to different listeners.  If you haven\u0027t given Kanye West a full listen, you are missing what is wrong with America today.  YOU.  For anyone dismissing this guy had better get you mirrors out and get ready to look at who is staring back at you.  I hope you are hungry because Kanye is serving up crow for dinner.   If, indeed, you need my support, let it be known that I am Team Ye.  Fuck those evil forces and stay stronger, because you got this.  My discovering your genius has helped me get stronger, and, while I don\u0027t have much to give, just know that there are lots of us out here who have had their kids taken away, been misdiagnosed, and been shuffled off to the edge of society who are giving their support and have your back.   It is no small thing to speak your mind on YouTube.  Thank you for being worth the risk to speak out and be heard.",

This is probably a delusion, and a tragic one at that, but it is my delusion.  Kanye surely doesn\u0027t need my support, he is doing well enough on his own. I am late to the party, because I have not been in the target market for his musings, and because of my tendency towards thinking hip hop or rap kinda sucked   I didn\u0027t like sampling when it was new, and felt it was something of a disrespectful thing to the Parliaments and the James Browns of the world.  So, I didn\u0027t give much time to what he had to say.  This wasn\u0027t helped by the places I would see his name come up....  For instance he said something at an MTV Music Awards and caused a stir, he married Kim Kardashian who I never thought much of...  Then all of a sudden he is on Lix Friedman\u0027s podcast running his mouth about Jews..or so I thought. I like Fridman  and gave it a listen.  Then I see him wearing a white lives matter shirt.  Damn.  As I am listening, it is clear that Kanye is playing possum.  I see this, and see Lex as being disrespectful.  That\u0027s strange, Lex doesn\u0027t do that.... Then Kanye interrupts Lex and says something like, \"you know what\u0027s crazy, is we sometimes forget that we are on the same side.\"",
  "@@hangedman7547 Dearest Mr. Hanged.  I am not sure about much, in fact, I am mostly sure about one thing.  I don\u0027t: know nuffin\u0027.  The overlords are, bad news, I will grant you that, and sure enough, if you give em an inch they are off to the races  well, Kanye was on the side of the human race, and that I can support.  Should his musings turn in a way that I find distasteful or even downright evil, I will speak up. However, right now, I feel that the evil I am standing against us tyranny....it is stifling opinion through censorship.  It is people being treated as a monolithic group of shared beliefs and politics based on some immutable characteristic, and then labeling others in that way.   The conspiracies are real, they are just not limited to one race or gender, but they are against America.....  Well, I am American, and I think we ain\u0027t so bad.  I think that Kanye is in the middle of some cancel culture shit that is unamerican, and if it is jews using their power to shut down a guy who is going through a divorce and losing his kids, under the banner of policing antisematism, rather than honest discussion, then I have no issue with Kanye bringing this up.  The response, so far looks a lot like your overlords....  But looks can be and are deceiving.i have a feeling that it isn\u0027t Jews or blacks or whites or Muslims that make up the cabal\u0027s ranks. I don\u0027t think the Russians or the Chinese people are bad.., but I doN\u0027t like how their governments have acted.  The same goes for America ....it is the ideas of authoritarian and totalitarian or globalist agendas that I have an issue with.",
  "And if I haven\u0027t written enough, here is some more of my worthless opinions.  We are told of an oppressive Patriarchy, and toxic masculinity, and anti semetism and systemic racism.  If you are out there lying and manipulating kids to radicalize them, be it Drag Queen Story Hour,  Lebron Talking of being hunted down, #Me Too, or Anita Hill.....then, you are my enemy.  Keeping Kanye from his kids is an abomination and my government should be called out for the attrocities of Family Court... And whether you are pro choice or pro life, the government shouldn\u0027t be forcing those who are against abortion to pay for abortions.  No kid should be driven to fearful extremes by their favorite basketball star misleading the children about police shootings or fake danger to them from a virus.

Number  1, if censorship  is removed  don\u0027t  you think  that some people  with racist ideologies  will try to divide  your nation , they may even be funded by china. Number 2, As you must be aware that recent elections  are won by democrats  again,  all I know they are experts  in dividing your nation into multiple genders , races  and identities  , how come they are winning, even though  their  leader is a senile  old man ,how come they are winning  again  and again",
  "@@hangedman7547 it is hard for me to explain, but my best effort is that they cheat.  They also do lots of stuff that falls just short of cheating.  They also work hard to change the rules to make what was cheating, illegal.  They also have cover from the news organizations and even social media to make sure their malfeasance is only found out after it is too late.  The biggest problem is  they have a big headstart in the communist takeover infiltration game.  It is unbelievable to think that the party of JFK is the party of J Biden.  For many, the connections between their party and The KKK, or Eugenics programs are far enough removed to get a pass, but when they control the schools and the media it is a hard slog to get the woke to awaken.  It is basically the same old divide and conquer strategy that the radical left use to co-opt movements and the Democratic Party and their mass of well-meaning members who don\u0027t seem to be on the same page to slowly fill the positions of power until the whole government is terminally infected.  Luckily, they can\u0027t well enough seem to deal the fatal blow, which gives the conservatives and real liberals a chance to play catch-up and tamp it down at least for a decade or two.  If they spent as much effort in building up America as they do trying to tear it apart, maybe others would think that we are actually on to something and be worth emulating.  Maybe we can snuff it out a little better than we did in the 90s.",

  "@@hangedman7547 Dear Mr. Man, I got blabbering on and on about the Democrats, but forgot to answer your first question.  If they stop the censorship people will be inbound to fight back with words.  Americans are a pragmatic and individualistic lot, historically.  The Commie way of splitting us up doesn\u0027t work when we have strong families.  The residual who we are as Americans is frankly people who left other places because of tyranny, so we fight for liberty, we fight for individual freedom, and we fight the right to speak our minds.  Some people haven\u0027t been pushed to fight yet, others are censored, but rest assured there will be a backlash to the bullshit going on trying to take America down.  That being said, I hope we don\u0027t go too far, in an unjust backlash.  For it is ugly when the feminists did, it shall be ugly if the patriarchy goes overboard.",

However, I would rather wait for it all to be finished, so that none may perish, but eternal life through Jesus Christ may be had by all who would believe in HIM!  If it were up to me, the whole world would be with HIM! Even those who have done wrong, made new in HIM! Pure and true. So that death need not continue, that we can be free from even that chain.  Jesus please! I believe that if the Father Wills it, 911 will have a new meaning, so that even those who follow Islam can be seen that they only ever did your will. Though many jumped from a burning tower, it would be a sign of the time given! I believe it would be the perfect time, and that a day that holds so much anguish for many would be made NEW!  What could be more perfect than for YOU to make tragedy of that magnitude have a different light for all mankind! Please! I am asking!",

Most neo-nazi groups do not abide by the National Socialist economic policies instead opting for the more racial supremacist or xenophobic aspects of Nazism.  \"Devout\" Christian is also pretty goddang rich, making a song doesn\u0027t make you devout if you fail to adhere to most of the tenets.

I don’t know what you mean by “properly”; was it not a proper reading unless I accepted Jesus as my personal lord and savior after reading? 🤣 You can read something well and still notice that it contains a lot of flaws. In fact, in the case of the Gospel, a proper reading _should_ lead to you finding some stuff wrong with it, because it’s _not_ actually divinely inspired. Sorry! Read The Age of Reason, now _that’s_ a book with some common sense. Aaaand if you would seriously (lmao) consult a _priest_ over a modern biologist in questions of reproduction, Mr. “I’m not religious”…then you’re just too far gone. I’m obviously not gonna get very far in conversing with someone _that_ deluded. Sorry again!",
  "@@zanews23 There is a zero percent chance that a priest would say that a man can get pregnant. There\u0027s a good chance a modern doctor would. Like I said, read the Catechism which explains what the Gospel means. Then read the Gospel some more.",
  "@@Levitiy Do you know why? Because a doctor might dare to use a definition of “man” a bit too advanced for you. In questions of medicine, it’s pretty dumb to listen to people who have studied theology over people who have studied, you know…medicine…just because the person who studied theology will comfort you with his socially conservative words. Many priests (in Eastern Orthodoxy; don’t know about Catholicism) will also tell people with celiac disease that it’s perfectly safe to eat consecrated hosts that contain gluten just because “nothing with the Lord’s blessing would ever bring you harm!” Listening to priests in questions of medicine is the first step to winning a Darwin Award. Be my guest, but I’m not gonna be dumb enough to disregard whole fields of experts because they disagree with my politics. (Maybe that’s a hint for you that they’re not the ones with the shitty politics based on lies. But like I said…too far gone.) Now I swear by Allah, if you say something that low-IQ again, I’m done.

  "Ye vipers; Ye generation of hypocrites! Slither off and flee and such; And shiver at the angels touch. Ye Vipers, snipers, haters, too: Hypocrites be less than few.... Fork tongued ways at an end; Now the vipers find no friend. Them hypocritic oaths no more, Shall never now, come to fore. 2 Esdras [41] For the earth hast thou not judged with truth.  [42] For thouhast afflicted the meek, thou hast hurt the peaceable, thou hast loved liars, and destroyed the dwellings of them that brought forth fruit, and hast cast down the walls of such as did thee no harm.  [43] Therefore is thy wrongful dealing come up unto the Highest, and thy pride unto the Mighty. \"And The Most High God of Israel, The Lord of Hosts and King of Jacob, shall send The Mighty One of Israel, The Word of Life, The Son of Man,\u0027Eisa bin Maryam, and prowling as The Lion of Judah, He shall Come as A Thief in The Night, seeking out the Antichrist / Deceiver the Dajjal and bring about the end of days, and the beginning of eternity.  Allah will send \u0027Eisa bin Maryam, who will come down at the white minaret in the east of Damascus, wearing two Mahrud[garment dyed with Wars and then Saffron], resting his hands on the wings of two angels. When he lowers his head, beads of perspiration will fall from it. Every disbeliever who smells the fragrance of his breath will die, and his breath will reach as far as his eye can see. Then he will set out and catch up with him (the Dajjal) at the gate of Ludd, and will kill him. Then the Prophet of Allah \u0027Eisa will come to some people whom Allah has protected, and he will wipe their faces and tell them of their status in Paradise.  Hadith No: 4055 From: Sunan Ibn Majah.

  "Are you a good person? Let’s check and see! Have you ever stolen? (Even if it’s something really small or not worth much) Have you ever lied? Or have you ever looked with lust ? Now,  have you ever taken the Lords Name in vain? Have you ever hated someone?If you’ve ever done any of those things, you would be either a liar, a thief, an adulterer,(for looking with lust. See Matthew 5:28), a blasphemer(for taking Gods Name in vain), a murderer (for hating someone. See 1 John 3:15) or maybe even all of them. And that was only 5 of the Ten Commandments. Therefore we have all sinned against God and  therefore deserve death.(Romans 3:23 \u0026 6:23)That’s why ~2000 years ago A Savior was sent; Jesus Christ, to die for the sins of the world and then He rose 3 days later. Through His sacrifice He Paid The Fine for our sins, and made Atonement for the sins of the world. Now we can be made new by accepting The Gift of Salvation. In order to accept This Gift,  we must first Repent. This is a change of mind about sin  (from an embrace of sin to rejection of sin) and a Turning to God.  Once you Repent, you can then turn to FAITH/TRUST in the Savior. A person who has truly Repented of their sin and has Trust in Christ will give evidence of a changed life. Therefore, as a Result of Salvation you’ll then produce Good Works and the Fruit of Salvation. (Reading the Word and Obeying It, Acts of Kindness, readiness to help, to serve, to give of oneself, The Fruits of the Spirit, etc.) You aren’t saved by doing Good Works, but you can then produce Good Works once you are Saved.",

  "So, just as in Germany in the 1930\u0027s when the Jewish community was targeted by Hitler. Major Jewish business owners exerted their power against the non-Jewish German people. Hurting many non-Jewish, non-Nazi Germans. So, too today the Jewish community proved Kanye West statement correct. Who else has the power to rape a man in the public square of his largest wallet of endorsements and contracts. Except the Jews!  But then again, all those contracts were with Jewish owned companies. Not African American owned companies. And the one and a half billion was in a Jewish owned financial institution. Kanye, Kanye! Even Elon Musk castle\u0027s his Queen. Why, do you think the Jewish business community hates encrypted currency soooo! much! It could have RAPED! Jewish financial institution of most of their power over African Americans.",

  "The Gospel ¨For God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.¨ John 3:16 ¨For i delivered to you first of all that which i also received: how Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, was buried, rose again the third day according to the scriptures,¨  1 Corinthians 15:3-4 ¨Jesus answered, ¨Truly, truly I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.¨  John 3:5 ¨that if you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God has raised from the dead, you will be saved,¨ Romans 10:9 The story: God loved the world(us) so much that He gave His one and only Son to die in our place. If you ever feel like you\u0027re not loved, remember the creator of the universe sent His Son to die in your place regardless if you believe in him or not! ¨Why did Jesus have to die?¨ Because all of God\u0027s creation has rebelled against Him at some point, Yes! Even You and I. When God created everything in existence, He looked at it and said ¨It is Good.¨ Well I think we can all agree humanity as a whole is not good! We were made in the image of God yet as whole we are not good. We kill, steal, lie, commit crimes, ignore the needy, don´t obey our parents, we break the laws, and humanity as a whole has done every sort of evil under the sun. ¨Well I\u0027m a good person!¨ To who´s standard? You have done at least one thing on the list above. Can you comfortably say lying is a trait of being a good person? What about stealing? You can say that but that would make you a liar and that would only prove my point. God creates the standard of good not us! His standard of good is perfect and none of us are perfect. Don´t let the arrogant ¨Christians¨ in church fool you either. They also are not perfect and need Jesus just as much as You and I. ¨So wait, why did Jesus have to die?¨ The answer is sin. We have all sinned and fell short of t he glory of God. According to word, all of us will die someday and we will have to be face to face with God and give an account of everything we have ever done in our lives, good or bad. Your next question may be ¨does God know everything we have ever done?¨ The answer is yes, He is all knowing and Has a book of everything little thing you have ever done in your life and you will be judged off what you have done. Imagine this, you have to go to court to prove your innocence. You´re on trial and God is the judge. God will call your name and go through your book. He is going to ask why have you gone against him with the way you live and then ask if you think you really deserve to go to heaven. At this point any person would be terrified and speechless. How can we tell a perfect, Holy and all knowing God we deserve to go to heaven? We can´t! The bible says the wages of sin is death! In other words, one sin is enough to say you don\u0027t deserve to go to heaven. Wages means ¨something we have earned¨ when you work, your wages are a paycheck. When you sin, your wages are death. But the good news is if we place our trust in Jesus He acts as our lawyer. The Bible says he has the ability to blot out our sins! He can go in our book and remove anything that would keep us from going to heaven. How does that work exactly? Again the Bible says the wages of sin is death! Meaning for every sin something or someone has to die. Jesus came and died on the cross in our place. He took the punishment for us! He basically went into court and paid our fines so the judge could legally let us go. Jesus paid a price we could never afford.  So Where is Jesus now? He is in heaven! God is a just and good father. He would never send his child to hell. Want to hear the greatest news in the history of the world? ¨But to all who believed in him and accepted him, He gave the right to become children of God. They are reborn-not with a physical birth resulting from human passion or plan, but a birth that comes from God.¨ John 1:12-13 You can become a child of God! How do you do that? You have to believe in Jesus and His good news! What is the good news? The Gospel literally means the good news. This is the gospel: ¨I passed on to you what was most important and what had also passed on to me. 1.) Christ died for our sins, just as the scriptures said. 2.) He was buried, and 3.) He was raised on the third day, just as the Scriptures said.¨ 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 ¨Based on this how can I go to heaven?¨ ¨If you that Jesus is Lord and 2.) believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved For it is believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved. As the Scriptures tell us, ¨Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.¨ Romans 10:9-11 Jesus calls all men everywhere to repent(forsake sin).       Although God overlooked the periods of ignorance, now He commands everyone everywhere to repent. Acts 17:30.  But if the wicked turns from all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all My laws and does what is lawful and right, he will surely live, he will not die. Ezekiel 18:21 It\u0027s not just a confession of sins but a change of action. Without repentance we will not inherit the kingdom of God. Peter said to them, “Repent, and let each of you be immersed in the name of Messiah Yeshua for the removal of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Ruach ha-Kodesh. Acts 2:38       One who covers up his transgressions will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them finds mercy. Proverbs 28:13.  Following Jesus isn\u0027t just a one time thing or a prayer; it\u0027s a relationship with him until the very end.       But the one who endures to the end will be saved. Matthew 24:13.  If you are reading this all of this he is calling you to repentance he doesn\u0027t want you or anyone to perish but that all may be saved choose today whom you will serve.         For He says, “At a favorable time I listened to you, in a day of salvation I helped you.” Behold, now is the favorable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation. 2 Corinthians 6:2  To those who truly repent(turn from sins) and believe in Jesus/Yeshua you will be gifted the holy spirit which will give you the power to obey and God\u0027s laws will be written on your heart.       “This is the covenant that I will cut with them: ‘After those days,’ says Adonai , ‘I will put My Torah upon their hearts, and upon their minds I will write it,’” then He says,“I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.” Now where there is removal of these, there is no longer an offering for sin. Hebrews 10:16‭-‬18  Whatever we have done it can be forgiven only through the blood of messiah      for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the removal of sins. Matthew 26:28  God also gives us power over sin to not just to forgive us and save us. For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, training us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live in a manner that is self-controlled and righteous and godly in the present age.

Meaning 12 is the first. 12 exposes the systems. 1 Does all the Ventilation. 2 Creates a whole new system. Ideas in general and//or stemming from all that ventilation. 3 can expose the waves of can as a whole. Changes may have been made but are they progressive? Are they lasting? Is it a pendulum swing? For all the changes how are we still here? And also can talk about tmrws dreams also. 3 Is juts very into tmrw and learning from today to make a better tmrw. 4 Can get to the root of the problem. That FBI friend... You know the one. You need a deadline before you go in. Or else you can just// run the risk of just keep going on and on and on and on!!! Hence 11 has a Net!!! For Some not for all. 5 Is \"Bold like a Lion\" -- THB. Or \"Pride comes before the fall\" -- THB. You can grow through one to the other. Like Ackee 5 can be poisonous if not cooked correctly. 6. Will catch that little bit that 5 cannot do. You try to get it all you might just risk losing it all. So leave before youre ready. 6 Can make an ocean out of a puddle. Can make a mountain out of a pebble. Can Make a Lot of it righteousness out of a little bit of it righteousness. It does not mean that they should leave on crumbs. Just that If you have to get to the root of the problem to uproot the corrupt roots. Think removing dandelions. If you just cut them and leave the roots then they can grow back. Where 4 can get to the root of the problems. Saving half for harvest. For 8. If they miss that little that is there half. But would risk them losing it all. That little bit of root that needs to be picked up 6 can get it. And uncover it all; if they want to. Now five is the one that exposes all the lies just by being themselves. Like a flower from the concrete. All theyve got to be is be true. It wasnt always concrete//sidewalk, driveways, etc whatever there was earth beneath here once!!! There is earth beneath here again!!! 5 Just needs to be themselves. Bold like a Lion. Sometimes a maturing Lion is Pride before the fall until they are mature enough to be bold like a lion. Hence why limits and listening to yourself and \"Believing in yourself\" -- Arthur theme song is soo important. If youre not yet ready for that level its okay. Even if its a smaller level that youre on. Thats okay!! What are you ready to honestly and authentically do. Not everyone can start off cooking large batches of ackee some people gotta start small. Learn to walk before you run!!! And run before you fly. Because to fall from a  level that youre ready for. You can bounce back much easier. But to fall from a level that you are not yet. That could be a crash that you shatter you to pieces. Go ask Humpy Dumpty just how he\u0027s doing. \"Small steps are still steps\" -- Cardi B. Its the parent function. \"Done is better then perfect\" -- Common Saying. Everyone may not be trying to get up the mountain. But for the ones that are. It may be at different speeds. At different lengths. Leg widths. But its not (just) about speed. \"Direction over speed\" -- Social Media Post. Its about learning stuff a little something something along the way. \"Go low and slow and you might just fxxk around and learn something about yourself\" -- Youtube Chef. The Best fall off the bone beefs are cooked low and slow. Especially for hard cuts. Although sometimes youre slowly being boiled alive. SO sometimes youve got to turn the fire on high. In order to get the frog to jump out of the water. Reference My library Mrs. J told me this. How do you cook a frog in boiling water?? Without a lid on it?? Low and slow. It gets comfortable. And then it lowly dies. But if you put the water on blasting high. Then the frog will // is much more likely to jump out. Frogs can save themselves. So alot of the times it no that you do not have the tools. Its just that youve been made to comfortable in toxic deadly situations. Why did you get comfortable in a place that you knew that you were supposed to leave? Who enabled whom?? When was the deadline and why didnt you listen? How many times did you hit snooze on your exit strategy?? Yes you can be learning something and at the same time long term saving yourself. But the differenceis healthy and//or unhealthy environment ?? Is it fresh air or cigarette smoke?? If youre a smoker that quit smoking but yet you still sit in the smokers section are you better, stagnant and//or worst for it?? Worst for it. Second hand smoke is actually more harmful then first hand smoking. I think. If not factual my point still remains. You do not thaw out in the place where you froze; especially if you can avoid it. You do not heal where you broke. So many celebrities end up bringing in their families who some times they ran away from because the lime light got to be too much. Abusive Daycare. Conditioned for abuse. Then preyed on and sent to an environment that will normalize and maintain and //or have you maintaining your conditions for abuse. As part of the normalized social construct. And you may think that youre winning when really you could just be another frog in slowly boiling water. Think on that metaphor. Anyways thats all Ive got for now. \"Save half for harvest\" -- THB.

  "Music review 4 Today’s song:stronger by Kanye west Positives: One of the catchiest beats and is a prime example on how to property sample. Kanye’s flow goes with the beat very well The music video is so interesting. I’m often just vibing not paying attention to it, so I always end up finding something I didn’t see before. The vibe Kanye gives of is at its peak in this song.  Seriously the daft punk sample is incredible it’s genius how well it fits a rap beat. Just shows Kanye’s genius he sometimes has.  This song literally defined and revolutionized the music industry at its time. Negatives: it actually has none. I’m nit picky most of the time but I can’t find any major flaws It’s a 10/10 Easily one of the best songs of all time . At least of this century so far.",

  "@@brainrotquizzer Hello. Just wanted to let you know that Jesus loves you very much. He is coming back very soon and He wants you to be ready.  Just go to Him as you are. You don’t have to be perfect. The only thing He requires is a full surrender of your life. Go to Him and give Him your life and everything. Once you surrender everything (from the heart). He will give you The Holy Spirit in His fullness. The Holy Spirit will then give you faith, the power to overcome sin, peace, fulfillment and above all, eternal life. You cannot do it on your own strength. It’s only by the Holy Spirit. And you get The Holy Spirit once you lay everything down, including your life at The Lord’s feet. He says in His Word “Not by might, not by power but by my Spirit”.  People think Christianity is boring. That’s because they see it as a religion. Christianity is not a religion, but a personal relationship with Jesus Christ who loves you and gave Himself for you. Having a relationship with Christ is the most joyful fulfilling thing you can ever have. Jesus changed my life and He wants to change yours as well. The reason we are all here is to fellowship with and have a relationship with God.",

  "@@EzioBliss if you\u0027re talking about the 2000s, Human After All nominated for Grammy. Discovery is often regarded as the game-changer for EDM and music in general. Hell, Alive 2007, the live album, won a Grammy. That live performance is often quoted as the start of massive and full of LED DJ performance. Daft Punk started it with those pyramids. Even nowadays, only a few could come close to Alive 2007 performance. Think of acts that wear mask/helmets like Deadmau5 and Marshmello. It all started with Daft Punk robotic outfit. Daft Punk is often regarded as the best DJ/producers in the EDM culture.",
  "@@jeppyjep Well your words kinda proving my point here. \u0027Alive\u0027 happened in November. This song released 4 months before. Ain\u0027t saying it had anything to do about that but there are differences between Popular culture and Electronic dance music. Maybe Solti or Quincy comparison was far fetched. Lets try again with Walter Murphy and his 70s disco number \u0027A fifth of Beethoven\u0027. Hippies almost had forgot about Beethoven during that \u0027Me decade\u0027. Yet Beethoven\u0027s music got introduced to a new culture and it worked. His fans always existed, just the number had increased. Same happened with Hip Hop and EDM. You can\u0027t deny early 2k ruled by Hip Hop. Personally I would pick Daft Punk over Kanye. Discovery and Random Access Memory are two of my favourite album. However, that wouldn’t change the fact that \u0027Stronger\u0027 worked even better for Daft Punk. We can all see the engagement here, which is more than HBFS, quite significantly.",

  "HARDER BETTER FASTER STRONGER! The SpaceX Starship is the biggest toughest rocket ever built. With its hardened 30X stainless steel it is also the strongest. The fact that it can hold over 100 people and over a hundred tons means not only can we travel comfortably but bring most of our equipment with us. The Raptor engines that power the starship use methylux which can be produced in volumes on most planets we would land upon. We will be constantly innovating our fleet of Starships for more comfort and reliability. Much thanks to Elon Musk, SpaceX and NASA for making this possible. This is the time! This is the place and we are the people that will change the world! Shoot for the Moon and Mars and then we will end up amongst the Stars!",
  "First of all I would like to be one of the many to thank Elon Musk for his leadership, determination and all of his efforts of helping humanity clean up our environment with sustainable energy programs. Also with his commitment of SpaceX to allow the exploration of space for future colonization. Our world is a fragile place that currently holds all of humanities eggs in one basket. By spreading our wings and being able to leave our nest we will ensure that human consciousness will live on outside of our planet. I was asked by A very wise man in the early 2000s if I had millions of dollars to help humanity, what would the most important innovations be in business for all of humanity? I knew that the petroleum industries were polluting our air water and food to the point that people were getting sick and dying of diseases, from those major fossil fuel pollutants. As we talked further and further about electric vehicles, transportation, solar power and other sustainable energies. He said, \"I think you\u0027re right and it should be done!\" He as well had been pondering that question. Trying to be thorough though, he asked if anything else should be focused on for all of humanity? I said, \"Yes and in case of a global disaster whether it be climatic, an asteroid strike or another WORLD WAR, I suggest that space exploration and colonization also be considered to prevent the collapse of human consciousness as we know it!\" Thinking back all of those years almost seems like a deja vu to where we are today. Again I can\u0027t think of anyone else but Elon that would put all of their FORTUNE on the line for the best of humanity. With his consistant focus and extremely innovative leadership, he is leading the world out of darkness and into the light of the rest of our universe. So much yet to learn and do but thanks to the lead of people like Elon we can be stepping in the right direction. We all have more in us to offer the rest of the world. So let\u0027s do it! This is the time and we are the people that will change the world! For those of you who like these ideas or have some of your own to offer, please let me know. I appreciate all of you and your comments. Let\u0027s shoot for the Moon and Mars then we will end up amongst the Stars!  propower101@hotmail.com",

Hats off to Kanye for being a big part of that influence.

  "You are made in the Image of the Living God. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. If you\u0027ve lied, lusted, stolen, killed, were blasphemous etc., you have sinned and the wages of sin - is death, eternal punishment, separated from the Lord God who created you. Jesus Christ is God the Son and entered into His own Creation and became Flesh. He was born of a virgin and He died on a cross. Nailed my sin there too. Was placed in a grave and rose again on the third day. And now He is at the right Hand of God the Father; making intersession for me, until the day He takes me home. When Jesus Christ rose from the dead, there were many eyewitnesses. Jesus Christ\u0027s resurrection is the most SURE and true thing in all of history!  We are all sinners. We deserve the wrath of God. You are made in the Image of the Living God, so do not harm yourself. Do you know where you will go when you die? Jesus Christ, the Righteous One, died for our sins and rose again, to the right Hand of the Father, so that there is no condemnation for those who believe. Jesus Christ is God the Son and entered into His own creation. Jesus was born of a virgin, died for the sins of all who believe on Him. Jesus Christ defeated all His enemies. He was dead for three days, He defeated death and has the keys to Life and Death. Jesus Christ took care of business. On the cross, our Lord and Savior said \"it is finished\". So it was finished. Amen. Jesus Christ has the keys to Hell. For God so loved the world, that He gave His only BEGOTTEN SON, that whosoever believes on Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life. Jesus Christ rose from the dead three days after His crucifixion, and because He raised Himself from the dead, and the Father raised Him from the dead and the Holy Spirit raised Him from the dead, we who are in Him, shall also be raised on that day of the coming of our Lord and Savior. Imputed righteousness is the righteousness of Jesus Christ credited to the Christian, enabling the Christian to be justified; imparted righteousness is what God does in Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit after justification, working in the Christian to enable and empower the process of sanctification. Hebrews 4:12, KJV: \"For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\" We have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ. All my sins were paid for on Calvary. John 14:6 ESV  Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.\" The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the most factual thing in all of history! A Warning: Galatians 1:8-9 King James Version 8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. 9 As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. \u003c~ Avoid cults Revelation 20:6 “Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.”We will be with God for eternity. Mark 1:15, KJV: \"And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.\" Gospel means good news. You don\u0027t have to come under the wrath of God. Jesus Christ is God. Our Creator. God is Triune. God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. God is One. Three Persons in the Divine and Holy Trinity. God is Holy and True, He is the One against whom you\u0027ve sinned! Repent and believe the Gospel. \"9 If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; 10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by Him doth this man stand here before you whole. 11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. 12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other Name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\" Acts 4:9-12 King James Version NIV Acts 4:9-12 9 If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed, 10 then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. 11 Jesus is  “‘the stone you builders rejected,     which has become the cornerstone.’ 12 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other Name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.\" If you are feeling suicidal, I urge you to consider this, you are made in the Image of the Living God. Do not harm yourself. You are no accident. Jeremiah 1:5 New International Version 5 “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,...\" Spend your life serving the One for whom you were created out of love and store for yourself treasures in Heaven. Do not harm yourself. Your life is not yours to take. John 18:37 New King James Version 37 Pilate therefore said to Him, “Are You a king then?” Jesus answered, “You say rightly that I am a king. For this cause I was born, and for this cause I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.”",

  "After a long day of work, Kanye West goes to his Kanye Nest to take his Kanye Rest. He wakes up feeling his Kanye Best. Then he’ll get Kanye Dressed on his Kanye Vest to go on a Kanye Quest. He goes to church and becomes Kanye Blessed, then to a hotel room to be a Kanye Guest. Then to school to take his Kanye Test. He forgot to brush his teeth. Did he run out of Kanye Crest? His neighbor stole it, what a Kanye Pest. He then puts on some axe for some Kanye zest and goes to the bar puffing out his Kanye chest. Gets drunk into a Kanye mess and goes home to the the Kanye West part of town. He realized his life was a wreck, and was feeling a little Kanye depressed. “My life sucks he Kanye digressed. He decided to get some Italian to he flew to Kanye Trieste. He got some pasta and started to Kanye digest. You should get some Kanye rest his wife Kanye pressed. Instead he went to a Kanye fest. He then realized he needed to go to Dallas for his competition, so he went to the airport and hopped on Kanye southwest, got some Kanye rest, and the next morning was feeling ready for his Kanye contest. Or at least he Kanye guessed. On the day of the competition he was feeling a little Kanye stressed. But in the end the judges were Kanye impressed. For his performance he was awarded with the Kanye chest, clearly identified with the Kanye crest. There ends the story of Kanye West.",

This song is all about the good vs. the bad. One minute you\u0027re focused, the next meeting you are distracted. One minute you are planning for great things, next minute you are wallowing in your sorrows. The beat is from Japan! The artwork is from Russia 🇷🇺 the instrumental is from the superb Dutch producer 🇳🇱 the lyrics are from America 🇺🇸and the temptation is from Germany🇩🇪 , so I hope that you enjoy the show!

  "There\u0027s no question that Kanye\u0027s a genius! The only problem is that he\u0027s aware of it. No genius should be aware of it, it gives them an inflated ego. They start to think they never have a bad idea. Growing up, I was told how much of a genius I am and it hindered me in the long run. I never took notes or carried my textbooks with me in school. It caused me to lack vital organizational skills that would\u0027ve been drilled into me in school. I memorized the information I needed from my textbooks and left tgem at home because I decided to see if ibwas as smart as everyone told me I was.",

Before Kanye rap was just about being a gangster in the street and rapping abo it drugs and women but when Kanye dropped his first album he proved that you don’t have to act tough to get big you can be a open minded and emotional person. Also. Compare Kanye west albums to whatever other rap was playing during these times.  Everyone else was still kinda doing the gangster shit while Kanye is over here doing electronica lol 😂",

  "I spent a majority of my youth pretending to be someone I wasn’t. I wanted so desperately to be cool, to be noticed, to be liked..I didn’t like who was staring back at me in the MIRROR. I LIED to sound interesting, I LIED to appear funny, I LIED to get anyone to notice me. I wanted GIRLS to notice me...I was constantly chasing that relationship with ANYONE.. Since 2nd grade, constantly seeking the opposite sex. In 6th grade, I began to think about sex..alot I began to “self satisfy” any chance I got. Looking back at the habits I developed in that mindset...it makes me hang my head in shame. My Grandparents divorced, my parents divorced..it only made sense I was seeking that “intimacy”...any intimacy would do the job.. Habits I developed in my youth, overflowed and poured over into my Adulthood..almost cost me my marriage, my relationship with my children..it almost cost me my LIFE.. 🩸🩸🩸🕊🕊🕊 I don’t write this, in search of pity.. I don’t share this, to tell you a story.. YOU ARE READING THIS RIGHT HERE AND NOW IN THIS MOMENT, because YOU made a choice, to watch this video and scroll through the comments, like you have always done. But this time is different, because THIS is the moment someone brought you the good word 🙏🏽 That there is a God that sits on high, and he is waiting for you. He is waiting for you to lift up the past you’ve let drive your present, up to him! He is waiting for you to pull away from the habitual sin you have been living in! He is waiting for you to shout his name in praise on your darkest nights! He is waiting for you to stop asking the questions that don’t matter, and dig into his word! Waiting for you to take hold of the fact he sent his son to die the death that YOU AND I DESERVE!! Waiting for you to dig into his word for your redemption! The redemption that awaits the vessel developed in love, the vessel with the royal blood of heaven flowing through its veins! This is for you!! The one who couldn’t stare in the mirror, the one who died!! This is for the one that HAS NO OTHER PLACE TO GO..BECAUSE THE LORD OUR GOD FOLLOWS US INTO THE DEEPEST PLACES, THE DARKEST PLACES, JUST TO TELL US HOW MUCH HE LOVES US, AND HAS PLANS TO PROSPER YOU AND TO NEVER HURT YOU!! LOOK INTO THE MIRROR!! LOOK DEEP INTO YOUR OWN EYES!! PREACH TO YOURSELF!! TALK TO YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER AND ACCESS THE PATH THAT LEADS TO HIS GLORY, TO HIS WILL!! Look into the mirror, acknowledging that you have FOUND GOD, and begin your WALK WITH GOD..by developing a relationship with his son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ 🕊🕊🕊 LOOK INTO THE MIRROR... And start the habit of seeing YOURSELF, the way GOD SEES YOU.. Created in his image, beautifully made, for MEANING AND PURPOSE  🕊🕊🕊🩸🩸🩸 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽Glory be to God!!🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 If you have read this far, God bless you, if you have a few minutes listen to my NEW song “Mirror Image” on my page. Shut down everything else and join me as I  share many of the thoughts that I had with MYSELF, while looking into the mirror.. Join me as I talk to the man staring back at me, my MIRROR IMAGE 🕊🩸🙏🏽 🎤🎤🎤",

Sometimes we need help in the form of medication, spiritual nutrition, atonement and we always need love. GOD is love so put His works into play. Faith without works is dead and You will prevail ! You are active in all the right ways !! You will be stronger ! You will succeed !! Despite all or whom You have lost, we know that the best is yet to come.

But to say ANYTHING by Kanye is the greatest of all time is insane. NOTHING he has done even holds a candle to Eminem. Nor am I really trying to discredit electronic or rap music. But I\u0027m being real. Playing an instrument is not something just anyone can do. ANYONE can push buttons as it doesn\u0027t require any physical strength. Try playing a Metallica song on guitar or drums, and get back to me about skill. I know GREAT guitarists and drummers who still can\u0027t play some of their songs.

I’m very into that early 2000s pop punk/alternative rock scene. But I can also go to Eminem, then Metallica, then Depeche Mode and even The Beach Boys and the Beatles. If you think MCR is all I listen to you’re sorely mistaken lmao. It’s not like I’m bumping Taylor Swift. I don’t normally bump Kanye either, he’s a dick. Some songs of his do go hard though but yeah I’ve never listened to an album of his.",

Even the beat is unchanged from \u0027Cola Bottle Baby\u0027. Kanye added a lot of elements to it like his own beat, synths, new outro, rapped over it, and used only a short sequence of the song for his sample unlike Daft Punk who lifted practically the entire song from Edwin Birdsong.",
  "@@t.h8919 ok cool",
  "@@5ivestar65 The irony here is that Daft Punk sampled Edwin Birdsong so closely, you could call their song a cover of \u0027Cola Bottle Baby\u0027. So they contributed almost nothing to their OWN song. And I love Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger and Daft Punk in general so no hate there.",

No doubt graduation is a masterpiece, it’s some of his best work in my eyes and it’s absolutely iconic and influenced the industry, but personally for me and a lot of others kayne never seemed to decline, I just think of it as his style simply just changing and evolving with each different album in a unique way, and that’s why people call him a genius musician.

He himself has implied and stated on numerous occasions that he no longer supports trump. A few minutes of research instead of making shit up will save you the trouble. On the other hand trump throwing money at the Black community does not fix the issues, I wish y’all would get that bs out your head. It’s evident you don’t understand what the Black community needs. Please stop speaking.",

Well if this take away from my spins Which\u0027ll probably take away from my ends Then I hope this take away from my sins And bring the day that I\u0027m dreaming about Next time I\u0027m in the club everybody screaming out God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down (Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me) The only thing that I pray is that me feet don\u0027t fail me now",

  "Well haven\u0027t they given up yet. The fear sweeping across the globe now in a last effort attempt to reel back I the waken awareness of the humanity. Fear- The lowest human emotional vibrational frequency we use in their world. The frequency high they absorb from it. It is getting more and more difficult for them to keep those lizard skins hidden. Sometimes you don\u0027t have to find something to talk about. You don\u0027t have to wait for the voice in your head. It just shows up and throws it in your face. Like the eugenics puppet controlled media. Part of your mind or someone\u0027s mind. Says that everyone of these creatures should be rounded up and put on trial. Followed by the quick and speedy execution of capital punishment or life in prison without possibility of parole. This includes those of them performing it, the politicians permitting it, the main stream media deceiving it, the oversite safety committee\u0027s ignoring it, the involved medical professionals explaining it, and those, those only concerned with milking the material preventive demands in medical supplies with greasy spoons. Whatever side of the road cash hijacking system they plan to set up to ring some kind of vermin profit off it. Can be left to the fate of vermin. Once the plunder leaves town and all that\u0027s remains are wide empty wastes with no more occupied homes. Where nothing lives and deep bits of wet stinking death assured hot weather swimming pools for their stunted hillbilly heroin addicted children. Corollary Incidentals always appear in tandem with these things and even members of the socio-political retard army can see the connection, but what\u0027s the fun or profit in that. Isn\u0027t it just better to just let the sh-t go on and get all righteous and weepy about the back end drowning in a rain of hypocritical tears as you mourn the loss of so many corporate meetings caused by psychological human behavioral doctors from the Project Paperclip Gestapo. Brought to them by the decent hard working victims of Corporate illegal targeted harassment of them in the work place. The people doing these things are the spiritual offspring of serial killers and mass murdering psychopaths. They know what they are doing and know what happens, but it just doesn\u0027t matter and maybe at this point it doesn\u0027t. Most of the population now is in bed with it at some level. Some are just sleeping in better accomodations. Some of them have even had their own idea of environmental awareness and the love of nature, and some of them are into consciousness improving retreats where they can take a few minutes to rationalize it all and come to peace with it. Of course if it comes to peace  about it with them is another story. Once the sleepwalking wide load expanding sh-t for brains consumer zombies can really obsolutely no longer put food on their families tables. Also those who haven\u0027t been matriculated to another world by their murderous and insane progeny or a temporary beserker state of the head of the house hold. Maybe some relative comes back from foreign killing fields who can\u0027t live with themselves or you anymore. Once it finally dawns on them and they have to go live in their car and they can\u0027t afford the gas to run the heater in their car and winter comes in order to take a nice monoxide nap prior to a morning that never arrives. When they meant with good intensions to head down to the old slurpy factory to see if they were taking day time laborers, it\u0027s possible. It\u0027s possible that enough of them will get together and storm their houses of government and drag the toads, lampreys, and pigs from their paneled offices and dispense the justice they should of got a long time before, but there is no telling how it will all sort out. It won\u0027t sort out well in most places, it\u0027s pretty much a given. Those that are getting just what they deserve from the government they deserve will keep on nodding their heads like plastic bobbing flamingos on eyeball glasses. While whatever inferno alien in chief that runs their slice of Idiocracy goes on and on about recovery and a return to the good life they never had to begin with, meanwhile all those human size ticks operating with bureaucratic dictionaries and as-holes with guns and clipboards will be going around knocking on doors exercising edictson and informing the residents that one more thing they took for granted and once considered a right has now become illegal. Not only has it become illegal, but the law will clearly state that they should of known what they didn\u0027t know. Ending it with at least one member of the household now has to be dragged out onto the front lawn and impaled on a flaming spike as a warning to their neighbors. It\u0027s not like they don\u0027t lack the courage and conviction at some level because just as soon as whatever cold blooded oger entity who runs the joint tells their leaders that some country somewhere has to be turned into a smouldering open air graveyard they will endo gladly deliver their children to the task. Heck if they\u0027re still in any kind of shape given they have no job anyway, they\u0027ll go too. Meanwhile the wife can run some hard sheet split level home to cover whatever taxes and penalties might insure for whatever reason the thieves in power create to aquire it. This probably sounds like satire or sarcasm to some and terrorism to others, but it\u0027s all true. It   might look and play out a little differently but the results will be the same and something very like all of it is going on all over the place right now. Perhaps though you can\u0027t see that. It is all together possible. You won\u0027t be hearing about it where you get your news and you won\u0027t be reading about it here. I\u0027m sure the heinous empires of Rockefeller and Rothschild along with all those other names so well known to some of us would of long ago met they\u0027re well deserved fate at the hands of the mob, possibly even the hands of a creative patient and fiendishly ingenious mob. Except for the magic powers they wield that keep their lizard-skin bodies in tact. It doesn\u0027t take a whole lot of inquiry and imagination to figure out they have the protection of certain entities brought forth by a bloody rites and rituals of human sacrafice, small children preferred to maintain they\u0027re diabolical activities. Most of this is low end sh-t but we live in a low end Yuga so that all makes sense. Every member of the walking wounded probably knows by now that Wall Street and the city are a cancer as great as anything Kasheshima might of deliver and that they run the governments, and whatever the governments have been doing to them comes at the order of these demon cabals. It would of never gotten this far if so many people hadn\u0027t wanted to become lawyers in their employ, hired guns in their protection, doctors in their service of disease, scientists in the service of plaque fueled pandemic and eugenics of euthanasia. office workers who produce and ferry all manner of official papers for the promise of a particular paper confinement specialists who would rather be out then in. Even though their confinement has just defined in another way. It wouldn\u0027t of gotten this far if most of the entertainers, artists, writers, musicians, and self-deluded Victims of bad inspiration hadn\u0027t decided the best career move was to sell out the promise of everything that they might of been and done. For a corporate tattoo on their as- which they can display to the world during their moments of buggery and bacchanalia in the ultimate public performance art that all of this leads to. There\u0027s nothing like state and culturally sanctioned masterbation that you can do anywhere at any time because baby you have that right. You don\u0027t have to worry about joining a crowd, they will be there and just as turned on as you are. Thousands of cell phone cameras will be clicking or videotaping, ansirtube will be waiting, just anticipating. Well you won\u0027t have to worry about the things you will never ever possess because possession is assured. This is the time of the habitation of demons and everyone gets to be a timeshare or a permanent resident although the former doesn\u0027t usually exist unless you get really f-cking lucky. STEP Right up, yeah. Everybody\u0027s a WINNER. Don\u0027t ASK WHY THE RINGS don\u0027t go over the bottles and THE BALLS DON\u0027T GO IN THE NET. They wouldn\u0027t call it a TRICK if you could see what was happening. What do you know isn\u0027t that LADY GAGA on the carnival speakers. They\u0027ve all come to see the freaks. Well no worries there, freaks you will have. Especially, when night falls. She doesn\u0027t call them mommies little monsters for nothing nor will little be the case. Sure satire, sarcasm,or terrorism as you preffer, it all becomes something different  anyway. When you check into the roach motel at the end of the universe and you don\u0027t have to go any real distance. There\u0027s one real close by. It\u0027s a franchise and that\u0027s just what they call it. Something like putting the glimmer of romance on your already bought and sold a-s. They don\u0027t really need to do that. You already gave it up with out romance ever entering into the equation. Meanwhile, while there\u0027s still time for you to wake up and get pissed off and still time for you to do something about it. Certain forms of crown control will be employed. Even if only inside your head. You should know that isn\u0027t all you\u0027re going to get. Think about other times like this. Remember this is the time when they let all those appetites loose. You do have to remember they don\u0027t just do it for the profit. They do it for the entertainment to. Take a look at the way you came and what happened around you on the way. Even if it didn\u0027t happen to you yet. EVEN if IT DIDN\u0027T GET around TO YOU YET. You don\u0027t have to think to hard about what that means.  You don\u0027t have to worry to hard about waking up or sleeping through it either. It isn\u0027t nearly as fun for them unless they can wake you up to be part of the experience. Even If that\u0027s all the awakening you prove cable of.",

  "Mike Strypes “sampling” is the understatement of the century. If DP wanted to sue him I’m sure they could. If you really want to call it a sample, then compare it to most songs that sample. This is so blatantly obvious. It’s definitely closer to a cover with some rap, which itself isn’t even original — “what doesn’t kill me makes me stronger” — yeah... compare to Beyonce’s sample of the chi-lites riff for crazy in love. That made sense and probably would be protected from suit by fair use because it was used briefly during the song for transitions. The DP riff is being played constantly throughout this and sometimes on its own without even any Kanye on top of it. Another example would be Pitbull’s feel this moment, sampling A-ha. Their riff was used throughout the song, but slowed down tremendously. This probably would not be covered as sufficiently transformative for fair use, but I do know for a fact that they got permission from take on me’s copyright holder. I have to assume that Kanye did the same, or this video wouldn’t stay up for 10+ years now",

  "Orlando Vides It’s Edwin birdsong of course, but daft punk remade it and added their own vocals, the vocals are daft punks and that’s the main sample that’s used in the song, which was created by Guy Manuel and Thomas Bangalter",
  "@frak I wasn’t trying to flex, but it kinda makes me sad as a producer that Daft Punk got fairly unrecognized by Kanye’s fanbase, I guess the main point of my comment was just that behind every song there’s usually an insanely talented producer that goes completely unrecognized, and the singer usually gets all the recognition, albeit the producer usually makes more money but still",

  "rose boy, Yeah sure, but the majority of the melody and base for the song lies in that vocal sample, he did produce a good amount of it and put it in a different key, but the memorable part of the song lies in the vocal sample, and it’s fair to say that most people know the “harder better faster stronger” sample from either this or daft punk, but if you just started rapping the Kanye lyrics you’re much less likely to hear an “oh I know that song” than if you did the vocal sample",

Those people crossed illegally into the Country and were probably just put into holding until can process all information on them and make sure their parents are actually their parents (sadly is a lot of child trafficking in the world) I don\u0027t see the problem with any of this especially when Americans themselves are being taken away from their families and put into even smaller \"cages\" every single day, I was arrested numerous times and placed under arrest, put into a cage and seperated from my family when I was growing up yet nobody gave 0 fucks so gtfo with your dumb shit.

THEIR WORSHIP OF ME IS BASED ON MERELY HUMAN RULES THEY HAVE BEEN TAUGHT.* *ISAIAH **29:15** WOE TO THOSE WHO GO TO GREAT DEPTHS TO HIDE THEIR PLANS FROM THE LORD, WHO DO THEIR WORK IN DARKNESS AND THINK, “WHO SEES US? WHO WILL KNOW?”* *1 TIMOTHY **4:13** UNTIL I COME, DEVOTE YOURSELF TO THE PUBLIC READING OF SCRIPTURE, TO PREACHING AND TO TEACHING.* *1 TIMOTHY **4:16** WATCH YOUR LIFE AND DOCTRINE CLOSELY. PERSEVERE IN THEM, BECAUSE IF YOU DO, YOU WILL SAVE BOTH YOURSELF AND YOUR  HEARERS.* *1 TIMOTHY 5: SINS OF SOME ARE OBVIOUS, REACHING THE PLACE OF JUDGMENT AHEAD OF THEM; THE SINS OF OTHERS TRAIL BEHIND THEM.* *25 IN THE SAME WAY, GOOD DEEDS ARE OBVIOUS, AND EVEN THOSE THAT ARE NOT OBVIOUS CANNOT REMAIN HIDDEN FOREVER.* *EPHESIANS 5:4 Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.* *5 For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person—such a person is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.* *11 HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FRUITLESS DEEDS OF DARKNESS, BUT RATHER EXPOSE THEM.* 12It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret. 13But everything exposed by the light becomes visible—and everything that is illuminated becomes a light. *19 SPEAKING TO ONE ANOTHER WITH PSALMS, HYMNS, AND SONGS FROM THE SPIRIT. SING AND MAKE MUSIC FROM YOUR HEART TO THE LORD, *20 always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST.* *1 JOHN 4:6 We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us.* *THIS IS HOW WE RECOGNIZE THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH AND THE SPIRIT OF FALSEHOOD.* *EPHESIANS **4:22** You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;* *23 to be made new in the attitude of your minds;* *24 and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.* *PHILIPPIANS **3:15** THEREFORE LET US, AS MANY AS ARE MATURE, HAVE THIS MIND; AND IF IN ANYTHING YOU THINK OTHERWISE, GOD WILL REVEAL EVEN THIS TO YOU.* 17 BRETHREN, JOIN IN FOLLOWING MY EXAMPLE, AND NOTE THOSE WHO SO WALK, AS YOU HAVE US FOR A PATTERN.* *16 NEVERTHELESS, TO THE DEGREE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY ATTAINED, LET US WALK BY THE SAME RULE, LET US BE OF THE SAME MIND.* *1 THESSALONIANS **5:21** BUT TEST THEM ALL; HOLD ON TO WHAT IS GOOD,* *22 REJECT EVERY KIND OF EVIL.* *2 THESSALONIANS 1:*8 HE WILL PUNISH THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW GOD AND DO NOT OBEY THE GOSPEL OF OUR LORD JESUS.* *9 THEY WILL BE PUNISHED WITH EVERLASTING DESTRUCTION AND SHUT OUT FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD AND FROM THE GLORY OF HIS MIGHT* *10 ON THE DAY HE COMES TO BE GLORIFIED IN HIS HOLY PEOPLE AND TO BE MARVELED AT AMONG ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BELIEVED. THIS INCLUDES YOU, BECAUSE YOU BELIEVED OUR TESTIMONY TO YOU.* *1 THESSALONIANS:2: 3 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:* *4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.* *2 THESSALONIANS 2:9 THE COMING OF THE LAWLESS ONE WILL BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH HOW SATAN WORKS. HE WILL USE ALL SORTS OF DISPLAYS OF POWER THROUGH SIGNS AND WONDERS THAT SERVE THE LIE,* *10 and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.* *11 FOR THIS REASON GOD SENDS THEM A POWERFUL DELUSION SO THAT THEY WILL BELIEVE THE LIE* *12 and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.* *EPHESIANS **4:29** DO NOT LET ANY UNWHOLESOME TALK COME OUT OF YOUR MOUTHS, BUT ONLY WHAT IS HELPFUL FOR BUILDING OTHERS UP ACCORDING TO THEIR NEEDS, THAT IT MAY BENEFIT THOSE WHO LISTEN.* 30And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. *31 GET RID OF ALL BITTERNESS, RAGE AND ANGER, BRAWLING AND SLANDER, ALONG WITH EVERY FORM OF MALICE.* 32Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you. *2 THESSALONIANS **2:15** SO THEN, BROTHERS AND SISTERS, STAND FIRM AND HOLD FAST TO THE TEACHINGS WE PASSED ON TO YOU, WHETHER BY WORD OF MOUTH OR BY LETTER.* *COLASSIANS 3:8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.* *TITUS 2:1 YOU, HOWEVER, MUST TEACH WHAT IS APPROPRIATE TO SOUND DOCTRINE.* *7 IN EVERYTHING SET THEM AN EXAMPLE BY DOING WHAT IS GOOD. IN YOUR TEACHING SHOW INTEGRITY, SERIOUSNESS* *8 AND SOUNDNESS OF SPEECH THAT CANNOT BE CONDEMNED, SO THAT THOSE WHO OPPOSE YOU MAY BE ASHAMED BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT US.* *PHILIPPIANS **2:15** THAT YOU MAY BECOME BLAMELESS AND HARMLESS, CHILDREN OF GOD WITHOUT FAULT IN THE MIDST OF A CROOKED AND PERVERSE GENERATION, among whom you shine as lights in the world,* *2 TOMITHY 4:1 IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND OF CHRIST JESUS, WHO WILL JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD, AND IN VIEW OF HIS APPEARING AND HIS KINGDOM, I GIVE YOU THIS CHARGE:* *2 PREACH THE WORD; BE PREPARED IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON; CORRECT, REBUKE AND ENCOURAGE —WITH GREAT PATIENCE AND CAREFUL INSTRUCTION.* *3 FOR THE TIME WILL COME WHEN PEOPLE WILL NOT PUT UP WITH SOUND DOCTRINE. INSTEAD, TO SUIT THEIR OWN DESIRES, THEY WILL GATHER AROUND THEM A GREAT NUMBER OF TEACHERS TO SAY WHAT THEIR ITCHING EARS WANT TO HEAR.* *4 THEY WILL TURN THEIR EARS AWAY FROM THE TRUTH AND TURN ASIDE TO MYTHS.* *TITUS 6 AN ELDER MUST BE BLAMELESS, FAITHFUL TO HIS WIFE, A MAN WHOSE CHILDREN BELIEVE AND ARE NOT OPEN TO THE CHARGE OF BEING WILD AND DISOBEDIENT.* 7 Since an overseer manages God’s household, he must be blameless—not overbearing, NOT QUICK-TEMPERED, not given to drunkenness, not violent, NOT PURSUING DISHONEST GAIN.* *8 Rather, he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, UPRIGHT, HOLY AND DISCIPLINED.* *9 HE MUST HOLD FIRMLY TO THE TRUSTWORTHY MESSAGE AS IT HAS BEEN TAUGHT, SO THAT HE CAN ENCOURAGE OTHERS BY SOUND DOCTRINE AND REFUTE THOSE WHO OPPOSE IT.* *10 FOR THERE ARE MANY REBELLIOUS PEOPLE, FULL OF MEANINGLESS TALK AND DECEPTION, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF THE CIRCUMCISION GROUP.* *11 THEY MUST BE SILENCED, BECAUSE THEY ARE DISRUPTING WHOLE HOUSEHOLDS BY TEACHING THINGS THEY OUGHT NOT TO TEACH —AND THAT FOR THE SAKE OF DISHONEST GAIN.* 1 TIMOTHY 3:*6 HE MUST NOT BE A RECENT CONVERT, OR HE MAY BECOME CONCEITED AND FALL UNDER THE SAME JUDGMENT AS THE DEVIL.* *7 HE MUST ALSO HAVE A GOOD REPUTATION WITH OUTSIDERS, SO THAT HE WILL NOT FALL INTO DISGRACE AND INTO THE DEVIL’S TRAP. 8 In the same way, deacons are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. *9 THEY MUST KEEP HOLD OF THE DEEP TRUTHS OF THE FAITH WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE.* *PHILIPPIANS **2:12** THEREFORE, MY BELOVED, AS YOU HAVE ALWAYS OBEYED, NOT AS IN MY PRESENCE ONLY, BUT NOW MUCH MORE IN MY ABSENCE, WORK OUT YOUR OWN SALVATION WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING;* *1 TIMOTHY 3:*15 IF I AM DELAYED, YOU WILL KNOW HOW PEOPLE OUGHT TO CONDUCT THEMSELVES IN GOD’S HOUSEHOLD, WHICH IS THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, THE PILLAR AND FOUNDATION OF THE TRUTH.* *1 PETER 3:8 FINALLY, ALL OF YOU, BE LIKE-MINDED, BE SYMPATHETIC, LOVE ONE ANOTHER, BE COMPASSIONATE AND HUMBLE.* *9 DO NOT REPAY EVIL WITH EVIL OR INSULT WITH INSULT. ON THE CONTRARY, REPAY EVIL WITH BLESSING, BECAUSE TO THIS YOU WERE CALLED SO THAT YOU MAY INHERIT A BLESSING.* *10 FOR, “WHOEVER WOULD LOVE LIFE AND SEE GOOD DAYS MUST KEEP THEIR TONGUE FROM EVIL AND THEIR LIPS FROM DECEITFUL SPEECH.* *12 FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE ON THE RIGHTEOUS AND HIS EARS ARE ATTENTIVE TO THEIR PRAYER, BUT THE FACE OF THE LORD IS AGAINST THOSE WHO DO EVIL.”* *1 PETER 4:1 THEREFORE, SINCE CHRIST SUFFERED IN HIS BODY, ARM YOURSELVES ALSO WITH THE SAME ATTITUDE, BECAUSE WHOEVER SUFFERS IN THE BODY IS DONE WITH SIN.* *2 AS A RESULT, THEY DO NOT LIVE THE REST OF THEIR EARTHLY LIVES FOR EVIL HUMAN DESIRES, BUT RATHER FOR THE WILL OF GOD.* *3 FOR YOU HAVE SPENT ENOUGH TIME IN THE PAST  DOING WHAT PAGANS CHOOSE TO DO —LIVING IN DEBAUCHERY, LUST, DRUNKENNESS, ORGIES, CAROUSING AND DETESTABLE IDOLATRY.*",

People act like sampling is lazy and uninspired, but the production on this track is insane; the subtle slowing down of HBFS\u0027s tempo to match the beat, the interpolation of the original \"NEVER\" in his own lyrics and just the insanely sick flow with sharp lyrics. All of these things Kanye did on his own. HBFS serves as nothing more than a beat in this track.",
  "SKOOFADOODLE that’s made up, harder better faster stronger came out in 2001",
  "I honestly feel like this one is better. It feels more fast pace as it has a harder beat and overall sounds darker in tone, while the original Daft Punk song was more or less just a 90s sounding party song. But I think it’s best to respect both Kanye and Daft Punk for working together to make an epic song rather than just saying it belongs to only one or the other.",

  "LokiWasHere that’s true, but I’m saying I don’t like when people can’t tell the difference between the two songs because they’ve only heard stronger. Because it never said daft punk helped, no one who listens to this will ever know that “harder better faster stronger” even existed. I just wish they had been given more credit, so that way people who haven’t listened to them, know who they are",

Think about it, any thing that happens nowadays, kanye seems to be involved. But its not like hes trying to dictate us, but instead give us leadership. In the early 2010s, he gave us power, and wanted us to unite as people to be powerful. Now, when he dresses up like a water bottle or does something funny, it is to lighten the mood on society. Im not saying this because i saw a sign or something, theres just no way kanye is a normal person. There has to be something going on and i cant be the only one thinking this. Everything he does cant be him deciding to do it, its the government telling him to do it. I know the kanye for president was a joke a few years ago, but was it a joke, or is he already our leader? You decide whether you want to live in your own world, or join me in embracing a world of kanye’s.",
