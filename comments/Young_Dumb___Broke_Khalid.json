  "Ember here: So, probably ridiculous what I am doing here. Commenting on multiple of the songs I heard in the concert, but, ah, well. Someone might actually see. ;-) Anyway, so I really loved when that song was so early into the concert last week. I always liked the message of this song, but now that I actually heard the band live? Heard what the singer commented in-between? It means more. I am genuinely happy for them that they are the ones that are able to stand in front of the crowd and share their songs. I am sure it is hard. Tiring. Taxing. They do it anyway though and they appear to do it with heart. While I was certainly not clapping with a nosebleed, I honestly, genuinely wish all of them that they can not only perform but actually enjoy each of their songs. They sounded, from what little I heard, like they deserve it. Mind you, I am the kind of person, who wishes everyone the best, but they are people I can respect not only as muscians but as individuals. Ash, who was with me there at the concert and is completely blind, has a better ear for music. I on the other hand prefer to listen to the message behind the songs, the way they are sung, the way the instruments are played and the emotion behind it. What is said and how it is said. While even there she sometimes catches more than me, it is what truly sticks with me.  I am one person among many. One comment among thousands or even millions. Yet, I still want to tell imagine dragons as a whole and the singer in particular that I truly appreciate and heard the passion they put in the songs. And that what they said about depression truly resonated with me. My utmost respect for being so honest and saying it with so much conviction. Those were words many needed to hear. Thank you for saying them. They may have saved lives and certainly made me smile. You guys were wonderful live and should be proud of what you do! \u003c3",

  "Pourquoi interdire la peine de mort dans un pays ? La vie est sacrée est elle ne doit pas être interrompue totalement par l’autre. Tuer est l’acte le pire qui existe. Pour stopper l’ignorance de cet acte, c’est important de comprendre ce qui suit : Réagir de manière violente à une première violence, c’est créer encore plus de violence. Ne peux pas tuer qui dénonce le meurtre.  De plus, pour stopper cette chaîne de violence, qui peut être sans fin si le meurtre n’est pas interdit, c’est indispensable même pour les autorités du pays d’interdire le meurtre car sinon la vengeance continuera de famille en famille ou d’individu(e)s voulant se venger d’un meurtrier et qui deviendra à son tour un meurtrier. L’amour est toujours plus fort que la violence sinon la vie n’existerait pas sur notre planète. L’amélioration de la paix est possible que par la compréhension et donc l’éducation de la plus grande majorité possible d’une population. Je t’aime :)   \"Alors que les démocraties occidentales abolissent la peine de mort chacune à son tour, la Cour suprême des États-Unis semble mettre la fédération dans la tendance, en déclarant par cinq voix contre quatre dans l\u0027arrêt Furman v. Georgia de 1972[56] que la peine de mort viole la constitution. Mais seuls deux juges concluent à l\u0027interdiction inconditionnelle de la peine capitale en toutes circonstances. Les trois autres juges condamnent la sentence uniquement pour ce cas particulier. Les juges retiennent la façon arbitraire dont la peine a été prononcée. \"",

  "Despite being an avid Imagine Dragons fan, (my friend side eyeing me the whole concert because I was screeching every song word for word) I never used to like this one song, purely because it was overplayed, especially by P.E teachers and the chorus was repetitive. But I just went to see their concert in cinemas today and it changed my whole perspective on it. Dan was singing \"never give up\" at the end of the track and it brought tears to my eyes. I did actually cry several times bc Dan is just so lovely and inspirational, he saved my life without knowing it last year. When I got home I made a playlist of the setlist to make the feeling last a little longer and listened to this song second and it turns out \"never give up\" 2:42 was always in the song, wtf?? Dan, I fucking love you. Idc what people say about imagine dragons being cringey, I had the best day today and shed so many happy years just because I felt heard.",

  "In terms of music I hate this group tbh. Not gonna dwell on it for now, but this song has been there as background noise for so much of my life that it actually pisses me off. I mean it\u0027s kinda fitting that such an ass song would end up so consistently there for me, so now I actually appreciate it for that. A lot of people, in fact everyone I\u0027d say sort of lives like they\u0027re the main character, but I\u0027m especially guilty of this, and always have been. I live like I\u0027m the main character of a tragic comedy or parody art film about our world (or my world I guess) and it\u0027s honestly pretty embarassing. The fact my world is so small and slow moving, or at least has been for most of my life, makes it impossible to shake this feeling. This song honestly makes me reflect on my entire life in such a beautiful way, I can\u0027t deny it\u0027s wormed it\u0027s way into having a special place in my heart.",

Capitulo 1. 2079, junho 19 Th. Sttutgart, Germany. Em uma manhã fria de inverno, a geada estava presente pela vegetação enquanto Walker ia à \"escola\" onde via o pessoal assistindo a uma peça disfarçada de propaganda política no teatro da escola. Walker via aquilo como se fosse algo tão real, mas tão real que tal não parecia real. Aproximou-se de seus colegas e sentou-se sobre um pedaço de madeira duma árvore que cairá pelas proximidades. Logo ele ouve uma voz aguda a desenrolar de sua boca uma música com termos que Walker, pelo menos na época, não o conhecia. Ele estava confuso, porém certo de que aquilo era forjado. ( 05/01/2025). Quando a peça acabou, foi para a aula de pensamento \"crítico\", onde encontrará professores sem diploma nem experiência. Queria o partido controlar tal erro? Ou estava a remediar?",

I was lightning before the thunder\".  \"Thunder\" was released in 2017 as the second single from Imagine Dragons\u0027 third studio album, Evolve. The song\u0027s music video was filmed in Dubai and features the band\u0027s lead singer, Dan Reynolds, singing and dancing among aliens.",

  "The lyrics of \"Thunder\" by Imagine Dragons capture the journey of someone who feels different and refuses to conform to societal expectations. The narrator describes feeling like an outsider (\"Not a \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 not a follower\") and dreaming of \"bigger things,\" even when others mock or underestimate them. The \"lightning before the thunder\" imagery highlights the narrator\u0027s inner potential and ambition that might be unnoticed until it suddenly strikes with impact, like a storm. The recurring \"thunder\" represents the arrival of success or recognition after a period of being overlooked or dismissed. In the second verse, the narrator reflects on their school days, where they were laughed at while dreaming of making a difference for a larger audience. Now, they\u0027ve reached a stage of success, with those who once doubted them cheering from afar (\"in the nosebleeds\"). The song’s underlying message is about perseverance and self-belief, showing that even if people doubt or dismiss you, staying true to your dreams and pushing through can lead to eventual success. The repetition of \"never give up\" in the bridge reinforces this motivational tone, encouraging listeners to keep striving toward their aspirations, even in the face of opposition.",

I was freely... given the ability... to write my own history... I no longer want to build a legacy... but to carry... the W E I G H T..  That was left here for my responsibility... all a man has is his W O R D... so please don\u0027t push me... just to want every w o r d to be right... cause I meant every O N E... technically... I D o n t... have to marry thee... cause If you remember we... already you was with me.. in place where there\u0027s true unity.. Call it what ever you want it to be...heaven or hell or purgatory... I hope you remember baby... what I said before I had to leave... you will never lose me... because beautifully put together through His L O V E.. you gave me the opportunity... to live in eternty... which has always been you... I used to get eternity confused... now I use it to enter gratefully back to thee... I\u0027m like a monkey...  in a tree... climbing to the top... just to put myself back in the pot... I\u0027m on bended knee... could you crown me and raise me to my feet... to compassionatlly row nurturing for our seed... to become better than they could ever see thierself be... baby so tell me... I know your scared as me... but are you ready... to achieve... what we were always predestination to be...Will you be my W. I. F. E... SAVE ME FROM ME...I NEED YOUR ACCOUNTABILITY...",

  "I love this music video for a number of reasons (mostly just because I freaking love this song), but one thing about it has always felt kind of lacking about it: of the three aliens, the dude in black is the only one who seems to actually be dancing along with the music. The dude in white and the lady, while excellent contortionists, just don\u0027t do a whole lot aside from making their arms do crazy sh*t. It just makes it feel a little unbalanced. Admittedly this isn\u0027t at all important, lol, it\u0027s just a 3-minute music video, but the difference makes it so that I\u0027m more entertained when the dude in black is on screen than the others. Hell, the lead singer feels like he\u0027s more in sync with the music, and he\u0027s just punching and kicking. XD",

Also I’m thinking how he and his wife totally formed a band called Egyptian and it makes me totally think of Pharaoh Psusenne And how he should really be the 17th pharaoh in the golden parade featured in 2021 in Egypt at Cairo an Susanne he means the star appearing in the city.  Psusenne he should be number 17 in the lineup because of the Taro cards in the major arcana which lines up with the golden Parade in Egypt as well as the card depicting the sign constellation of Aquarius which is the number 17 also.  And that leads me to the motherboard of being the computer program called [Aquarius] which is BASIC in BASIC programming. 😂",

  "I got in more first fights in highschool than most people get into in their life. All I ever did was work out from wake up, to weight training class, to football practice, to going home and leaving homework in the back pack to hit the weights in the garage. I already had a karate background. What I grew into is what you see in this video. Knowledge and hunger (drive) is power.  Tip toe into life with velvet gloves on. Tread lightly, all the while digging ferociously into learning and training in the dark... Bev your own motivation. Need no one to assist you. Nobody should be on your level. Set the bar in life. Pioneer your own path. You know what you want, leave no room for runners up. Shut down all lanes. No competition. You know what you want in life.  Be the 1. The only one. You know what it takes. Make it your life mantra. Live eat and breath it. Sleep only enough but don\u0027t rest till you have what you want",

He left the month of my birthday and my mum died. He came back and took things as well and left all his junk and knew I already had enough stuff of my own.  He left me in a unstable living situation in which my own sister has been able to help me since mum finally passed.  I have more dignity today in my 50s than in my past.  I\u0027m with a 47 yr old and im 56. Didn\u0027t think you could meet half decent men on Tinder anymore as ive literally run the gauntlet with to many apps as I was lonely after ex left and met an even worse man after him who i got rid of as he wanted to move into where I am now and take over as he did in my previous place but I said no and he dumped me thank god.
