  "Benson Boone if you see this comment this song when I heard it and it blew my mind I’ve never went to your concert. I’m sorry if it hurt your feelings like anybody just pray that I get not so depressed about this. This comment was very special.❤❤❤❤❤ Benson Boone, the song reminds and and every time I hear it it reminds me of my dog. She got ran over on Highway 30 here in the USA. I don’t think I was even born after I was born when I got like seven or six my mom told me and my dad told me she got ran over a Highway 30 here in the USA I’m crying right now after I heard this and kept on it. She was a very special guy. Her name was prissy I had a dog named husky, but he’s still alive and I don’t think he’s a husky dog. He’s a German Shepherd not a German Shepherd a Australian Shepherd and just pray this song makes me cry every time I was here sitting working because I do school. I’m not a homeschool my real school like I get I had this name is this teacher Ashley Garrett she was the nicest teacher you’re just pray❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ yo do not screenshot this in please.

  "My guy best-friend said he didn\u0027t want to by friend with me anymore because someone lied to him about me. A little backstory, we have been friends for about 5-6 years and we were like siblings. We told each other literally everything and trusted each other. A person ( we\u0027ll call her Valentina) wanted to be friends with my friend. Now i was ok with because I\u0027m not that type of person to be like \"No you cant be friends with him he\u0027s only my friend\". But she really jealous of me because us being friends. (Back to where we were before) She she had made up really fake message between me and her (I didn\u0027t even have her number) and showed my friend. He would of not believed it but he has very very bed trust issues like me so he believed her. When he told me what happened, he was sad and mad and wouldn\u0027t even let me talk. I remember him saying \" I can\u0027t believe you would even do that i really trusted you and you go do that? Don\u0027t talk to me anymore\" and i went home crying. 2 years later we are in 10th grade (this all happened in 8th) and when i see him walking in the hallway with the person who lied on me, i get sad a little and thought back to when we were friends.    I know it\u0027s not that same as everyone else stories but to me it felt to same as losing some super close to you in just a blink of a eye.",

  "I\u0027m still holding onto everything that\u0027s dead and gone. This line 💔. AWe were in a relationship. Things were going well but suddenly things turned around. He left me in pieces for another girl coz he thought that she understands him more than i did and she\u0027s more mature and they are getting a good vibe. I was in pieces and everyday each second she was in my head  like was she more cheerful and did she take care of him more than I. Well after years he felt guilty of his mistake and wanted to sort things between us. Coz he was still in love with me and he wanted to get things right. Well during this struggle i was broken and couldn\u0027t decide what to do but love was there and i went to him to give him some closure. during this, while making me understand and the thought that maybe I\u0027ll never get back to him- he died right in front of me coz he was so in guilt and i was not able to forgive him.this was so horrifying i cannot tell in words.the death of your lover in front of you and all you can do is nothing just uou can watch him and stare when people take his body away from you. This pain this guilt, this trauma, never goes away. Still I\u0027m so much in guilt and this guilt is consuming me. I can\u0027t tell how but this is killing me inside and I\u0027m sick. Each passing day is a struggle to exist coz each second he\u0027s in my mind and this guilt that he\u0027s no more because of me is so traumatic.  Please please please if someone is sorry and want to make things right, let them please coz we never know what\u0027s gonna happen next. Thanks for reading",

  "I lost my kitty today , she was a stray cat born with deformed hind legs and asthma , she was really tiny when she was born, everyone thought she wouldn\u0027t survive, her mother brought her to us , i took care of her , and in few months she looked so healthy and pretty, she would hop around the house like a little rabbit, everyone in home loved her .  Today she was 10 months old . As she became stronger we let her go outside for a while, she wouldn\u0027t go far from our home , just in the neighborhood and she came back everytime . But last night no one imagined it would be her last time coming home , i woke up  with the bad news that she is no more , i ran outside totally in disbelief, sobbing to see her little body without soul , you\u0027ll be forever remembered jenny ❤️‍🩹",

When we brought her home she died a few days later but her wish was granted. I have major exams coming up too and it’s so hard to keep going because those past few months were so stressful. I lost myself to grief over the past few months but my best friend refused to let me drown. Just a reminder to get out of bed every morning even when you don’t want to because there are people who want to see you everyday. ❤️‍🩹",

  "The song In the Stars by Benson Boone beautifully captures the pain of losing someone dear. The heartfelt lyrics and emotional melody resonate deeply, making it a perfect tribute to a loved one. Listening to it reminds me of my grandmother and how much I miss her every day. The song\u0027s message about love that never fades, even beyond this world, brings both comfort and tears",

  "Jesse was an eight-week-old Jack Russell Terrier when my wife Nicole first saw her in 1999. By all accounts there was an instant bond from their first meeting. Jesse Puppy Puppy Jesse, 1999. So from the time I came into the picture a few years later, Jesse (she was named for the “root’nest, toot’nest cowgirl” from the Toy Story movies) and I were both playmates and nemeses. I can say for a fact I have never seen an animal more devoted than this little dog was to Nic. She followed her into every room, and whenever she settled down it was always within close proximity. When Nic and I wrassled, or I launched a tickle assault, Jesse would nip at my arms or legs. Like, breaking skin at times. If I tried to “make a move” – even after years of marriage – I would have to contend with my wife’s dauntless protector. She slept in our bed at night (usually right between us), and when Nic left the house Jesse would go look after her thru the window. She ran with her, hiked with her, even rode on the paddleboard when Nic took it out on the water. Jesse \u0026amp; Zach Jesse with brother Zach, when both were much younger. When Nic was sick or blue, Jesse instinctively knew to snuggle close and provide comfort only a dog can offer (sorry cat-lovers.) Sometimes, a lot of times, Jesse sensed something was amiss before I did. When our daughter Layla was born a little more than nine years ago, Jesse became her protector as well. And when Layla was old enough, they all squeezed onto that paddleboard on the water together. Layla \u0026amp; Jesse Our late, great dog Jesse, with her kid sister Layla. Even among Jack Russells, Jesse was a high-energy pooch. She dashed madly all over the yard, loved to swim laps in the pool. In her younger days, we would see Jesse’s little head pop up and back again thru the window when we returned home, springy legs bouncing her like one of those old rubber super balls.  She was an amazing watch dog. If anyone contemplated setting foot on our property she would start barking to alert us of the intruder – and then continue for several minutes even as the visitor stood talking with us inside the house. Like many small dogs, she considered herself a Saint Bernard in stature and so feared no man nor beast. She just loved life. Over time, of course, the bouncing slowed. The hearing went, the vision blurred. A stranger could stand in the middle of the room and she wouldn’t notice for several minutes. Nic and I discussed what steps we should take, hoping Jesse would relieve us of a tough decision by going on her own terms, but her will to live was too strong. Just when we thought she was winding down, she’d suddenly explode with puppyish vigor again and we’d say, “Guess there’s some life in the old girl yet.” Jesse \u0026amp; Annabelle Jesse with baby niece Annabelle, Zach’s daughter. But in the last couple of weeks she had a hard time just balancing to stand. She lost her appetite and we found her staring blankly at walls or objects just an inch or two from her nose. She mainly just lied on the couch, often with Layla cuddling next to her. Once we finalized the decision, her hind legs pretty much stopped working overnight. The end came last Tuesday. It was, fittingly, gorgeous and brilliant blue outside. We took the day off, brought Jesse to Ogunquit Beach one last time, wrapped in a blanket, then brought her home and sat with her in the back yard. Our vet Kat Brandt, who makes house calls, was on hand along with Michele Lowry, an animal shaman lady, and they both helped ease the transition. Nic held Jesse in her lap. They had been together 17-and-a-half years. We all said our good-byes, Michelle assured us Jesse was ready to go, and the vet put her to sleep. It was an afternoon of sunshine and tears. I suppose there are more important things I could write about this week – terrorism, bombs, the stock market, rogue airlines, health care, a commander-in-chief who seems to realize only now that reality is not a TV show – but at the end of the day, what’s more important than family? I think some of us take for granted – until it’s no longer there – the reassurance we get from the constant presence of our animal family members. They are always there for us, always reliable. From the day we brought Layla home, Jesse was part of her life. Our son Zach now has a daughter of his own, but Jesse was part of his life for 17-and-a-half of his 21 years. We walk thru the door now and the house is empty. It’s hardest for Nic, who knew Jesse the longest and is always the first one home in the evening. I never could have imagined such a tiny dog leaving such a huge void. Even when she was too old to do the dance of joy she performed in her younger days, we came home knowing she was lying on the couch awaiting us. Nic \u0026amp; Jesse Jesse and my wife Nicole near the water, which they both loved. This is why too many dog movies have sad endings – it’s not unusual now to have people live into their 80s and 90s, but a pet who makes it to 15 is said to have had a good run. Jesse would have been 18 years old this August. We know we were lucky to have her so long, but in the end it just feels like another sad dog movie",

  "I lost my grandfather in November 2021. He died at a nursing home where he had lived for a few years with my grandmother before he passed. After he passed away, my grandmother had to move to a different room in the nursing home. We visit her every once in a while, and to be honest, I kind of forgot about my grandfather until about two weeks ago When we visited my grandmother, I had to use the bathroom, which is on the same floor where my grandparents used to live before my grandfather passed away. On the way to the bathroom, I saw the place where they had lived, and in that moment, all my memories with him came flooding back. I broke down into tears, ran to the bathroom, and stayed there for about 15 minutes, crying my heart out. Ever since that experience, I’ve been going through a rough time. It feels like reality, which I had been denying for three years, finally hit me. Since then I have been listening to the Song ever day",

  "@UniqueLifetims  Dear God, I lift up this person who has faced so much loss and carries so much pain. You know their heart, their struggles, and the weight they bear. Please wrap them in Your comforting embrace and remind them that they are not alone. Give them strength to keep moving forward, even when the path feels heavy. Fill their heart with hope, their spirit with peace, and their mind with moments of clarity and rest. Surround them with love, support, and light in the midst of their darkness. May they feel Your presence with every step they take. Amen.",

She checked on me and realized I was mumbling in my sleep, so she used my Libre to check my glucose. It showed I was dangerously low, around 1.0 - 2.0 mmol/L. She woke me up, but I started having a seizure, and my heart rate was racing. I couldn’t even hold the Lucozade bottle properly, and it spilled all over the bed. Eventually, I managed to drink some. My sister called an ambulance, and they got to me quickly, rushing me to the hospital. That day, I realized how valuable life is.",

To all my loved ones. I love you all. I wish you all have a great times in a better place a better life and have a wonderfull time in your resting. I wish I could I help. But I prevent anything, I’m going through a hard. I lost all my friends and have 1 left. Rumours spread around school, I’m now homeschooled. Struggling. Crying every night and almost every day. I’m not clean anymore in SH. I wish I could stop but I can’t, a guy from school tried to follow me home but failed, I’m scared to go outside. I’ve stayed inside fir 1 year. It hurts so now we have to travel to different places to not be around outside home. I’m scared of my naighbours. They do drugs and weed, argue and hurt each other Badly. Almost my whole road is filled with druggies. People who think their gangster. More kidnappings around more dangers. I’m scared. Teachers telling me they will throw me out the window and kill me when I was in year 4. I’m now much older and away from the teacher but still scared. I wish everyone who passed was still here. I wish nothing happened and sometimes I wish my mother’s birth pill worked. But times I’m happy it didn’t. It’s complicated. I’m confused. I don’t know who I am. I don’t know where I need to go. I don’t know what I need to do. I’m scared. I’m so sorry for dumping everything. I’m deleting this all in 2 days. ❤",

  "I had this best friend named Shauna she was my favorite person.On day she felt really sick and was took to the hospital 🏥.😢The next day we found out she had cancer.I never thought she will get cancer.She spent her remaining days with me and her family.She only had 5 day left to live.We made her wish came true before she died which was good to Disney land.We all had a blast 💥 till I remembered that she had cancer and I had to sit down and had to breath for a second I was having a mini panic attack till Shauna my friend came down beside me and calmed me down and I broke down into tears crying she hugged me.She said “I’ll always be looking down at you no matter what so don’t cry”.This song reminds me of her.  Thank you for reading this and if you liked have a good day 👆🏻true story of my life if you want a story of my cousins life keep on scrolling down Grace and Hanna had a beautiful family they would always go on vacation together.One day the dads friend came over and he started to talk about money.The mom started to cry because they were already struggling with money an then the mom ran upstairs and brought down a bag of money and asked the dad where did this come from the dad said it was his savings from when he was younger.Then all the sudden they started to fight Hanna and Grace were scared and in there room trying to be as calm as possible.All the sudden the mom ran out of her chair and said I can’t take this anymore and she went outside and drove to her friends house to cool down.Hanna and Grace went downstairs and the dad told them if their mom doesn’t come back they will get divorced and some how if you get her back they will talk about.        That’s all I know of their true story about their life so see yah!😊",

They said because our classmate died which is my friend, I still didn’t believe I waited him until he go to school but then he didn’t come until the our teacher told us the same thing and then our teacher said that my friend died because he can’t breath that good and has no oxygen.  Show all your love to your friends/family from now because some day the happy moments will be gone Sorry for bad English",

  "my grandma died at only 64 years old. i was 9. she had a rare colon cancer that was pretty much impossible to remove. in 2021, she was in the hospital during covid. they said she needed imeadiate surgery but waited till the morning. her kidney ruptured. and the cancer had spread. she was in the hospital for a week, got chemo therapy, then was reported cancer free. fast forward 2 years, she went to doc for a check-up, and they found cancer once again. this time much worse. it was a slime, and in order to remove it, they would have to do a very risky surgery, one wrong move and shes gone. she didnt want to do the surgery.  but still, why did she get the cancer again??  well, 2 years ago, they gave her the wrong chemo. so that weakened her immune system, and made the cancer stronger. she was such a strong woman. she helped us build a buissness when she was sick. then a few months later, she had blockages constantly. she could eat nothing. not ice, not water, nothing. she was a twig, and she had 6 tumors on her left side. i will never forget the image of my mema like that.  the hospice nurse gave her a medication that would put her to sleep until she passes. so my family said our last goodbyes. \u0027\u0027you shine so bright, dont ever dim, you are so special, i love you.\u0027\u0027 were the last words she said to me. after, she was asleep. later that night, at abt 11:29 pm, she had died.  my mom called me and told me. i was 9, she was 64. it was hardest thing i ever experienced. she died a few weeks before christmas, and my dad was broken. that was my dads mom. but, she had gotten us a gift before she passed.  she got us a blanket, with pictures of me and her on there. and it said \u0027\u0027Charlotte, you shine in your own special way. Love, Mema.\u0027\u0027 she got one for each of us, all with different things. tell me thats not special. she new she was going to die, just think about that.  she left her money to our family, but it would take a while for it to come thru to our account. on my birthday, it came through. and we were struggling financaly in that time period.  thats when my family realized she never left. she will always be with us. forever. she didnt want a funeral. she wanted a celebration of her life. she picked that happiest songs to sing, and every thing.  the words of my 6 yr old cousin hurt though. \u0027\u0027that was my grandma, will i see her again?\u0027\u0027 she asked me. i couldnt answer. to much greif. yet happiness. September 17, 1959- December 5, 2023. RIP mema. 🕊🌸",

  "This is a message sent out to all of those who have lost one or more loved ones. I know it may feel as though God has abandoned you, like you have no one else left to depend on, but I promise that God still loves you. REMEMBER death is not an action of God, but of the devil and although your loved one is not here on earth they are safe in God\u0027s arms now. Hopefully soon God will come back for us all and take us back with him and all of our loved ones. I pray that anyone who feels this way will be lifted up by this message and will carry their faith higher than ever before.",

  "On April 23 2024, was the day my auntie died from cancer. She fought a good 5 years, she wanted to see her youngest child graduate, but she knew she wouldn\u0027t be able to make it. She took care of me ever since I was little when my mother and father was busy at work, she helped me with studies, she was like a 2nd mother. Then we moved to America with my mother, father, and sister, we didn\u0027t get to see her again in The Philippines for 8 years. It pains me knowing we only got to see her again when she\u0027s gone. I wasn\u0027t expecting our reunion to be like that, I was expecting to see her in person, but God had other plans, and gave her rests after the war she battled with cancer. She loved singing, she cared about her kids, academics was her priority, she was strong mentally, she inspired and helped many people when she was still alive. So the only thing that keeps me smiling is the memories of her. Someone said, \"Maybe the word forever were only meant for memories, not people.\" And I live up to that till this day. It was hard for my mother, who was the eldest sister of my aunt,  it was hard for her to say goodbye to someone she lived with ever since they were kids and until they grew. Grieving takes time, so if you also lost someone, be patient with yourself, its okay to cry, its a part of grieving. All I can do is just pray she\u0027s in a better place, up with God. Till we see again, Auntie Rosalyn  ❤❤🙏",

Then for some reason i got hacked and to be honest i was not that sad I got a new account on Roblox and then a few months later i got my account back thanks to my big sister. I was crying happy tears cuz I was very happy to get it back then my parents started arguing and arguing none stop and then i was just pray and pray for this to be over it feels like everything i love is leaving me like being stranded at sea with no1. P.S Just want to share this with u all and also really hurt for a million different reasons and i feel like i just want to vanish from the Earth and never return again.

  "I lost my hamster not long ago it still hurts to even say her name or even here what her name was. She was my first ever pet i had to myself and when i lost her i felt like i lost a big part of me i know i will see her again someday but till then she will live on in my heart and my storys about her. I also lost my uncle and one of his dogs far apart from eachother but it felt so close together i am lost without the both of them feels like my life is ending around me everytime someone i love passes on. My aunt made a tree for me uncle last year and each of the family members got something that reminds them of him. When i went up i couldn\u0027t even get a few words out before i broke down i was really young when he injured his back and dont really remember what his smile used to look like. He helped so many people with paying for a vet bill that they couldn\u0027t pay. He helped us with when our dog was really sick he was like an angel to everyone he met and i will never forget him. This song hits really hard for me and when it say \"now your in the stars and 6 feets never felt so far\" i never knew how far it was till people and pets i loved the most passed.  I pray for everyone that is going through a loss thats having a really rough time. But it gets better dont hide your greaf let it out get a good cry in once in a while because if you hide it you wont get better even if its just by yourself greaf is out bodys way of saying to us its going to be ok never hide your greaf.",

  "Hey, you, yes, I am talking right to you. I hope you will see yourself with the eyes I see you one day, because I can tell you have some awesome music taste :) You’re such a beautiful human being and worth and enough. I hope you know that you do only need yourself to be happy, I know society build up the standard that whenever you’re alone you’re not living a happy live. But in fact that is not true, if you start to realize that you actually deserve all the good things happening to you, you will treat yourself a lot  nicer. I hope you let yourself rest, don’t beat yourself up over past mistakes, over regret, and over everything your mind wants to destroy you. I wish I could remove all those demons inside of your head because you deserve to feel happy. If you ever feel lonely then watch the sky, because you know, someone, at the same time is watching the sky too, maybe feeling the same way..I am glad you exist and I hope you won’t ever remove your own spot in this world, maybe you don’t feel like you belong here but, Angel, then build your home here. I don’t want you to leave this world unhappy. I want you to live every little second, I want you to feel alive, I don’t want you to see yourself just existing. You deserve it. Whatever happened, it’s not your fault, the demons in your head recognize that you have a beautiful heart, they want to take it because they have never seen such beautiful heart as yours, so why let them win over you? . You’re not selfish for isolating yourself, but you deserve to talk to someone. If you’re reading this than please never forget to breath and smile.  Don’t live up to other standards! It’s your story and not theirs.  Life for those who couldn’t, smile for those who forgot what a genuine smile is, love like there’s no other, hug like its your last one.  I love you and send you hugs. You’re so strong, you’re still here, and I am proud of you.  YOU ARE NOT USELESS. READ THAT AGAIN.  YOU ARE WORTH IT. READ THAT AGAIN. YOU ARE LOVED. READ THAT AGAIN. I AM GLAD YOU EXIST. READ THAT AGAIN. YOU ARE NOT A PROBLEM. YOU ARE HUMAN AND YOUR FEELINGS ARE VALID. READ THAT AGAIN. YOU ARE NOT BEING DRAMATIC.  You’re not a burden to anyone, don’t be afraid to talk, to use your voice.  You’re beautiful inside out. Your body is beautiful the way it is.  Please don’t starve yourself. Please eat, I know it’s hard but you deserve food. You deserve to eat and drink.  I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. READ THAT AGAIN. I WISH I COULD HUG YOU RIGHT NOW, SO A VIRTUAL HUG WILL DO!! \u003c3  It hurts me to see you’re in pain :( you deserve so much man, don’t let your emotions control you. Don’t let them get the best of you.  I love u I love u I love u I love u I love u please don’t go.. I am sorry that no one is hearing you, I am sorry no one is noticing that you have lost yourself. I wish I could take your pain away, it hurts me to see the pain in your eyes.  I love you trough my words and I mean it. I just want you to stay, hold on a little longer okay? Please? For me.?? I hope you have an awesome day/ morning/ evening/ night.  If it’s night for you, go to sleep, I know it’s hard to fall asleep right now but you deserve a good sleep. If you have nightmares, please, don’t let them fight you.  If it’s day for you, don’t start it by such sad music, I know it’s impossible to have a good day with such mindset but take baby steps, start by drinking two cups of water in the morning and so on.. You will start building little healthy habits.  If it’s evening for you, you’re probably overwhelmed and stressed, I want you to know it’s okay to feel the way you feel. You don’t need to be scared, of course you’re overwhelmed or stressed, I mean who wouldn’t? But it’s important to know that when you feel that way you should do a little self care, such as taking a bath for example? You deserve to feel at ease and relaxed. And if you are somewhere in between I hope you know that you’re stronger than you think, I know you will make it :)  All I want for you is to stay and feel alive.  Now wipe those tears away and smile for me, you really don’t know much a smile can brighten someone’s day, do you? I hope one day yours will become a genuine one where you don’t need to fake it anymore, because I can’t say this enough, you deserve a good smile and to feel alive. You’re worth more than every fucking cent in this world. I need you here with me :).  Remember crying is not weakness, let it out as much as you can but don’t let the emotion control you by giving up. It’s okay, you’re here, you’re safe, you can let it out. Did anyone asked you, how you are feeling today? If not, how are you really? I don’t think you’re doing good, but you will feel good at one point. Don’t give yourself up.  I am sorry you feel misunderstood. But anyone who gets to be with you, doesn’t know how fucking lucky he/ she/ they is :). Enough with beating up yourself for today, okay?! I hope this is enough for you to stay today, tomorrow will be a new day, a new start, let go now. I hope you can stay. This is your sign to stay and treat yourself with love, you deserve it. And in case no one told you today, again, I am so proud of you.  I hope you will remember my words Until tomorrow, my friend :).",

Even if you don\u0027t believe in Him, He loves you dearly and He doesn\u0027t need you to believe in Him immediately, but He\u0027ll always have your back. That\u0027s what He taught me.",

  "Воскресное утро было твоим любимым. Я встречал тебя на Вудс-Крик-роуд, У тебя была укладка, как у знаменитости, Даже если мы с тобой шли только в церковь. Теперь, по утрам воскресенья, я просто сплю, Будто похоронил свою веру вместе с тобой. Я кричу на Бога, не знаю, верю ли я, Ведь я не знаю, что ещё можно сделать. Я всё ещё держусь за навсегда ушедшее. Не хочу говорить «прощай»: ведь это означает «навеки». Теперь ты среди звёзд, а шесть футов никогда не ощущались такой далью. И здесь я один, между небом и догорающими воспоминаниями. О, как же больно По сотне разных причин. Ты забрала лучшее из моего сердца, И остальное разбила вдребезги. Перебираю твои старые открытки на день рождения. Смятая двадцатка всё ещё в коробке. Не знаю, смогу ли я вообще её потратить, Даже если это будет моя последняя двадцатка. Я всё ещё держусь за навсегда ушедшее. Не хочу говорить «прощай»: ведь это означает «навеки». Теперь ты среди звёзд, а шесть футов никогда не ощущались такой далью. И здесь я один, между небом и догорающими воспоминаниями. О, как же больно По сотне разных причин. Ты забрала лучшее из моего сердца, А остальное разбила вдребезги. Я всё ещё держусь, о, Держусь, держусь. Всё ещё держусь, Я всё ещё Держусь. Я всё ещё держусь за навсегда ушедшее. Не хочу говорить «прощай»: ведь это означает «навеки». Теперь ты среди звёзд, а шесть футов никогда не ощущались такой далью. И здесь я один, между небом и догорающими воспоминаниями. О, как же больно По сотне разных причин.

Today it\u0027s been 2 months since you left and I still haven\u0027t been able to accept it, but I\u0027ll hold on to the fullest. rest in peace Moonbin❤❤",

  "12 years ago , I kissed my husband and let him leave in another city , at 6:55 he called me to say he is on his way back , at 7:00 I\u0027ve got a call from his phone telling me that my husband is dead. I met him for the first time at church,  he was tall , having black hair and made in 2 parts, he was looking really handsome so I couldn\u0027t take my eyes from him 😊😊 , our eyes meet so I got embarrassed and watched on the window 😅😅, I was surprised to see that I can see his the reflection of his face on the window 🤭🤭🤭 so I watched on the window for the last 2 hours ❤❤❤. Then I waited every Sunday to meet him again . Once I took my courage and grabbed his hand seeing I\u0027m glad he came back 🤧🤧. Then he asked my name but didn\u0027t tell me his name so the next 3 months I used all my connections to find out his name😅😅😅. In the end I found his name , was Iuli , ah, I never heard this name till him. I was going once at the market and meet him , he called me on my sister name and I got extremely angry and sent them to her 😂😂😂😂😂😂. He said he asked around and people told him that my name is Rebecca 😅😅😅😅😅. So I forgave him and told him my name 😂😂😂. He was so cute when he said ,I was fooled. I asked the name of the most beautiful girl in your family  and they said Rebecca.  😂😂😂😂😂😂. The thing is that I didn\u0027t use to get out so people didn\u0027t know of my existence 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.  Ah, then we started to date ,than I ran with him because my family was against him . We were married for 8 years , then he died. He promised he would never let me by myself but I remained all by myself,  I lost my job ,I lost my house ,and I lost my dreams. I entered coma for 3 months and when I wake up I tried to suicide few times. I was having 2 kids that time so one day I wake up and decide to live for my kids. I sometimes  still watch the sky when I came back from work in the night and look for the star he was giving me one night when we were fighting and I was crying rivers. Even my kids are saying when they see the star \" Look mom ,that\u0027s you star \" . I once thought that I can\u0027t hear my heart beat, last time I heard it was many years ago . But I\u0027m still here...",

Mar Dinkha IV (Classical Syriac: ܡܪܝ ܕܢܚܐ ܪܒܝܥܝܐ and Arabic: مار دنخا الرابع), born Dinkha Khanania (15 September 1935 – 26 March 2015)[1] was an Eastern Christian prelate who served as the 120th Catholicos-Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East. He was born in the village of Darbandokeh (Derbendoki), Iraq, and led the Church in exile in Chicago for most of his life. Personal life Dinkha Khanania was born in Iraq and baptized in the Church of Mar Qaryaqos located in the village of his birth, Darbandokeh. Khanania (also written as \"Denkha Kh\u0027nanya\") gained his elementary education under the tutorship of his grandfather, Benyamin Soro. In 1947—at the age of eleven—he was entrusted to the care of Mar Yousip Khnanisho, Metropolitan and the Patriarchal representative for all Iraq, the second-highest-ranking ecclesiastic of the Assyrian Church of the East.[2] After two years of study, he was ordained deacon in the church of Mar Youkhana in Harir by Mar Yousip on 12 September 1949. On 15 July 1957, he was ordained to the priesthood, and appointed to minister Urmia, Iran. He was the fourth in the line of succession to the Bishopric of Urmia. Mar Dinkha\u0027s priesthood as Metropolitan of Iran and Tehran[2] reestablished a line of succession which had ceased to exist after the 1915 assassination of his predecessor.[3] In 1962, Mar Dinkha moved from northern Iraq to Tehran  Mar Gewargis in Tehran. Mar Dinkha died on 26 March 2015 in Rochester, Minnesota.[1][4] Tenure as Catholicos-Patriarch After the assassination of Mar Shimun XXI Eshai, the Church of the East had an urgent need to restore its leadership. In 1976, the prelates of the church convened in London to elect a new Catholicos Patriarch and chose Mar Dinkha as the most qualified candidate to fill the post.[2] He was consecrated on 17 October 1976, in the West London Church of St. Barnabas, Ealing.[5] With this consecration, Mar Dinkha IV became the successor to the Apostolic see of Seleucia-Ctesiphon (Babylon). He also announced that the hereditary line of succession for the Patriarchy which had existed for 500 years[6] was discontinued with his tenure, allowing any cleric from the Church of the East to be elevated to Catholicos-Patriarch.[7] I wish I could meet him again, membership in the Church of the East rose from 3,200 in the 1950s[3] to approximately 100,000 in 2008.[9] In 2005, the Patriarch conducted discussions with President of Iraqi Kurdistan Masoud Barzani on returning to the Apostolic See in northern Iraq and constructing a new residence in Ankawa.[10] On 15 July 2007, Mar Dinkha celebrated 50 years of his priesthood. A ceremony was held at St. George Cathedral in Chicago, where a portion of Ashland Avenue was renamed \"His Holiness Mar Dinkha IV Blvd\". In 2008, he received an honorary degree from the University of Chicago,[11] in part because of his emphasis on education—he stated a goal of only appointing theologians with doctoral degrees to the position of bishop.[12] Travels and ecumenism Dinkha made ecumenism a priority during his reign,[13] as well as advocacy for the Assyrian people.[14] Relations with the Catholic Church Dinkha promoted closer relations with the Catholic Church, both with the Vatican and the Chaldean Catholic Church; he first met Pope John Paul II immediately after the Pope\u0027s election in 1978[15] and made his first visit to the Vatican in 1984.[16] The two continued to meet informally over the next decade.[17] After a decision by the Holy Synod of the Assyrian Church of the East to have better relations with the Roman Catholic Church in 1994,[18] Dinkha agreed to a Joint Christological Declaration with the Holy See.[19] The \"Common Christological Declaration Between the Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East\" declares that it is \"[a] basic step on the way towards the full communion to be restored between their Churches;\" emphasized common doctrinal positions between the two bodies, such as the Nicene Creed; and clarifies that the centuries the two have spent out of communion were due to geographic and cultural issues rather than doctrinal differences.[20] On 29 November 1996, Dinkha signed an agreement of cooperation with the Patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldean Catholic Church—Raphael I Bidawid—in Southfield, Michigan[17] and met again on 16 August 1997, to bless an Assyrian church.[12] This \"Joint Synodal Decree for Promoting Unity\" also established a Joint Commission for Unity which helped draft the 2001 \"Guidelines for Admission to the Eucharist between the Chaldean Church and the Assyrian Church of the East\" that allows Assyrians and Chaldeans to accept the Eucharist from one another.[21] The prior year, Assyrians and Roman Catholics also produced \"A Common Statement on Sacramental Life\" that assessed the importance of sacraments in both churches.[22] Assyrians have also been allowed to study at Baghdad\u0027s Chaldean Catholic College and unmarried deacons and priests can study at Catholic universities in Rome.[12] Middle Eastern and Syriac ecumenism The Church of the East has been a member of the World Council of Churches since its 1948 inception and Dinkha used this membership as a vehicle for bi- and multi-lateral ecumenism that would have been impossible prior to its inception.[23] In 1984, the Assyrian Church applied for membership in the Middle East Council of Churches (MECC), but was denied due to objections by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, whose Patriarch, Pope Shenouda III, required the Church of the East to condemn its Church Fathers Diodore of Tarsus, Nestorius, and Theodore of Mopsuestia.[23] The dispute between the Assyrians and Copts resulted in a common Christological declaration in 1996, which was later rejected by the Coptic synod.[24] In 1996, the Church of the East was offered membership in the MECC, but declined to join at the time.[25] Discussions for the Church of the East to join the MECC have stalled since 1999. The Austrian Pro Oriente Foundation brought together several Syriac churches in Vienna in 1994 to start a common dialogue amongst the Ancient Church of the East, the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Indian (Malankara) Orthodox Church, Maronite Church, Syriac Catholic Church, Syriac Orthodox Church, Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, and Syro-Malankara Catholic Church. Representatives of these churches along with academics founded the Commission on Dialogue Within the Syriac Tradition.[26] Consultations have been convened intermittently since that time. As a product of this process, Dinkha entered into negotiations with the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch Mar Ignatius Zakka I Iwas in 1997 and the two churches ceased anathematizing each other.[27] Although Dinkha spent over 20 years in dialogue with the Ancient Church of the East, the two remain out of communion.[16] In 1995, the Indian metropolitan see pledged its allegiance to Dinkha,[7] leaving the Ancient Church primarily active in the Middle East, with some 50,000–70,000 members.[12] In 1999, Dinkha declared that all ordinations and orders from the Ancient Church were valid.[28] Political work and Assyrian advocacy In September 2006, Mar Dinkha IV paid a historic visit to northern Iraq to give oversight to the churches there and to encourage the president of Iraqi Kurdistan to open a Christian school in Erbil. During this trip, he also met Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Dinkha pursued a pragmatic political course, calling on Assyrians to work together with their respective governments. He sought to de-politicize the office of Catholicos-Patriarch and expanded the church\u0027s outreach to the youth by including non-Syriac liturgies composed in local languages.[29]",

  "Some days are better, some days are worse, look for the blessing instead of the curse. Be positive, stay strong, and get enough rest. You can\u0027t do it all, but you can do your best.     Life has a funny way of teaching us you know.  It will give us sad times so we can love the happy times. It will make our lives chaotic, so we can truly enjoy the peaceful times. And it will take those who we love away from us so we can truly understand what their presents meant to us. What I\u0027m saying is live life to the fullest. We can\u0027t live forever, but we can sure well try.",

We have been studying in the same school for that long and knowing when We graduate and continue studying in separate schools may not seem at all a negative thing. I know it\u0027s not something bad at all. It\u0027s just that I\u0027m scared that We\u0027ll grow apart. He has been My emotional supporter, a friend in need. And now, near graduating I developed a slight bit of love for Him, and He\u0027s also caring for Me when I need help or when I\u0027m down. Seeing Him having new friends in a new city, I feel proud but yet so anxious of His personality shift if He goes a bit too far. Since the beginning of this year, I have been hoping that one day He\u0027ll come up and say \"Let\u0027s stay connected. I love You with all My heart. Don\u0027t go without Me.\" And I hope when He does say that, this song will give Me courage and hope to spend more time with Him within the last few months with Him.",

  "To all the Arohas that came here after Moonbin’s passing, I would just like to say a few things. I know the news was really sudden and many of you are distraught by this, it is ok to be sad, to cry and to grieve. Afterall, Moonbin was our comfort zone and our role model.  If letting your emotions out make you feel better, have a good cry. However, let’s not be sad for too long, Moonbin has finally found peace and is no longer in pain, mentally and physically and he is resting well up there. I am sure he will be watching over the rest of the members and each and every Aroha. Let’s continue showing our unconditional support and love for the other members. From now on, whenever we look up into the night sky and see the moon, let’s treat it as Moonbin is telling us that he is doing well up there and there is no need to worry anymore. He is and will forever be our Moon that shines brightly in the night. Lastly, this is for everyone, if you ever feel too tired to go on, take a break from whatever is stressing you out. Go and do what you love, talk to someone about your struggles. If you have no one to talk to, you can always reply to this comment and I will be your listening ear. Struggles are not forever, it too will pass.",

You don’t have to look too far into the past or the future, it’s more than enough to just live in the moment and simply focus on the now, so don’t wait until it’s too late to reach out to others! I’m sure just as much as you would like to talk to others and tell them of your appreciation, there’s lots that they would like to say and share with you too! I know it’s hard to find happiness and fulfilment in everything that you do, but I hope you find a way to appreciate every moment of this beautiful life, and just know that there is always hope for things to get better. And, there are lots of people out there full of love and support, ready to catch you if you fall. Please take good care and treat yourself with patience and with kindness~ Stay strong darling, stay strong~ 💪 ❤",

Her parents and grandparents also died in the shooting, and her younger brother was left with permanent brain damage, and no family. He now lives with me and my family in Canada.

My friend and I were diagnosed with Leukaemia within 6 months of each other. Two months after my friend passed away, I lose another one of my best friends in a plane crash, along with her entire family.  I\u0027m not over their deaths, and if I\u0027m being honest, I don\u0027t think I ever will be. My heart goes out to anyone who has ever lost someone whom they love.",

She passed away in August. And me and my mom and sister were outside of the country for the hole year because of we got stuck for corona . But what hurts me more is that my birthday was in 26th may and she said happy birthday to me but I didn\u0027t know that was the last time she would say it to me . Everytime during my exams I use to say her to pray for me . She used to be so lonely . And she use to live alone . And I miss her a lot . I just don\u0027t cry infront of people but I miss her alot and I wish I could say goodbye . But last goodbyes hurt the most .  To everyone who lost their loved ones I hope you are okey . It hurts and ik that . Pife is hard so take care of yourself. Be happy that they were if our life .  We all have that one person who is our favorite hello and painful and hardest goodbye .  Cry as much as you want cause crying is a sign that you were strong .  Take care .",

When I heard that I was staring at a spot 20 minutes and then broke down to tears i slamed the door and cried for hours. I stopped believing in god  i was mad at god so much.

He would dress up nicely to meet me and my mother( my father left when I was 3 months old). We would decide on which place we would go to eat breakfast. My uncle loved me so much. He believed in God, and so did I. I would pray with him every Sunday night. Ever since he left, my grandfather became aggressive and would often hit me. MY grandfather blamed me for my Uncle\u0027s death. This song made me tear up. But, I had to stay strong. I\u0027m still young, and I\u0027m sure my uncle would be sad if I committed suicide before reaching university. So,just a little reminder to all who lost their loved ones; they are watching you from the heavens above.😌😌🙏🙏Continue to believe in God, and eventually, you will find hapiness.",

And so I lost my faith among with a big part of myself. So, the entire song reminds me my whole life, how I used to believe, my greif and pain, the fact that I sleep in on Sundays, how I burried a peice of me and my soul with him, me yelling at a God that I didn\u0027t know for sure if I believe in anymore to how much it marked my life and shuttered my heart",

The one thing I will say is that you are seeing the results of this sin cursed world. What our free will has done. Christ will love you through your anger towards Him. Earth is our Hell right now. Just know that when we finish the race, we leave this Hell, and will be reunited. Until then, we will feel forsook, anger, and hopelessness. Even Jesus on the cross asked His Father “Why have you forsaken me?” He had to bear the results of sin for us. Just know that this Hell will end for us. You don’t need to live a religion or attend a church every Sunday, that’s bullshit. Christ hears our anger, He can handle it.",

You don’t need the phony bullshit of the fake christians living their religious lives of “happiness,” meanwhile you are seeing live results of this God forsaken world. You can give up hope. You can feel rage. If God made us, He can handle our feelings, right?! You don’t need to go to church, you don’t need organized religion. Always tell God how you really feel.

I used to blame god as well because I only prayed for her well-being I never asked anything for myself and she was taken from me but as the years passed I started to think how it isn’t gods fault, things just happen. What we can do is make the most of the time we share with others and hope to be here for a long time. You see all the ppl I just mentioned? They aren’t the only ones, I can’t even begin to count how many of the people I love are dead.

  "If it means there is one less confused person who felt what i felt when i lost my faith and came to grips with reality than welcome to waking up friend :) I think the negativity we feel when we struggle with the imaginary friend who could never change the results we don\u0027t want have nothing to do with hopelesness and everything to do with complacency  My dad once told me to pray the bed bugs away and that he could talk to einstien in heaven at will.... Its an easy thing to believe in but reality is harder Reality takes time. I like king crocoduck as a physics professor : D and his videos  are good on debunking christian mythology so is aron ra\u0027s work about ww2 pilots and how he never could admit chrashing. Sam harris waking up podcast n richard dawkins the god delusion. Its better to raise consciousness than turn a blind eye n choose delusion. I respect the negative emotion n feeling of muscle burn as well as a pursuit to change what you don\u0027t like. Even if you can\u0027t change it forever having the change you gave now is enough and the emotions you passed to him through your delusion doesn\u0027t take away their impact or positivity from his perspective :D I doubt he has lost hope at all I bet hes waking up to reality and thats ok",

  "I lost both my grandparents within a month (both my dad’s) I lost my grandfather at end of June 2022 and on the 1st August 2022 my grandmother left . I still can not believe it. They lived in a different country and I hardly ever got to see them. I can’t exactly remember seeing them as I only saw them when I was 2, I am 15 now. My dad used to visit them frequently, but I refused to fly just because of my phobia of planes.  I still can’t believe how much regret I have by not seeing them regularly. I would do anything to see them even just for a second and say to them how much I love them . And this is just a brilliant soothing song, to help me calm down and know that they are in a better place now  And a message to anyone else, please try and spend as much time as you possibly can with your loved ones because you never know, that their life can suddenly be taken away from them and you will never be able to speak to them and see them again and show your love. So please guys, you do not want to have the regret I have, please enjoy spending time with your loved ones because they will be so important in your life and you will not want to see them go❤❤",
  "Heavenly Father God I pray for everyone listening to this song that they would just know that they are loved, and whatever troubles and losses they are struggling and going through right now. That they would just know that you have a plan God and they are not useless and they are not something to be treated horribly by others or themselves and that they have been made by the almighty God for a reason. And they may have every right to cry out these tears, but I pray they would realize that you do everything for a reason and someday they will be noticed or blessed by your love. God I pray that whatever they are struggling with that they would just talk to a family member or friend or anyone, and even me if they aren’t comfortable. I pray that you would just help them through their hurt times and that you would keep them safe. In Jesus name I pray Amen🙏  Guys I just want you to know that I am here for you and if you ever need to talk you can always talk to me and I’m here to help. I I hope you know that you are loved soooo very much by the lord God our father! God Bless!❤️🙏",

She had entries about how she loved me in her diary and she had photos taken with me as a baby and everything. I\u0027m so sad she couldn\u0027t experience a full and happy life and she was in a wheelchair for a while. I remember when I was two I went to her remembrance at her school. I cried for hours and have a full journal with songs and chats when I was seven about how I loved her so much and I still do.  I was in London then and I remember when we went to the hospital one day and they told us she had passed. We planted tulips and I asked my mum if they would live forever. my first real raw lesson about life was that nothing lives forever. I moved twice internationally since then and I wish more than ever she was here now. I have started secondary and life is dreadful. I lost another older sibling as a baby from the same illness and one of my other brothers have now moved away. I had a test and had a conversation with her. It helped me. Thank you for reading this and I hope you have an amazing day. Goodbye Louisa 1999-2013 she died nine years ago at fourteen she would be starting her own family if she wanted, gone to uni, and had a good job but she had to be taken.  Goodbye and I love you.",

The issue though, is I tried so hard to be a friend to him. I accidentally made him feel threatened and he got mad, it’s unrealistic/unreasonable how mad he got.I had no way of knowing what I was doing would go south. I don’t understand why he hates me now. Now I’m afraid that everyone else who is grieving will hate me too. It’s a confusing word out there",

Sorridente, aquela garota que vivia correndo pelos cantos, fazendo os outros sorrir com suas brincadeiras, a amorosa, ela morreu. Eu cresci e agora... eu não me reconheço mais, só vivo chorando pelos cantos e me sinto tão, tão insuficiente!! Por favor, não duvidem de meus sentimentos, não duvidem das minhas palavras. Quando eu digo que \" eu te amo\" é porque eu realmente te amo e faria muita coisa por você, quando eu digo \" que quero sumir\" eu estou pedindo socorro, por favor, não deixe meus pensamentos tomarem conta de mim. Mamãe e papai, eu amo demais vocês e faria muita coisa pela felicidade dos dois, me perdoem pelas idiotices, pela infantilidade, pela irresponsabilidade, pelas ignorâncias, eu juro que eu dou o meu máximo, não é culpa minha... :(   Vovó e vovô, vocês sempre estarão em meu coração, obrigada por apresentarem Jesus para mim, eu amo vocês com todo o meu coração e me perdoem por ser uma neta horrível. Amigos... Eu amo a cada um de vocês... Sempre vou amar, obrigada por tudo que fizeram por mim até hoje, sempre estarão em meu coração, perdoem por todas as minhas falhas com vocês, por não ser uma amiga boa, pelas idiotices, pelas coisas sem sentidos, pelas brincadeiras, por magoar e decpecionar cada um de vocês, eu dou o meu máximo. Obrigada por estarem comigo, mesmo eu não merecendo. Maninho.. você é tão especial pra mim, nunca esqueça da sua irmãzinha chatinha, eu te amo muito meu amor, quero ver você crescer e ser tornar um homem de Deus, espero que ele me dê oportunidade pra isso, bjoo. Jesus, obrigada por não me abandonar sempre que eu precisei, me perdoa por tudo que eu fiz, por lhe decpecionar toda vez... DEUS, eu não sou digna de ser chamada tua filha... Mas tu tens um amor tão grande por mim, eu lhe agradeço senhor. É fml, tá difícil, mas vamos sair dessa😔",

  "About 9 months ago I lost my mother.... Your comment is 8 months old so it was around that time.... My last exam was on March 30th and my mother was hospitalized for some time... But her voice was getting better in calls and my father told me she\u0027s recovering so i decided to stay and watch a movie on March 31st with friends where I study ( it\u0027s common thing that we whole class go watch a movie after the last exam day ) it\u0027s 12 hour journey to my home and another 3 hours journey to the hospital that my mother was admitted... My sister was taking care of her and my father was balancing work and hospital at the same time... I returned on the morning of April 1st to home and my father asked me to leave to the hospital immediately... But l thought I would take a nap and since I travelled all 12 hours in the night in a bus I hadn\u0027t slept as well.. I called my mom and she sounded fine... I told her I have reached home safely and will come shortly to see you..... So i took a nap and that nap turned out I slept 8 hours while my father was at work....  So i left my home early morning at 7 on 2nd April and got to the hospital...  She was very good when I got there as well... I talked with her and reassured her... I also bought something for her in the afternoon... Bought some popcorn at night.... Idk wtf happened suddenly around 11.... She started screaming she couldn\u0027t handle the pain... No painkillers helped... So she was shifted to the ICU the next morning after suffering all night long...and on April 4th at around 10 pm... She left us....  The thing that frightens me the most is one day late and i wouldn\u0027t be able to spend memorable last day with her... I will cherish that last day memories What pains me is that I could have had 2 more such days with her but I missed out on my ignorance.... If only I had known...  At least I am glad that I was able to say goodbye... One day late and I would have had the same pain you have for the rest of my life....  Hope you get better.... You are alone...",
