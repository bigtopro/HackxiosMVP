{A child is born weak in every way. Above all, he needs the affection he receives from his parents or caregivers. They are his role models, and he learns many of their habits. Over time, these habits become instinctive and are stored in memory, but he may also acquire wrong habits, such as favoritism towards siblings or other wrong habits. Religion may also be a wrong habit. A child's mind is not yet fully developed, so how can he choose a religion and learn about God at an early age? For example, reproduction in nature and science is natural. It is very likely that a child will come and worship strange things. For example, if I change my religion, leave my family, travel to a faraway country, get married, and have a child, my child will come and worship my new religion. What a wrong principle in choosing a religion! This is the greatest evidence that God created us with the heart and mind to know God when we grow up. I have a suggestion for you: Food and drink contain happy hormones. Fast for ten full days. Abstain from food and drink until sunset.  Go to your temple and repeat, fast for another ten days, go to the mosque and pray with the congregation. Read in your own language, and that's fine. Where does peace and tranquility come from when you are in direct communion with God? Life is short. How long will you live? More than a hundred years, and then you will die. Only your work will benefit you. Everyone will abandon you. If you like it, follow my posts and share the post so that everyone can benefit.}

{I remember when this was 4 years old in 2021}
{I had seen this song several times, but I was lazy and all... This is quite a deep message, sometimes, we don't notice how our qualities can be appreciated, so we just hide ourselves, pretending to "be normal", but...  It's not fair to hide something that's yours for fear, share it, if they don't like it, okay, their loss, but if they like it... You might find some people that you can share with, and that's what matters the most... Not feeling alone}

What a true happy ending.}

After all, this track shows part of my life, I don’t have friends, a girl, etc., but I have so many emotions, a storm of songs Lots of imagination how to make a track or any composition. And if someone reads this I want to say never give up do the same thing you run and remember the most difficult beginning.}

But now, the times have changed, After my family got rid of poor life, Those DJ tracks went far away from me. After Mello dropped Bad Bunny, I just went to his channel and selected popular in the videos category and saw this video.....Stil,l I love you mellow...}

{🥰❤謝謝你❤感謝你愛心💯💯💯❤尊敬佩服❤鞠躬 財運         捨方能得，不捨不得，捨即佈施。1.財佈施得財富。         2.法佈施。凡是別人想知道、想學習的合于正道的方法，只要自己懂、自己會，就熱心去教，能夠得聰明智慧的果報。         3.無畏佈施。即在眾生身心不安、恐懼害怕時，能夠幫助其消除恐懼，如此會得健康長壽的果報。         曾有一個學員功德很大，自己捐助了許多貧困的孩子，家裡還養了八個孩子，親生的卻只有兩個。離婚後跟她婆婆說：「我什麼都沒給過妳，我給妳買處房子。」就將僅有的幾萬塊錢奉獻給了婆婆，之後她每年仍堅持過年過節及婆婆生日去孝敬婆婆，很令人感動。此外，她每年都要親自去貧困地區捐款，送一些衣物。她當初沒錢，從一個拾破爛的到今天有了自己的生意，並有兩處房子，這都是捨來的。         貪小便宜吃大虧的道理。這個易經太極圖，出去的是一個魚尾巴，回來的卻是一個大腦袋。要是貪小便宜，等到明年吃虧就比今年大。         什麼叫貪小便宜？比如把單位的信封、信紙等東西帶回家，單位分東西時先挑好的，為講價錢跟做小買賣的爭吵等等。古人曾訓誡：「于肩挑小販、苦力，莫討便宜。」         貪心過重的表現，讓人賺不到什麼錢，那他們怎麼活？社會怎麼發展？ 提示：你要求別人的時候，你要先付出，因果才能成立。         你怎麽樣對人，人亦會怎麼樣對你。人與人交往一定要守時，你不守時要求別人守時沒有道理。欠人東西一定要還的，欠人時間也一樣要還的。人家要你幫助時，你常說等一下，你自己去辦事就不要怪別人要你等一下了。         改造命運只能靠自己改。         逢人要說好話，這是別人對你說好話的因。每天對人施捨笑容，施捨好話，可以使身邊的人身心安樂，這也是行善！         有一個老人特別省，我到他家一看，全是破爛堆，他還說：「我勤儉節約」。我說：「你家倒楣事也多。」他說：「是，我也不知道怎麼回事。」「你貪心啊！有捨不得的心，財運就不行。」他問：「那我怎麼變財運？」「你把家裡的破爛捨一捨、賣一賣，支援國家建設。」他問：「靈嗎？」我說：「靈！」他把破爛賣完了，他兒子多年沒找到工作，結果找著了。 舉一個例子：        上了公共汽車，一元錢。剛好，只有一張十元，放了十元進投幣箱，感覺我的十元沒有白花，那你種了9元錢的種子。 提示：捨的時候不太樂意，得的時候也會困難，這是現實中眾多的人為什麼來錢那麼困難的原因。 「好讀書，不求甚解」。這是一句好話，現代人不明白這個也是讀書捷徑。選一些好書給還沒有上小學的小朋友讀，不要解釋，讓他們每天讀，慢慢他們就能夠背下來，背下來後還要每天早晚讀，慢慢心中就會平靜下來，產生定力；心有定力，知識才能轉化為智慧，為自己所用。         科學家曾做了一個試驗，把一支玻璃試管插入水的容器內，然後，收集人們在不同心態下的「氣水」，結果發現了：當一個人心平氣和時呼出的氣體變成水後，澄清透明，無色；悲痛之時水中有少許白色沉澱；生氣時則有紫色的沉澱。當他們把受試者生氣時呼出的「生氣水」，注射到一隻大白鼠身上，幾分鐘後大白鼠就死了。         免疫力可以通過身體鍛煉等多種途徑得以增強，但是，人心理的平靜度才是免疫力的本源。         發怒是「火燒功德林」，將你以前辛苦積累的福德化為灰燼。特別是針對自己的時候，千萬不能起嗔恨心。用別人的錯誤來懲罰自己，損失太大了！ 生氣恨心者命還是不好，悲傷完了並不生氣者，命運會很快好轉，事業開始轉運。 氣恨心重的人命多悲慘，隨和謙讓的人命特好，得天之道。若生氣恨心，以後就會發生一件生氣的事，若天天如此，堆積太多了，災害必降。         有的女孩問我怎麼變漂亮，我說：「天天微笑，三年以後必見成效。」        老人窮，我教他參：     1.「我不應該受不了好」。受不了好就是跟自然力較勁，給錢不要，自然力就不給你了，不給你又生氣又埋怨：「我怎麼這麼窮、這麼苦？」   2.多參自己說的過頭話，「爭取變成好東西，好東西沒錢。」 3.「有那麼多錢有什麼用？我夠吃夠喝就得了。」心口如一，自然力會保佑這樣的人，心口不一。自然力讓你夠吃喝，有事時沒錢。 4.「我不應該看不上別人。」 你看不上別人，別人就看不上你的店。 5.「我不應該跟人較勁」。 你較勁，客戶就跟你較勁。 6.人不能有私心，發財應該先祝願客戶都能得到滿意的結果，能給他們帶來優質的服務和美好的回憶。 書名：周老師講心法 好書：弟子規。         于道光先生說：某夜，有個書生路過東嶽廟，有個人竟然從緊閉的廟門中穿了出來，書生便撲向前去，跪倒在地，嘴巴還直嚷嚷著：神明顯靈啦！那人立刻伸手將他攙扶起來，並對他說道：「這位仁兄誤會了，我並不是你口中所謂的神明，我是右臺司鏡官，出差到此來遞送統計資料的。」 「莫非就是在管理那面辨別世間善惡的業力鏡嗎！」 「你剛才所提的業力鏡，顯現的人表現在外的善行與惡事。」 「諸天神明便決議，將原來業力鏡移到左臺，用來顯現人的作為；再於右臺增設這一面心鏡，讓人可以清楚地看到他們的內心。清澈潔淨如水晶的人，就是千中選一。而我的工作就是當人面對心鏡時，從旁記錄鏡中所顯現的一切，每三個月一次，將所記的資料送到東嶽大帝座前，作為降罪賜福的依據。至於這降罪賜福的標準，則是名氣越大，對其要求自然也就越高、越嚴；掩飾的伎倆越是精細，那麼處罰也就越重。」         書生聽完後，便再三向神官拜謝。 作者 紀曉嵐        德澤蔭後         宛平縣有個陳鶴齡。他弟媳要求分家另居。弟媳說：「大哥你是一個男子漢，能多方經營。我只是一個寡婦女流，子女又小，請你把家產分給我三分之二。」         陳鶴年說：「弟媳說的是，應當依從她。」         弟媳又以孤寡不能出去追索欠債為藉口，要求再把現有財貨分成兩份，而把多年以來債主尚未償還的債券，加上利息，作為鶴齡應得的那一份，鶴齡也委屈地應承下來了。後來那些債券，大部分都沒辦法索取，鶴齡因此陷入極端貧困之中。這是乾隆丙午（1786）年發生的事。         這一年，鶴齡的兒子陳三立，在鄉試考中舉人。我有一位同年名叫李步玉，他和陳鶴齡住處相近，得知三立考中舉人，說：「皇天終究還是沒有虧待好心的人。」 淳樸得福         御史胡牧亭先生講了一個故事：他的家鄉有一位富翁，這人並不善於賺錢謀生，但他的財富總像是用不完，他不懂得調養身體，但他一輩子也沒得過什麼大病，有時碰到災禍，也會意外得到解決。         一次，偶然有人扶乩召仙，鄉人就以這個疑問來請教乩仙。         乩仙判語說：「這位富翁上輩子，他淳樸敦厚，絲毫沒有與人計較之心；他悠悠忽忽，從來沒有患得患失之慮；他雖然落落漠漠，但待人平等，心中無愛無憎；他襟懷坦蕩，總是直心直行，無偏無私。有人欺侮他，他不與之爭競；有人欺騙他，他不心生巧詐；有人以惡言誹謗他，他既不心懷嗔恨，也不嗔怒於人；有人捏造罪狀陷害他，他也不報復。一生平庸，老死於茅舍，並沒有什麼功德，獨有那顆淳樸善良的心，卻為神明所欣賞，所以降福於他，使他今生終身幸福。」         胡先生所講的這個故事，從情理上說，世間倒真有這種情況。 書名   紀曉嵐寫的因果故事 1.為人施捨財物，救急扶危 叫做善，行善的人，將來準富，因為天不虧人。 2.天理是，明中施捨，暗裏天還，為了義舉盡心竭力，任勞任怨，叫做功，有功於世的人，會有權柄，因為捨己為人是出貴的根。 3.人借行善立功，把性情練得爐火純青。遇逆境都能和顏悅色地忍受，死心化性，才叫做德。有德性的人，才能立住萬古。             因為救人的性是一救萬古。人能做到善功德三個字，就是聖賢了。             好佔便宜的人長陰命（造惡業）；好生怨氣的人消宿命（損福報）；好動性（耍脾氣）的人，消天命（損智慧）。         怨人是苦海，越怨心裏越難過，以致於不是生病，就是招禍。 笑不但除病還能轉命 生氣容易上火，哪能不生病呢？若能不怨人，可以解無量的冤。找好處能生啟發力，能接萬人緣，是消因果的根。 書名   王鳳儀善人行道實錄 歡迎翻印 成為「富翁」的三個要項： 1.多存錢： 也就是「做好事」及「存好心」。 2.少花用： 在心念上要「除惡念」。 在行為上能「少享福」。 3.提高利率（或報酬率）： 【心量放大】，念念為廣大眾生！不斷淨化心靈，放下放下再放下！ 祈願每個人在這個宇宙銀行裡，都能成為大富翁！ 書名   最大銀行 作者   丞捷}

{❤給看這留言的你❤是俊美大大善人尊敬佩服 ❤鞠躬❤祝福你健康平安❤財源廣進❤萬事如意❤ 說話低聲軟語，安詳穩重，寬宏大量，知人優點，遇事能找人好處，有義氣，準有人緣。 知足之人常樂，能忍之士身自安。與其能辯不如能忍。傷害人的事不要說，現在的事做了再說，有多少力量就做多少事，不要心存等待，等待就會落空。 同情心為別人的困苦和可憐處、難處而著想愛心。能理解對方的心情最為可貴，也是最重要的。說話要達到對方的意，就是理解對方的心情。如果不理解對方的可憐處、難處、心理要求和接受能力，只是要求對方像我所想去做，就是苦了對方。不僅事與願違，同時也給對方造成很大壓力，自己也會感到苦惱。 (有同情心可以增加自己財運、福報和逢兇化吉逃過一劫機會）  🥰♥️真的感謝你💯♥️💯好愛心好聰明你真棒💯♥️好寬宏大量好帥你真棒💯♥️尊敬佩服♥️鞠躬 說話和言詞，要善良柔和、守信用，又能為別人著想，說話自然有份量。 多多作積極的鼓勵和讚美，使人感到快樂，產生自信心，就會努力自動自發去學習，讓後來的表現更為優秀。 對人加以尊敬慈愛，體貼關心、同情協助，與人相處盡量保持和藹，經常微笑😊，處處表現有禮貌和體貼，使人感到溫暖和愉快，有機會盡量替人服務。 說話注意口德，不要傷害別人的自尊和名譽，有機會盡量助人遷善改過，建立自信心，教人明白是非善惡，以免誤入歧途。 愛護動物 竇禹鈞常送衣服、常送食物、常捐財物，救濟窮困之人，請老師免費教導小孩讀書，後來，他五個孩子都揚名於世。竇儀（禮部尚書）竇翱（右諫議大夫）竇儼（禮部侍郎）竇侃（右補闕）竇僖（起居郎）         漢朝有位于公，有一次他家大門壞了，于公說：管工，大門可蓋高大一些。管工說：大人，為什麼？于公說：因為我平時處理獄政時，從未冤枉過一個人，將來子孫必定興盛發達！這樣的大門，未來可方便駟馬大車進出！ 後來他的兒子于定國當了宰相，孫子于永侶做了御史大夫。         明朝的趙籍，與人交往時，見到別人有善行，必定逢人到處表揚，這個人聽到了，便愈喜歡更樂意為善。又勸導人說某件事也是善事 ，可以互相勉勵的做；某件事看來像是好事，而實際上是壞事，我們不可以做。 趙籍利用表揚人的善行時，兼勸眾人行善時；並在勸善中兼勸阻人們為惡 。趙籍遏惡揚善，終身行之不倦，享有高壽，且名列仙籍登仙去。         宋朝韓琦，當主國政時，讀書人每天以文章獻給他，好的就抄起來背誦，並說：「我的文章不能作得比他更好!」至於差的，就親自藏起來，不給人看。有人做善事就說：「這人是君子!」 韓琦說：「現在人才，獎勵提拔，還怕不能振作，哪容得稍有挫折!如果責惡過於嚴格，就會斷絕他自新之路，那麼就會自暴自棄，我身為宰相要為朝廷培養人材，所以看到他人的得失，就如自己的得失。」 韓琦後來五福均得，其子封為王爵，其女為帝后，子孫代代為官，南宋末年，還有作宰相的人。 別人灰心的時候，一句鼓勵的話，能使人絕處逢生；別人失望的時候，一句讚美的話，能使人重見光明。 看到都是別人的優點，心裏存在別人的優點，就是存正能量，能吸引錢運和身體健康福報。 做人處世，心存厚道，不要得理不饒人，擺出一付氣勢凌人的樣子。所謂：「話不可說完、事不可作絕、勢不可用盡」，凡事要留退路。 (凡事若過於極端、絕斷，不留點空間作為後路，必有後患。) 飲食七分飽，精神才會好；講話留三分，日後相見好。 (少吃得長壽，可以省時間，省下時間拿來幫助別人，別人強過自己，要敬重他，向他學習。多多原諒別人，把度量放大，就會得到多多福報。) 助人者，人恆助之；念起善心，自然有善果。 (人幫人必得人幫，天會安排另外一個人出現來幫助你。生出善心可自救，又可以救人。) 貪求或易怒是煩惱，知足、感恩、惜福是快樂。 (凡事要懂得內斂，不要過於招搖，免得遭人嫉妒，惹事上身，傲長則人厭，縱欲則傷神，志滿則遭怨，樂極則生悲。) 孝順父母要一生說話和品德，不要讓父母擔心，能懂得改過也是懂得做一件善事，讓父母得到安慰。 自己要會主動去做會學習，不要讓父母操心。 🥰❤💯謝謝你愛心💯❤感謝你愛心💯❤感恩❤尊敬佩服❤鞠躬}

{Marshmello's "Alone" is the perfect anthem for all the lonely hearts out there! 🎧💔 The beat drops like a warm hug, reminding us that even in solitude, we can find strength and connection. The visuals are a stunning journey that perfectly capture the feeling of longing and hope. 🌌✨ Plus, who knew a giant marshmallow could be so relatable? If this song doesn’t make you want to dance through your feelings, I don’t know what will! Let’s embrace the vibe and remember—we’re never truly alone! 🎶✨}

{I love this song for the fact that it reflects well my phase in 2022 in the 8th grade, when I was practically alone, I even had a friend but I still felt lonely, because he missed the most from coming to school, today I don't have any, but I accepted Jesus and today I gained a father who is God and two friends the Holy Spirit and Jesus,  It is very worthwhile to accept Jesus, send hail to Brazil.}

{I think these people create a bad perception by all such things after some years you will watch some other and good thing is that it's still new so you ask yourself what about old time and some use to say you have to change by that time you might be living alone you are jobless you don't know how to manage your life see some friend of yours nicely dropped in good cloths and happy with everyone and you find pain with your life your dad or mom has expired you might be living with what has happened in past and nice thing is no one listens your past they all say change dear assume you earn 500usd and your expenses are more than 2500usd where do you get rest of money either you do some job or some innocent at home who knows world more than you Some day you will realise what I spent one day wasting doing stupid thing ruined my whole life what if I had financial or mental support possibly tommorow you might know but I don't know when that tommorow is going to come so living a neutral life with poor and innocent who knows more about world matters most rest all is just stupid imagine a bungalow but you do not have job your loved one or your pet cat or dog all matters I think he or she might be a fool who lives with new perception possibly god might teach you amen😊😊😊😊😊}

{Ну, что сказать? Эта песня просто зашибись! Как только её включил, сразу захотелось вылезти на улицу и отпраздновать жизнь на полную катушку. Мелодия такая, что ноги сами в пляс идут — не можешь сидеть на месте, прям всё внутри бурлит! Тексты — это отдельная тема! Здесь всё по делу: про жизнь, про разборки, про то, как пацаны есть пацаны. Чётко, конкретно и без всякой фигни! Слушаешь и понимаешь — вот оно, настоящее, работать так работать, веселиться так веселиться. Блин, порой так прямо накрывает этим настроением, что захочется в общем плане отрываться с друзьями! Когда начинается припев, у тебя просто нет шансов не подпевать. Для таких моментов и создаётся качественная музыка. Задор, драйв — вот что заставляет эту песню крутиться на repeat. Она просто заряжает, как хороший пивчанский вечер с друзьями. Короче, "Пацанский Хит" — это не просто песня, это заряд энергии и хороший настроек на всю неделю! Всем рекомендую заценить, не пожалеете!Ну, что сказать? Эта песня просто зашибись!

{As a person who's never had a single person in their life, not one friend and not one family member, constantly on the move, living everywhere, working 10 jobs every year, never turning to substances or alcohol, just dealing with what I am. I urge you to look past the solitude, I know it's hard, but that's what separates you from everyone else, you aren't afraid of the hard path. Keep your head up, and remember, all those people who criticize you, wouldn't last 30 days in your shoes. Be proud of yourself for fighting and being you. You still have a long lonely road ahead, i can tell you from experience that NO ONE is coming to save you. Your in your own. It's a small world, maybe I'll see you around.}

{La verdad es que me acabo de alejar de mis amigos y familiares y comencé a sentirme muy enfermo y solo como si no perteneciera a mi nuevo mundo. Todo estaba pasando tan rápido, realmente no podía entender dónde estaba o quién era, pero todo lo que sabía era que me sentía solo. Con el vídeo musical, realmente queríamos enviar un mensaje. Nadie sabe cómo te sientes, ya sea que estés nostálgico, lejos de tus amigos y familiares, o si simplemente no eres como todos los demás ... está bien. El propósito total del proyecto Marshmello y Mellogang es reunir a personas de todos los rincones del mundo y crear una familia ... una familia con la que todos podamos contar para que nunca nos hagan sentir como si estuviéramos solos.}

{To me ... Its not a struggle to be good but to feel good is a mountainous challenge. He doesn't speak because they won't get it. Everyone is unique and it my case people  speaking and said vibrations from inside the year you are in are not the best thing. Listen to this as well. His talents exposed inspires and affects more people than a typical job. Is it not God on him. So until a person becomes rich they don't really get respect OR   sound bits OR non gaslit weeks.}

{Es gibt Wettervorhersagen im Fernsehen oder im Radio, die die Aussichten für die nächsten Tage liefern. Der Winter kündigt sich durch Frost an. Draußen ist es sehr kalt und Schnee bedeckt die Landschaft. Mit dem Beginn des Frühlings schmelzen das Eis und der Schnee, da die Temperaturen steigen und es warm wird. Im Frühling gibt es viele sonnige Tage. Die Sonne brennt im Sommer auf der Haut. Ab und zu blitzt und donnert es heftig, Gewitter ziehen auf. Meistens ist es sehr heiß und trocken. Das ändert sich mit der Ankunft des Herbstes. Alles kühlt ab und das Wetter wird rauer. Wolken bedecken den Himmel und dichter Nebel erschwert die Sicht. Es regnet häufiger. Nach dem Regen bilden sich oft bunte Regenbögen am Himmel. Manchmal kommt es zu Hagelfällen. Die Tage im Herbst sind oft windig und nass. Wenn der Wind sehr stark bläst, entsteht ein Sturm. Mit dem Herbst bereitet sich die Natur wieder auf den Winter vor.}

{I remember listening to this when i was eight years old and being enthralled. Being able to relate to this song, being autistic and getting severely bullied from when i started school in 2016, all the way to now. I'm 14 now, and doing better. I hope I can send this message to a future me who will forget about this comment, and come back to it and still listen to it. I hope to achieve my dream of being an author one day (Asking my future self if I did) I'm sending love and hope and extra morale to anyone who reads this comment. I know why you're here, and I relate. <3 from 2024}
