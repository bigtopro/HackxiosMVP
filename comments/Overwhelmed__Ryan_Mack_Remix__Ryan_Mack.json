I just want to remind you. No matter how hard it gets, please stay strong. Take care of yourself. You can\u0027t go into a battle already wounded. You can\u0027t wave the white flag without trying your hardest. This will all be over soon. And hey. If you ever need to take another break, I\u0027m always here. Helping people is my specialty. They always find their way, one way or another. You can come sit down with me any time. I\u0027ll try to lend some advice, or just an ear to listen. And if this is your last time visiting me, I\u0027m proud of you. My job is done. Go take on life with all your energy, and remember that you have one soul always cheering you on.

  "Here’s the thing, everybody has anxiety it’s a natural emotion. BUT others ( like me ) have it more severe and it’s gonna be different for everyone, same may bite/pick their nails, bounce their leg, etc I personally just give a blank stare when I’m overwhelmed or a twitch my arm. I’m lucky enough that my teachers have picked up on it and are very assistive? ( I can’t think of a good word lol )  ( little story that’s optional )  Last year my ELA teachers where the only ones who knew I had anxiety since I would leave their class early every Thursday to go to therapy. ( I had them as my last class ) I get very stressed during fire drills due to the loud sound. And as my primary ELA teacher was one of the grade leaders she was in charge of taking attendance, radioing the other ‘sectors’ etc she learned to pick up on the signs I was scared which was typically me giving a blank stare towards the talk. All she would do was just look at me and then smile which I thought was actually really helpful \u003c3",

I aspire to do as good then go beyond what they are. Please do the same, it helps trust me I know.",
  "correct. Try having a massive fear of something and turn it into a massive fear of everything. Panic attacks are fucking annoying Constantly worrying if I said something wrong But I never tell people because I worry about burdening them Worry constantly over the little things I\u0027m terrified of driving because, despite being supposedly a natural according to my dad, I\u0027m terrified of hitting someone or damaging property whether my own or someone else\u0027s property. I get motion sick in cars even if I\u0027m not driving because I\u0027m constantly worried about if the car is gonna crash And it\u0027s ironic because I also don\u0027t care if I die. Joy of having both huh? And just like anxiety people tell people with depression to just \u0027be happy\u0027 and \u0027it\u0027ll get better\u0027 WHEN!? When does it get better!? Because I keep fucking getting told this and it hasn\u0027t fucking happened yet! People say 18 is when you can be happy finally but I turned 18 ages ago! When is it getting better!? When!? I\u0027m now having to take medication for all of this when is supposedly should\u0027ve been gone by now. Anxiety and depression fucking sucks, man. Having anxiety and depression is like- I\u0027m scared and tired at the same time. I fear failure, but have no urge to do anything. I want friends, but hate social interaction. I wanna be alone, but don\u0027t wanna be lonely. It\u0027s feeling everything at once then feeling nothing.",

Also something you should know, you don\u0027t need a medical diagnosis to know you have anxiety, it\u0027s pretty self diagnosable 50 or so of the time, whatever the statistic is, but obviously it\u0027s good to check and get it medically diagnosed, especially because people are assholes about it unless you get it medically diagnosed.",

  "i really wish this was on Spotify but i understand that it probably won\u0027t because of reasons with music copyright and stuff like that but man do i relate to this song so much, it perfectly shows why its hard for me to fall asleep because im just laying in my bed every night thinking about everything whether it be that time that i fell or the time that i stuttered or that i just felt awkward and shy, same with me wanting to post stuff on YouTube and having my dreams, like i want to make animatics and make videos and i get ideas for them but when i sit down and start trying to draw or whatever is when i slow down and i just think \"this wont be good enough for anyone to like, my art may be good but its not good enough, how am i supposed to finish this when its hard for me to finish anything else?\" and i slowly drop the idea because of that, especially when i pause the project to try and get some sleep because \"its too late and you need sleep\" (from my mom) and im starting again the next day and i feel like i dont want to try and work on it anymore. its just really hard to try and do something you want to do but you cant because of yourself, you only feeling comfortable with doing things that aren\u0027t a real risk like rewatching shows and movies and youtube videos because you can\u0027t put yourself in the mindset to do something for yourself and put in effort and make something that i can either be really proud of or something that i\u0027ll look down upon in the future and just delete it after a week. im getting an idea of an animatic/animation for this but im getting doubts about if i\u0027d be able to do a decent job on it or even do it justice for this amazing remix/cover of a song that i really relate to. i might try and make an animation for this but knowing myself i might chicken out of it. guess i\u0027ll just come back to listen again whenever im feeling down or just want to hear this again and i\u0027ll try to listen to your other songs :)",

How about a more encouraging phrase like \"you\u0027ll make it through this, breathe more slower\" or \"think of a happy place; think of something that\u0027s calming to you\" These might help with your panic attack.

  "I just wanted to say- as a friend of someone with severe anxiety issues (as well as having them myself to a lesser degree)  I want it to be clear that when someone tells you to relax its really not always just an easy go-to phrase to get around giving proper advice. Honestly I often use it as a precursor to a longer discussion, as a sort of \"Hey. I\u0027m here.\" I know some people out there aren\u0027t genuine when they say \"just relax\" or similar things but once in a while people will truly wish to help you. Its true, your mind doesn\u0027t work the same as others, and it may be hard for them to understand but there are people out there that want to comfort you and let you know that things really will be okay in the end.",
  "Bruhhh why isn\u0027t this on Spotifyyy",
  "So when will you release this to the public (on Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)",

  "Opinion:  I loved this a lot more ✨ than the other one that says  \"So just don\u0027t get overwhelmed\" (I like it too just that this one gets me and other people who are going through this and their tired of hearing the same things).",

  "I can relate to this to much .",

  "Put this on Spotify 🙌🙌",
  "Alright here\u0027s a story : me and my friend was listening to this when it were first released. That night we were singing it but forgot some of the lyrics so we were trying to remember, at that exact moment a guy came up to us and started to finish the song. His name was Eugene and now my friend and him are dating! Thanks to you my friend got her first relationship :] 🙏",

  "@@fightingwriter25 thats what I would like to know. This story just sounds so fake.",
  "@@fightingwriter25 He\u0027s just a random guy who walked up to us and sang with us, then he got close to my friend and they started dating after a few months of getting to know each other",

  "Did no one else notice how this man is singing this whole song in like one breath (Sounds like it)",
  "He\u0027s cutting out the sound when he breathes",
  "Definitely pre recorded and heavily produced, but still amazing",
  "Might be the point, it is called overwhelmed and that\u0027s sort of how it feels.",
  "He ain’t cutting it out he’s just inhaling real quickly and softly so it sounds like he ain’t breathing. Same applies to rappers like Eminem.",
  "I generally thought (This was a thing I learnt whist in music ) He was doing this silent breath thing so let\u0027s say you\u0027re singing a really long line / or something like falalala that goes on for ages where your pitch needs to go higher or  needs to change but you\u0027re almost out of breathe so you do a quick and it\u0027s usually  un-noticed breath it\u0027s pretty good to do if you\u0027re in a group as long as you don\u0027t do it at the same time",

  "This makes me really happy to listen to this! I really loved the original version of overwhelmed... and then the remix came out telling me to just \"not get overwhelmed\" as if I could control the shitty things in my head. And then Serpant promoted it and it felt like they just made a song that capitalised on my anxiety. It really sucked because I realise that they probably didn\u0027t and that promoting the song didn\u0027t actually mean that but it still felt that way. I really like your remix alot more.  It\u0027s alot more cathartic and realistic at least for me. and I just can\u0027t convey how much I love it. Thankyou so much for making this remix!",
  "I LOVE THIS OMGGG",

  "I-......I don\u0027t think this has anything to do with Christian gates?",
  "Why compare two different artists doing their OWN remix of this song.... In my opinion if you read through Christian Gates lyrics it\u0027s not trying to disregard anxiety he is showing support and trying to be encouraging to this ~theoretical~ person. Sometimes that\u0027s all you can do for someone going through it whether it be anxiety, depression or other mental illness.",

Feels like I\u0027m somebody else I get overwhelmed In my mind Late at night Overthinking everything in my life Just wondering if I\u0027m doing anything right All these demons inside start to really come ALIVE! OH MY! I get anxious and I don\u0027t know why I can hear my dreams calling me But all these doubts are haunting me  Oh why\u0027s it always right before I fall asleep that, I get overwhelmed so easily My anxiety Creeps inside of me Makes it hard to breathe What\u0027s come over me? Feels like I\u0027m somebody else I get over....well well well Would you look at that Another person telling me that I should \"just relax\" \"Calm down and take it easy everything will be okay\" Yeah sure, Cause that\u0027s what they all say BUT OH, MY MIND Isn\u0027t really my friend sometimes I can hear my dreams calling me But all these doubts are haunting me  Oh why\u0027s it always right before I fall asleep that, I get overwhelmed so easily My anxiety Creeps inside of me Makes it hard to breathe What\u0027s come over me?

  "This made me actually tear up. I love how accurate it is.. Christian Gates probably doesn\u0027t know what bad anxiety is like since, y\u0027know- \"So just don\u0027t get overwhelmed\"? How are you supposed to \"just not get overwhelmed\"? That\u0027s like saying \"Sick? Just get better.\" Or even better, \"Drowning? Just breathe!\" Your version is the one I\u0027ve been waiting for.",
  "I always get so mad whenever that version gets in my fyp, is actually insulting to anyone with anxiety, and its so dangerous, cause it\u0027s validating a really awful mindset and invalidating how serious anxiety actually is.",
  "@@isa196954  same that version almost gave me a panic attack once when I wasn’t feeling great and it just showed up in a TickTock compilation haven’t listen to the full version  no plans to,I hate it with a passion  this version though it’s awesome",
  "More people need to see and understand this",
  "I was hoping he was just saying that ironically like \"oh yea just dont get anxious duh, cuz no ones ever thought of that before\"",
  "Christian Gates said it as like ignore whatever makes you feel overwhelmed that you can ignore. As if there’s people that overwhelm you then don’t pay attention to them, if going out makes you overwhelmed then stay inside. It’s really not that deep, but in the end it’s just a song, some songs are racist and comical and people don’t talk about feeling discriminated. And next time if something makes you feel uncomfortable then just don’t watch it, you have a choice; which is kinda what his point was! Have a good day everyone! Stay double negative :)",
  "@@jayfromspaceee sometimes it not that simple, as im forced to do many things that make me very uncomfortable daily. Such as talk to others which is kind of hard to avoid. I totally understand what you mean, and im not trying to be hateful or rude. Im just intending to say that sometimes things that make us uncomfortable are things we cant avoid and things that are just naturally part of life. And avoiding them can make it hard to live",
  "@@crazycookie294 as an adult, I have anxiety, adhd and extreme depression and I did everything possible to work from home and avoid most of anything that triggers me. I get being younger it’s hard to achieve that but yeah it’s possible. Stay strong and you can get that too or even at some point overcome it, just stay strong",
  "@@crazycookie294 Exactly and sometimes we’ve been ignoring it sometimes for years and we just can’t anymore and someone saying  “so just don’t get overwhelmed” it’s kind of insulting to our intelligence  I understand the song wasn’t meant to be insulting and I do avoid that song but just because some songs are bad and racist or whatever doesn’t mean we shouldn’t strive for better music (whether it be understanding or accurate )",
  "I also suffer from anxiety and depression because I have parents with schizophrenia/bipolar schizoaffective and I actually got emotional hearing Christian Gates version. It made me feel like there is someone there willing to fight with and for you.. I personally feel you took the lyrics the wrong way but I guess it\u0027s up to you how to take those lyrics. If you take it too literal \"just don\u0027t get overwhelmed\" then I mean I guess I can see what you guys are saying but to me it\u0027s showing how he wants this ~theoretical~ person to feel better and \"fuck what they say\". I think you really have to read inbetween what he\u0027s saying to understand the context. And it\u0027s just as bad to assume whether someone does or does not suffer from what you deem as severe anxiety because of the way you may infer the lyrics /:\u003e",
  "@@CassieSmits I understand and appreciate what you’re saying but reading between the lines is a tall order for me I’m autistic i’m sure that song has helped some people though I’m not trying to say it it should be canceled or ostracized I just think it’s important to understand that each situation is so terribly different that one solution couldn’t possibly work for all of them",
  "@@jadetryingtochill1259 Ugh I accidentally deleted my comment so sorry if I\u0027m spamming you \u003e\u003c Awww I understand and I also agree with what you\u0027re saying. I\u0027m sorry that you go through what you go through.. just think we need to see how things can be inferred differently by different people even if we may be going through the same or similar feelings/events. Also the last part was more for OP as he said \"Christian Gates probably doesn\u0027t know what bad anxiety is\" because reverse uno card: that\u0027s dismissive to a person that we don\u0027t even know, y\u0027know? The beauty of music is that it is open to interpretation for better or for worse! c:",
  "@@CassieSmits yeah sometimes it’s important to remember that we’re all human even when you’ve got people in your life and you really don’t think they are sometimes you give them second chances and you have second thoughts about that but it’s important to remember that they’re probably doing their best (unless they’re straight up abusive)",
  "@@jadetryingtochill1259 Wow that\u0027s crazy because what you just said is what I\u0027m going through! I tend to think people aren\u0027t there for me but that\u0027s the pessimist in me taking over when in actuality I know people are just trying their best...

I would have a constant sinking feeling in my chest, and whenever I would say something I shouldn\u0027t have I would be excruciating pain(It was all mental). After college I got over it, but in high school I almost killed myself because I felt like I wasn\u0027t doing anything right. All I can say is that anxiety can cause depression and both together is a deadly combination.",
