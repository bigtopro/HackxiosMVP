That means I can see him shortly when I get home from school and it\u0027s driving me crazy. I have severe depression and anxiety disorders, I\u0027m doing badly at school because I have absolutely no motivation, I\u0027m currently training to make something of myself but not to the gym because I have social anxiety, I can\u0027t even ride the bus properly when there are strangers on it, I can\u0027t approach women because I\u0027m too shy, I made a firm resolution yesterday that I have to change something, I\u0027m going to try to do something from now on so that I like myself and maybe one day I can make my wife and maybe just maybe my children happy and of course my dad too because he does everything for me, maybe I\u0027ll come back here one day to say that I\u0027ve made it, take care of yourselves, love you❤",

  "She meant everything to me and more. Even though we were long distance, we were so intimate, shared everything with each other. But a lot changed in a small period of time. We got into an argument, and wanting to be right got the better of me, my words hurt the only person I ever truly cared about; my sweetheart of over 3 years, nearing 4. I tried fixing it, fixing us, but she changed, I broke something inside of her. Het sweetness, her innocence, it seemed like it had all just disappeared. She was being short with me, which she never was before. We cried together, we went through a lot together, but I thoroughly believed we\u0027d come out of this together, stronger than ever before. For a brief moment everything seemed to get better. I started to believe again, to have hope we\u0027d get through this. We spoke of a house of our own, a brief glipse of a future, together. She told me she wanted to bring her teddybears, which made me smile. It reminded me of her innocence. It told me that somewhere inside, the girl I knew was still in there. One day she vanished, the night before she asked if we could go to bed, I was recovering from a surgery at that time. I wasn\u0027t really tired but for her I, I told her alright, because she hadn\u0027t been sleeping well lately, I thought she needed to rest as well. The day after I waited for her, all day. Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, months turned into almost a year. My sweetheart has left me, with worries, with doubts, with questions, but most importantly without goodbye. The questions still haunt me. Why? Why did you leave without saying goodbye? Why did you leave me on my own? Did you not see any other way out for us? Was all of it, everything we talked about, day and night, just a lie? Yesterday I saw her again, for a brief moment. She was playing a game, I joined one of her friends hoping to find her in there, and I did. Saw her running happilly after this other guy, when she saw me, she froze in place... and left. My heart has been torn out, I don\u0027t know how else I could describe this feeling, this gutwrenching feeling. I thought that with time, the pain would fade, it didn\u0027t, it only got worse. Why did I go looking for her? Has she already moved on from me? Did she forget about me? The thought of her being with someone other than me, it haunts me. A year ago I confessed this fear to her when we went through it all. She reassured me, told me that she doesn\u0027t want a new relationship; with anyone. I just wish she\u0027d talk to me one more time, tell me that she was okay, even if it was something as simple as \"Hi\". She meant the world to me, and still does. I don\u0027t think i\u0027ll ever be able to move on from her. I never loved someone the way I loved her. It was real, and I know it was the same for her as well. I feel so alone, so empty, I lost my sense of purpose in life, and it hurts, so much...",

  "Akon’s ‘Lonely’ is a timeless anthem that perfectly captures the raw pain of regret and isolation after losing someone you love. The haunting melody combined with Akon’s heartfelt vocals makes the feeling of loneliness almost tangible. What makes this song so powerful is its honesty-Akon doesn’t just sing about heartbreak, he confesses his own mistakes and the consequences of taking love for granted. Even years after its release, ‘Lonely’ resonates deeply because everyone can relate to that moment of realizing what you’ve lost and wishing you could turn back time. It’s more than a hit; it’s a universal story of love, loss, and the human need for connection",

  "Hello guys.. You see in life,  you\u0027ll always get old and die. But where do you go after you die? Will you spend eternity with God or with the Devil and his demons ? This is why it is very important to live for Jesus Christ the savior of the world.        Jesus Loves you so much that He came to die for us all but on the 3rd day He resurrected and He\u0027s sitting at the right hand of God the Father.         When He comes back to judge the world, He\u0027ll give eternal life to those who accept Him and are not ashamed to confess Him to the whole world 🌎.        This is the time to repent from every sin and wicked way and turn to Jesus. He will redeem you and save you from the great disaster that is coming upon this world. Jesus Christ is the only way to Heaven. He is the Way, Truth and Life. He is coming back. Jesus Loves you ❤️",

  "This is one reason why I think my ex kept coming back to me after breakups and ghosting. He was just lonely and wanted someone to talk to.. sad for the both of us.. but I\u0027m so happy I walked away officially. I\u0027m so much happier. Also, I grew up on Akon. I miss him so much.  (Can\u0027t believe Kat Graham was a minor in this video while Akon was 32 😅)",
  "Somehow this is true, but this dispute never will have a winner because men like women and women, men, period. Doesn\u0027t matter if you girls die for me, the counterpart of men are young women a.k.a Light. Akon is almost a girl w/ my body hence why he also doesn\u0027t care  If this world was more populated with \u0027Negative\u0027 anti-matter/alpha male souls, you girls would be blocked of being older. Although watching stuff about, women going for Black men in porns, IRL, other countries, hoping those like elder women, the problems you girls are putting alpha males thru(They have to lie, set rules when they are clearer, policing, respecting you younger, etc) yet being called all sort of names, sucks. There is also the ethnic factor. Black and White in the universe should have the same level of power, but they are spread across ethnic groups, down here. That creates all sorts of pick ups and choices.  Although this is also weird that it\u0027s not balanced(as matter and anti-matter in the universe). I meant, I\u0027m black but much younger than Akon (heterosexual, that\u0027s an alpha male spirit who likes vagina in a small/feminine body) but what counts etnically is, the females need to have a bit of admixture so we are able to choice a partner better (Avril Lavigne looks more attractive to me in her MV\u0027s thumbnail \u0027Complicated\u0027 than avarage European girls, because she looks more Afrikan a.k.a similar to me) for exemple. The same when I went younger.. Black Girls a little mixed up were my choice, but it never worked due their different preferences.  In general doesn\u0027t matter, way too many mixes, combos and different affairs going on",

Didn’t last for at least 3 weeks. 2020:  single 2021: single 2022: single 2023: got attentions from married women but stayed single 2024: single 2025: single (stay tone for updates…) Edit: dating sites were the place to go when I wanted to meet a girl back in 2016 and so on, but now I’m no longer using any social media as a dating site because of how toxic and unresponsive women on that site not to mention prices. I am an introvert man and sometimes have a hard time to talk and get exhausted from talking if it ain’t interesting. I would not be surprised if next year that I don’t find a nice relationship with a woman. Peace to you and thanks for reading this.",

  "Nah, you girl need to pick males not so masculine, so you will get your money/softer features.... Why instead of choicing BBCs aren\u0027t you girls going for smaller/less hostil males? Yeah, that can be black skinned as well.",
  "Someone who mixes with me for example, a Soft Black Male(2 or 3 times softer than Akon) will probably be happier, more feminine featured, etc. All a girl has to do is to choose softer evils. Going for BC, BBCs and hostile/retarded males waiting to become a Happy Cinderella is being way too naive. Universal, REAL males, are softer, any ways. We are less hostil, we love females, etc. A real Male, if it wish to move his arm to hit you with his true power would desintegrate you (or any one).",
  "Hence why Males date women... Black Holes are infinitely bigger than you, females, and, stronger. The bigger/stronger you are, more delicate/less hostil you also are. The smaller you are, the more hostil instead.",

  "You Are Not Alone, Keep Moving Forward! At some point in life, we all feel lonely. It may seem like no one understands, no one cares, and no one is there for us. But the truth is— you are not alone! Your existence has its own value in this world. Maybe everything feels dark right now, and nothing seems to be going right. But remember, after the darkest night comes the morning, after the storm comes the sunshine. What You Do Matters! Your dreams, your feelings, and your thoughts—all of them matter. If you ever feel like no one understands you, take time to understand yourself. Talk to yourself, awaken the strength within you. Keep Moving, Don\u0027t Stop! Never let go of your dreams. If today feels difficult, tomorrow it will turn into strength. Believe in yourself, because you can do it! Small Things That Can Help You Feel Better: ✅ Find small moments of happiness every day. ✅ Learn something new or focus on your hobbies. ✅ Talk to your loved ones and share your feelings. ✅ Exercise and spend some time in nature. ✅ Love yourself, because you are worthy. Final Words: There is unlimited strength within you. Just believe in yourself— you are not alone, you matter, and you can do this! Keep moving forward, because your story is not over yet!",

So now, no excuses. Even if i face rejection, I don\u0027t care. It\u0027s better than staying drunk with my friends, right ? I\u0027ll reach out to that girl who said 2 months ago. \"Can I be the first person you kiss for the new year ?\" How could I be so clueless fuck. I\u0027m stupid. She is so cute, fuck I missed on so bad. She was scared of fireworks and almost draped into my arms after midnight. I need to call a date.

  "Not lonely since 2007. I thank God for my amazing other half. Going on 18 years this April 13th. We were married on a Friday the 13th all those years ago and I\u0027ve never looked back since. Being married to someone you can get along with (even though arguments get heated) we still come together and make it work. We were told we\u0027d never be able to conceive a child after 10 years of marriage we did. Then a year and a half later we found out we were expecting a second child. First a little girl then a little boy and we couldn\u0027t have been more blessed. God adds and there\u0027s no doubt about that. I hope that anyone looking for a husband or wife finds them and is as happy as I am. I\u0027m not lonely anymore but blessed beyond belief.  Ask God for your spouse and He will find you the perfect one. I did and I\u0027m glad for it.",
