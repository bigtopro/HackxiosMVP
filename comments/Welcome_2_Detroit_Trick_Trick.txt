Nah, it's the same, we been laborin' for years I know it took way longer than nine months But fuck it, it's all in due time I turned a blunt to a roach, with dreams of bein' a Beatle Don't want to, I need to, ya gotta learn to keep it cerebral When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel (let's go), lil' bitch!

I still never ABC this shit Mainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit (I would be the shit) And if I ever end up escapin' these streets I swear that I would stay here still And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler Break all of my friends out of here And take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer Peel off back to the same block that we came from On a rampage too crazy for me to flip What's makin' you think I need a switch? 'Cause I'm Adrian Peterson When he's ragin' and heated and On the way to go beat his kid? On a track get spanked like he just did (Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch Sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me To do features and them cyphers on BET, 'cause if I wasn't me I prob'ly wouldn't Wanna play with me neither, shit Seems to be reachin' its fever pitch Hundred and eighty degrees in here Shoulder blade full of cedar chips MC's just bit off more than they can chew Like a face full of Swedish Fish Or Lorena with two penises Hateful and geniusness inconvenience And for the record, you don't want this type of static In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it May consider tryna reinsulate your windows May be in for another crazy winter 'Cause so cold in the D, it is As days begin to tick away, but ain't this really What made me into the angry bitter blonde? But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs? Don't make me unleash this shit, release this pit May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with you, but ain't shit changin' It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter With a potato peeler And mushed her face into the entertainment center It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again Or the Bermuda Triangle and Attempted to make a safe descent Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here? And if they mention us Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (Static) I swear I love my city, I just want less (Static) see me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (Static) Detroit versus everybody What up though? It's the godfather Trick Trick You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on That means Detroit versus everybody!

{This song let us know Detroit rappers were in line for the number one spot. At the time I’d still put them 1B and has to be said ; Big Sean’s bars were so good .Detroit has so much talent . Fast forward I have to say In 2025 they’re number one, surpassing New York rappers. This is coming from a New Yorker who’s a big fan of lyricist. Hope they bring the art form back to where it was. I have a lot of issues to what comes out today. Like that song dissing Drake ? Why is that special ? In the late 90’s 2000’s it would have never even made an underground DJ Kay Slay clip let alone one of his mix tapes. Em is the GOAT .}

Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years I know it took longer than 9 months, but fuck it, it's all in due time I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though One, two I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful This is just part 1, wait 'til the sequel [Hook: Dej Loaf] Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static I swear I love my city, I just want a little static See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static Detroit vs. Everybody [Verse 3: Danny Brown] Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat Just a step away from felon, that's why they call it the D On your [?], reason for all of this honesty Honestly no honor roll, but honor the Phantom stripper pole Cause I'm a Lynwood nigga, them young niggas say Put a sack on your head, you bleed out like [?] And to think our hood harder then I might break the door Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Molly In a blink I'll hit your kisser, bet you ass ain't rememberin' They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman I [?] but I ain't [?] Cough up a line, 313 where I'm from Zan got me cross eyed like [?] And these niggas try to copy, [?] It's us vs them, Detroit vs Everybody [Verse 4: Eminem ] Lately it seems as if it's me against the world Like it was before my life became a movie And they usually use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with But I flip that script like AB filler Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script I ain't bein' conceited But I made it to radio, eat a dick I still never ABC the shit Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla I was daydreamin' one day that I would be the shit And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage You crazy for me to flip What's makin' you think I need a switch? I'm Adrian Peterson When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid On the track I spank like he just did (DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch Sick of bein' treated like me and shit Jesus, I can see why people stop callin' me to do features And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me, I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch 180 degrees in here Trying to wait for the cedar chips MCs bit off more than they can chew like a base full of Swedish Fish On a reign with two penises Hateful and genius, this inconvenience And for the record, you won't want this kind of static in your life When I'm makin' you cling to it They consider tryna reinsulate yah when it's maybe in for another crazy winter It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde Sick of bein' underdog Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with your relation, changin' it It's still the same and Shady's still a lady killer Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety center Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated could be danger Did you make arrangements with the gangsters when you came here? And I came to kill 'em [Hook: Dej Loaf] Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static I swear I love my city, I just want a little static See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static Detroit vs. Everybody [Outro: Trick Trick] What up though, it's the godfather Trick Trick. You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on. That means Detroit vs. Everybody! Hey Em let me get that instrumental take it down to the hood, let the little homies get this remix crackin'. Detroit!}

{Em I'm still trying to figure this shit out. This is huge. Whiteys... ukraine... wow... your a fuckin saint. Literally you amaze the fuck out of me. Save us keep saving us and give so many mfs justice. You bad mf you should be the god damn president! 😂 like I'm going over everything I've ever been obsessed with and studied in music. Then this diddy shit just mapped it all out. You literally left a trail silently but now so loudly in every song there is bread crumbs. I don't give a fuck if you stabbed your babysitter killed a mf (which i don't think you ever have your pure) your light and the light is winning. "Use this gospel" God I'm so close or on the way to breaking all this shit down. Thank you Shakespeare for being a man of god!!! Fuck me, fuck your mother shit even fuck a man if that's your thing (it ain't lol) I'm just saying you are hands down the baddest mf who has stayed silent since proof and even before that. You know everything and you still have the courage to use your words for the good and it may just save the whole fuckin planet. Good vs evil. You em your a warrior a god given soldier. He recruits from the pit.. not the pedestal. And even tho you have a huge thrown you stay humble and good and pure and kind. You're just fucking mind blowing the fuck out of me yet again. Politics wars and pure evil you've seen, been put through and fought and now yall mf rappers and artists are cracking the code. God did... by lil wayne dj Khaled lil wayne and Jay z...... omg jay z protect him. But in ottis redding he said he never going to jail. I pray for b and Jay z no matter what they have done or did god loves those who ask for forgiveness and use their life for the good, being good and fighting the good fight. You literally are so fucking incredible and I miss messaging you on ig hahaha😂 they took that shit away after the stan write in. Lame I need to talk to you. Lol sorry I'm doing it here cause who knows who the fuck reads this shit but I pray you do. Thank you as I said in my og comment on this song... for always standing up and doing the right thing no matter what. Your soul is so pure. I would kill to meet you and fill you in on all my notes and shit and watch you and 50 wayne even drake ye and Jay laugh at me for what I've pieced together thus far. I didn't graduate I had a baby young and I hated history class. Who knew you were wrapping about wars politics gangs justice the light versus the dark. You aren't evil as your song says lol (love the album and when you released it.. just like how you saved mgk from diddy. Funny his bad boy contract went void one day after diddy was raided. You told us and me who was responsible for Tupacs death and now biggies Kim's so on and so forth. What a wieght you have had to carry around fo4 all these fuckin years. I'm gonna stop rambling. Thanks for saving mgk and helping Bieber cope with the fucked off shit he is dealing and has dealt with since he was a just a boy like you. You are an angel a protector and I just love you. So proud of all my fav artists for playing the game and beating it. I cannot fuckin wait to see how god is gonna play this shit out. We don't want jesus to come and destroy the fuckin world there's no need now that God stepped in. And as the lovely but dumb ass taylor swift said... the devil now looks more like an angel. I believe he was the most beloved kinda like Tupac and the 7 deadliest sins kicked in greed wrath pride jealousy vanity control power gluttony war gossip and ya whatever the other 2 are I can't google caus3 I'm listening to game over on replay as well as detroit vs Everybody.

{Eminem love Note continued from Maria Strickland outta Saint Cloud MN Wilson Apts) Crazy, bout the fake babies and ladies, Remotely displacing my motions motivating Praying I don't start spraying, forcing funerals parading, and do a good deed releasing whatever frustrating, anticipating all the dimensions of spacings, where eternally you should be laying}
{Love Note to Eminem from Maria Strickland outta Saint Cloud MN Wilson Apts) Fading, a lonely night spotting a visual a pair necklace pearls, Back when I had a dildo to keep my interest Guided meditation temperance, spontaneous styled princess Still it's hard for booty addictions to compare loyalty against difference  Cloudy in thickness, brown liquids and glass fixated fixes But I'll never regret the time persists, my lips assists, was up against the hits The salivary glands fascinated as I delivered it, Do or did refused to quit Amusement park after the city flies dark, Gradually disregards split parts- apparently someone wasn't ready for this Lingo grains, bagging  unconfidential pain, And the ego stage was just that delirious My personality changed humorous, although me as the stupidest , was motivated enough to stay true to this Coincidentally a stranger mysteriously gives up, and the opticals underneath my eyelids tends to accurately become blurred Again I'm clicked back to myself and the phone with the cracked screen is smeared smudged Enough to live hanging in the verge, and unlock something on these boys and girls taking to the hood meeting thugs Especially since the occasion, my noodles was microwaving, and the dish soap was magically sticky finger staining Vexation playing, strong enough to cause you to go under the kitchen sink and grab the hammer and leave it in a cranial station hanging}
{Love Note to Trick Trick from Maria Strickland outta Saint Cloud MN Wilson Apts) Grimy Wilson, where traffic underseige St. Germain cross street Hwy 10, better familiar the lead Humbly, torso grumbling to cause fresh bleeds Down south trigger, hustler throw dirt in the knees Losers punching out after scissor cuts graze the sleeves You wanna live here, Presendential Brian connected to keys If your verbs swerve artillery,  Proudly accept your personalized weapontry Rainbow 🌈 test running stallions- scheduled appointments prostate body checks T.I. quotes noted- whatever you do you need to do it to death Whenever I decide to drop the last hit- be on the look out for Devo posted in vest}
{Wheaties falling off the shelf, Trap house keepers asleep, no delivery drops to provide en-er-gy Eastside too cold def, Them ishes said it's cold to go and collect - so the baton left in me Swore a vow,  a team advantage to apprehend Clicks loud, heads against the hands Turn face to bricks request to be free from sniper aims to be release Duplicate impostor just lost leads in his game- Get your $300,000 credit limit to order a gold rim to shift upgrades Everybody knows yall don't do nothing cheap, I'll make sure the cost is suited to fit y'all's range Plus you the owner of alit if I'm credit cards, The credit as cores ain't credential enough to swipe in on Ace At the door with Charmin tissues and disinfectant, catch yo girl digging in purse for mace Discrimination isn't my motto, But Budweiser isn't on the list of my dranks Nike and Adidas in a battle, Let's see if the checkmark or stripes sound casino payouts If not, I'll be doing the usual smoking a Marlboro Smooth while the sky smoking wit me under a cloud}
{Eminem you are the GOAT THE BEST TO EVER DO IT.}
{All he knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop (I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?  Royceda59 also shout out 2pac song hail mary.  [Chorus: 2Pac] Come with me! Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die? Lately it seems as if it's me against the world Like it was before my life became a movie me against the world is a 2pac song eminem shout that out on this song so did royce da 5 9 too so what does Eminem do shouts out 2pac too from royce da 5 9 verse. how did no one catch the 2pac shouts out from both Royce and eminem?}
{Jesus Eminem is THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME}
{This song would suck minus that Big sean verse}
{1:49 ... We always put Cat food in Our omelette(s) too. Mostly the canned kind, the kibbles less so..}
{I wish Em and Royce hadnt let the rest of these failures and nobodies on a track with them. These cats dont deserve to have their names spoken in the same breath. If you disagree with this, it automatically means your opinion doesnt matter.}

{I just came to say Danny Brown's verse is hard as fuck, it's like the beat starts on some playful thing then starts getting serious like he's telling you he's not fucking playing don't get it twisted, and he says some shady shit. I coudn't appreciate it at first cause I couldn't get over his voice when I heard it, but now I listened, and realized that he has a verse with Eminem for a reason. Respect Danny Brown, that shit was hard for real}
{Who’s here after the lions dub}
{Honk if you came here after the Lions beat the Rams!!!!}
{listening before we do battle with the rams #LetsGoLions 💙}
{GO DETROIT LIONS!!!}
{It really is DetroitVsEverybody tonight}

{This Eminem has zero chill #eminem 👑}
{This song needs more views, so like the comment, share, re-share, and let's make real old skool hip hop new skool, no expensive cars or actors, this is the best street food to get eatin by}
{Royce Da 5’9’s rhyme schemes are crazy, he rarely rhymes in couplets, you never know where the rhyme will fall in the pocket. It’s hard to pull off but he does it masterfully. Pharoahe Monch is the only other rapper that i’ve heard really master that awkward flow. As for Em, he just takes multi-syllable rhyming to another level. He rhymed the same syllables through that whole long verse. To think of so many words and phrases that rhyme and bring them together how he does is genius.}

{This should be the Red Wings Pistons lions and tigers hype song}
{Marshal's verse: Lately, it seems as if it's me against the world Like it was before my life became a movie And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with But I flipped that script like a refill a Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script I ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio, eat a dick I still never ABC the shit Mainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit And if I ever end up escapin' these streets I swear that I would stay here Still in it, and I'm crazy, I'll always be real Don't make me steal an eighteen wheeler Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer Peel off back to the same block that we came from, on a rampage Too crazy for me to flip What's makin' you think I need a switch? 'Cause I'm Adrian Peterson When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid? On the track get spanked like he just did (Detroit) I can't never leave this bitch Sick of bein' treated like me and shit, but Jesus I can just see why people quit callin' me to do features And them cyphers on BET 'cause if I wasn't me I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch, hundred and eighty degrees in here Shoulder blade full of cedar chips MCs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish Or Lorena with two penises Hateful and genius, this inconvenience And for the record, you won't want this kind of static In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it May consider tryna reinsulate ya windows May be in for another crazy winter 'Cause so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit may even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with your relation, changin' it it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again Or the Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here? And if they mention us}
{The best bars big sean}
{Sean fucking murdered this song.}
{Love the clean up.. thank-you for the help n jacket}
{Now mfr guy just laughed like Madeline. Natirallyndevolves into child exploitation. Every time.}
{Now the woman who was puttying her ass near my face yesterday and looks like the other one trivializing child exploitation did a sibling rivalry move while the other aggressive obsessive black man imitated a fake version of my kid. Bc they are thug criminals. And we aren’t adopting my culture especially without consent. I did t consent to having her depicted in hip hop bc this is the natural result. It always sevaolces into ownership and slave like expectations by hypocrite trying to take my things. I worked for what I have. I’m moving.}
{Another man who is also obsessed with me just imitated my kids ultrasound pic and someone else said sorry. I don’t normalize this or another year of some attempting to use me and my kid for politician advantage or gain. I’m moving in and not losing shit.}
{Yet another black man who has been harassing me frequently is moving his ass in my direction like Ben r’s sibling rivalry. It doesn’t exist.}
{We aren’t using my things without informed consent. Next ten years.}
{Another day more harassment about sibling rivalry that doesn’t exist particularly given info I learners recently! Moving on and disgruntled men don’t have to listen but I’m going a different direction.}
{Lol, Royce first is and was cruel}
{Black people can't even say it like that , he some white conspiracy. Very sneaky}
{Em isz non human some type of experiment 🤔}
{Spending full time having to babysit aggressive and hateful men threatening my kid who think that there’s a sibling rivalry. Not great and no means no. Not losing shot.}
{Эм я тебя люблю}
{Another day another bunch of aggressive men harassing me excessively, referring to  my vagina in demeaning and aggressive ways, and suggesting I lost in a sibling rivalry. And prolonging a madeline vs. Renee story threatening violence bc that was enabled for a decade. I refused and refuse to normalize. Have a great school year!}
{Damn when Detroit rappers were unique}
{Just cooked  the Detroit Pistons On 2k23 while listening to this 😂😂😂}
{Lots of black men vested in sterilizing me. Not great.}
{The male response to me is so sad for them. Moving on.}
{Like I predicted in 2015 & 2016}
{No rivalry. I need to be around ppl who get that. Same with ppl who think me and Madeline or Hailey are competing. Waste of my time and Lolita sheik.}
{royce 59 had the best verse imo each of his bars was hard af. big sean was close too.}

{The men suggesting that there’s a sibling rivalry are also saying sorry and overseeing abortion central. Reid my lips…}
{This better be the detroit lions intro this year}
{I expect someone to address anyone who is trying to demean my father at this point. Really not great!}
{Milly's. a sad clump of mentally fucken illies. nice lines.}
{FuggnEh whatupdo23}
{Epic music...and best part is of course Eminem. Im always just waiting all song till his appearance. All rest are good.. but he beats everyone. His part brings me goosebumps and heartbeat faster ❤❤❤}
{There’s no competing reality and as long as I’m around ppl who don’t get that we won’t progress.}
{Excited for challenges ahead. Most won’t make it. Way too much of my time wasted placating ppl whose careers wouldn’t exist without me.}
{A number of men are frustrated and doing a sibling rivalry ass movement in my direction or chopper from Stand By Me or like smthg bro like. Uhm as an educated white woman who has yet to be paid for babysitting I’m moving on.}

{Best for them to not count chix b4 they hatch. Waste of my time and needs to be resolved now!}
{Seems relevant that a bunch of men used aspects of my life without my consent and a bunch of ppl treating me like shit relate to those who did that. I have five degrees and have been on my back to placate egos and fantasies that they can get ahead without degrees. Not typically! Not a sibling rivalry. I’ll be moving on and will have an atty someday!}
{Daily reminder about how much of my time is wasted hanging with ppl who think there’s a sibling rivalry. Not safe and not real. Moving on and expect a resolution to a decade of this sad ass approach.}

Cause I'm Adrian Peterson When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid On the track I spank like he just did (DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch Sick of bein' treated like me and shit But Jesus, I can just see why people quit callin' me to do features And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch 180 degrees in here trying to wait for the cedar chips MCs just bit off more than they can Chew like a face full of Swedish Fish Or Lorena with two penises Hateful ingeniousness, this inconvenience And for the record, You won't want this kind of static in Your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it They consider tryna reinsulate yah When it's maybe in for another crazy winter It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde Sick of bein' underdog Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with your relation, changin' it It's still the same and Shady's still a lady killer Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here?

{This is what fuckin classic is 🔥}
{I never thought I will text something like this below the song featuring Eminem, but Danny Brown has best part IMAO}
{Please put a bubble around em, and elon. Two things that will take so much time to replace.   Entities that are so exceptional, beyond the competition, it's clear the pack behind is just that. I'd say the same of others from our past,  but can only dream of what they could have contributed.}
{3:44}
{One day people should study this track in history class 🔥}
{That doesnt make any sense. Eminem verse is better on multiple bullet points, better cadence, better flow, better delivery, better use of vocabulary. Jay z verse was fire and still doesnt match ems verse that was already written way before Jay z even got on the track.}
{best Big sean verse of all time}
{Tout ce touche Eminem est au top ❤}

{3:39}
{First of all, thank you Eminem, your style influenced mine. Secondly, Royce, man did you ever make me think on this track...}
{Still love this tune 🎶 love from Ipswich UK 🇬🇧}
{Accumulate the strategy for eternity to see the times unfold for the bold letters to always show so they know I'm on uppers and downers when I'm on medication when I'm placing my trust in Jesus Christ and god to let me not be jihad so I can let the masses know the truth about the booth when I snoop into  google.i Google my eyes when I stare at the paper for the selection of the article that talks about the partical Atoms swishing in my head until they explode Always pushing me around like I'm nothing at all Until I put you in your place and say a few lines}
{This song hit different when 10th grade was 50 days away}
{Wunder how many loves these guys spewed to do this?}
{🔥🔥🔥}
{Despite any disagreement Brown was Red as fire. Mnm - gold.}
{That big Sean line “we been laboring for years I know it took way longer than 9 months but fuck it it’s all in due time” is just so damn fireeee it gets me every time 🔥🔥🔥🔥}
{this is heat}
{Tell me I can come get it so I can flip the script to make the dip in my pockets sink to the floor like I scuttled a ship in war You wanted the black pearl let me give you the sparrow to fly the mast when I clash on the deck with the crew Mutiny respects me when I come up with an epiphany for no catastrophy when I want to get the trophy for the placement on the blocks when I build them up and get to pulling pieces so I can watch gravity take a hold of me and catch my  catalog The times always respect me they know I'm about that money Tell me I can come get it so I can flip the script to make the dip in my pockets sink to the floor like I scuttled a ship in war You wanted the black pearl let me give you the sparrow to fly the mast when I clash on the deck with the crew Mutiny respects me when I come up with an epiphany for no catastrophy when I want to get the trophy for the placement on the blocks when I build them up and get to pulling pieces so I can watch gravity take a hold of me and catch my  catalog The times always respect me they know I'm about that money}
{Garbage}
{I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with your relation, changin' it It's still the same and Shady's still a lady killer Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center}
{What a shame that spazzy sounding guy is on this track.}
{Big sean verse still on repeat 🔥😮‍💨}
{@Eminem is the best @Eminem is a legend and @Eminem has a talent for rapping, and it would be nice if @Eminem improved talent Sean Michael-Leonard Anderson because he is a young rapper and very talented}

{Am I the only one who hears Proof on this track?? . I'm proud to be from 313 south west all day, from stair to Cahalan 2400,48209.For  once I agree with all the comments I've red here. Detroit , so much talent, but never get there chance. Royce kills it, he is so under rated.  And I'm so proud of eminem staying in michigan after he blew up. I thank God he didnt go live in LA with all the glam. He stayed humble, he stayed true to the state he loved. Yes he is arguably one of the best, if not the best. He proved it in rap God. Like drop the mic, it's over. But everyone did this song justice. And did the city the same. Thank you Detroit for making me the man I am today, thank you for teaching life lessons that I can pass down.}

{Every Person Must Know That .... #1  He Is Lost And Is A Sinner. Romans 3:10 (KJV)  As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: Romans 3:23 (KJV)  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Ecclesiastes 7:20 (KJV)  For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. #2  He Is Under The Wrath Of God Because Of His Sin & That Price Of Sin Is Judgment, Wrath And Hell. Romans 6:23 (KJV)  For the wages of sin is death; ... Revelation 20:14 (KJV)  And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. #3  He Cannot Save Himself  Titus 3:5-6 (KJV)  Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; Ephesians 2:8-9 (KJV)  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:  Not of works, lest any man should boast. #4 Only Jesus Christ Can Save Him Hebrews 2:9 (KJV)  But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. John 14:6 (KJV)  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Acts 4:12 (KJV)  Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. #5  He Is Saved By Faith In Jesus  Acts 16:31 (KJV)  And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. I was gonna end my life 7 years ago heard the Devil tell me I'm not strong enough I should quit. I seen I was a sinner in need of the Saviour and the Lord Jesus Christ saved me. My Saviour is risen. I'm Saved By the blood of the lamb of God Lord Jesus Christ. And He can do the same thing for you. What's it gonna be??? I'm now 7 yrs clean off meth and on the winning side. It's good to be saved. Are you ready? Today is the day of salvation. Your choice will effect the rest of your life and where you spend Eternity.  Revelation 20:14-15 (KJV)  And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. Revelation 21:8 (KJV)  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.}

{Jesus Christ Saves Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time. Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God. EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God: 1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord. 2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead. Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 7. John 3:16 God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.}

{Eminem made everyone sit down}
{I think that enunciation and delivery is a big part of being a great MC.  Voice control, cadence, it all plays into how powerful the lyrics can be if verbally expressed.  You can take the exact same speech of some of the great orators of all time and give the written version of it to someone else and the impact would be completely different? Why?  It’s the voice, the tempo, the delivery, etc.  Just spitting your lyrics, no matter how good it is, becomes damaged goods if the listener can’t hear it without having to constantly hyper-focus or flip the narrative to where they have to make themselves believe that it is an acquired taste.  Hey, that might be partly true but the real truth is that you are not a good rapper.  You are a good writer.  It’s this feature that separates poets from rappers. I think that concept has become lost for some reason. Danny Brown might be a good writer but the way it’s delivered makes it difficult to care about it}
{When Em said 'its like another plane entered into Ukraine', i think of Ukraine and Russian war.. DID HE ALREADY KNEW ABOUT THE WAR COMING?? 🙏 OR THATS MY REACH 😛}

{3:39 Lately it seems as if it's me against the world Like it was before my life became a movie And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with But I flipped that script like AB filler Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script I ain't bein' conceited But I made it to radio, eat a dick I still never ABC the shit Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit And if I ever end up escapin' the Streets I swear that I would stay here Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler Break all of my friends out of here and Take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer Peel off back to the same block that we came from, on a rampage You crazy for me to flip What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid On the track I spank like he just did (DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch Sick of bein' treated like me and shit But Jesus, I can just see why people quit callin' me to do features And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch 180 degrees in here trying to wait for the cedar chips MCs just bit off more than they can Chew like a face full of Swedish Fish Or Lorena with two penises Hateful ingeniousness, this inconvenience And for the record, You won't want this kind of static in Your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it They consider tryna reinsulate yah When it's maybe in for another crazy winter It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde But ain't sick of bein' underdog Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with your relation, changin' it It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here? And if they mention us}

{Eminem 3:39 - 5:18: Lately it seems as if it's me against the world Like it was before my life became a movie And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with But I flipped that script like AB filler Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script I ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio, eat a dick I still never ABC the shit Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage You crazy for me to flip What's makin' you think I need a switch? 'Cause I'm Adrian Peterson When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid On the track I spank like he just did (Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch Sick of bein' treated like me and shit, but Jesus I can just see why people stop callin' me to do features And them cyphers on BET 'cause if I wasn't me I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch, 180 Degrees in here Trying to wait for the cedar chips Mcs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish Or Lorena with two penises Hateful and genius, this inconvenience And for the record, you won't want this kind of static In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it They consider tryna reinsulate yah When it's maybe in for another crazy winter It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde But ain't we sick of bein' underdog Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit may even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with your relation, changin' it it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety center Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated could be danger Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here?

{People hate to hear it but Royce's intro was phenomenal. Danny by far had the best bars and most "feel like you from the d" authenticity on the track... Plus the reason why it's like this, he has the shortest verse and said way more than everybody else that actually feels like Detroit v. Everybody. Em had 3 verses in 1 and still didn't say much..or retract.. he had double the time and verse yet only pulled half of what Royce and like a 3rd of what Danny brought and big Sean did what big Sean do. Told you a story about him and shit. He had the perfect slot on the instrumental. That all said -  Does your city have a song like this?}

{EMINEM - DEAD CHIPHEAD CLONE "he is supposed to be dead, and a permanent clone that needs a new replacement body every 6 months to a year. Unknown if it is even his original consciousness running the clone. Could be a Vrill, could be a dead consciousness recorded on chip. It's why he was slurring his speech and acting mentally handicapped in a few of his interviews, His clone brain was degrading and he needed to get a replacement. They go to specific hospitals, like one near camp David somewhere to get the replacements, they grow multiples and choose the most similar looking one." - Donald Marshall Mar 21, 2013 at 7:20pm RESEARCH DONALD MARSHALL ON HUMAN CLONING AND VRIL LIZARDS!}

I'm just gonna have to chalk it up to Kid's backing of Trump though. God forbid he backs someone other than what the media says to or realizes the left is the reason that city is in a shit hole to begin with.}

{Lately it seems as if it's me against The world, like it was before my life became a movie and they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with But I flipped that script like a refill of Painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script Ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio—eat a dick! I still never ABC this shit Mainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit And if I ever end up escapin' these streets I swear that I would stay here still And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler Break all of my friends out of here And take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer Peel off back to the same block that we came from On a rampage too crazy for me to flip What's makin' you think I need a switch? ‘Cause I'm Adrian Peterson When he's ragin' and heated and On the way to go beat his kid? On a track get spanked like he just did (Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch Sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features and them cyphers on BET, ‘cause if I wasn't me I prob'ly wouldn't Wanna play with me neither, shit Seems to be reachin' its fever pitch Hundred and eighty degrees in here Shoulder blade full of cedar chips MC's just bit off more than they can chew Like a face full of Swedish Fish Or Lorena with two penises Hateful and geniusness inconvenience And for the record, you don't want this type of static In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it May consider tryna reinsulate your windows May be in for another crazy winter ‘Cause so cold in the D, it is As days begin to tick away, but ain't this really What made me into the angry bitter blonde? But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs? Don't make me unleash this shit, release this pit May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with you, but ain't shit changin' It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter With a potato peeler And mushed her face into the entertainment center It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again Or the Bermuda Triangle and Attempted to make a safe descent Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here? And if they mention us…}

Cole] Yeah (For your eyes) For your eyes only (For your eyes) For your eyes only, for your eyes only (For your eyes, for your eyes) For your eyes only [Verse 1: J. Cole] Hey, niggas be dying on the daily It seems my dreams faded for far too long The consequences deadly Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal 'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet Like I ain't out in the field like that I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless Screaming, "Fuck the law," my life is lawless That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets But these felonies be making life the hardest Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it That's why I write this sonnet If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it (For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it (For your eyes) For your eyes only [Hook: J. Cole] For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes, do you understand me? For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes, do you understand me? For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes, do you understand me? For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes only [Verse 2: J. Cole] You probably grown now so this song'll hit you If you hearing this, unfortunately means That I'm no longer with you in the physical Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive He got me praying that the spiritual is real So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too So I know how part of you feels Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots And fiends that smoke rocks I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance Don't know if I ever had a chance At a glance, I'm a failure Addicted to pushing paraphernalia But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging Blood was staining the concrete Older niggas I loved talked like they was above Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money Picked up the family business by the age of 13 Six years later was handed sentence 'Round the same time is when you came in this world Me and your mama thinking: "What the fuck we naming this girl?" I told her "Nina," the prettiest name that I could think of For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19 Took me two felonies to see the trap This crooked-ass system set for me And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be The one that set examples that was never set for me I'm living fast, but not fast enough 'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me And if my past becomes the death of me I hope you understand [Hook: J. Cole] For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes, do you understand me? For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes, do you understand me? For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes, do you understand me? For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes only [Verse 3: J. Cole] It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout? Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated 'Cause the cash running out? Niggas don't know how to act in a drought See, baby girl, I realized My definition of a real nigga was skewed My views misshaped by new mixtapes That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops And the cyclical nature of doing time continues My worst fear is one day that you come home from school And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true But maybe there's a chance that it's not And this album remains locked In a hard drive like valuable jewels And I can teach you this in person Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you For your eyes only [Hook: CharGaux & J. Cole] For your eyes, for your eyes only For your eyes, for your eyes only For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes only [Verse 4: J. Cole] One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice And it was chilling, he said: "Jermaine, I knew you since we was children I never asked for nothing, when times was hard I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me I dealt with the repercussions of my actions I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit But that shit was in my blood, you know my life I know your momma, nigga, send my love In case I never get a chance to speak again I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib That's the way I wished my family lived But my granny crib was in the 'jects" I had to interject like: "Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?" He said, "Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions But I been having premonitions Just call it visions from the other side I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow Like the time I'm living on is borrowed With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father Write my story down, and if I pass Go play it for my daughter when she ready" And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son I dedicate these words to you and all the other children Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation That sent your pops to prison when he needed education Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better Although I know that means that I would never Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold Not because he was the first To get some pussy 12 years old Not because he used to come through In the Caddy on some vogues Not because he went from bagging up Them grams to serving O's Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars Not because he screamed, "Fuck the law" Although that was true Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you For your eyes only   Produced By Elite, BLVK., J.

{I remember playing this song on loop while playing GTA Vice City lol.  Royce is always lyrical with his verse. Big Sean verse was actually real good with deep metaphors. EM OWNED it like always. EMz verse is so long but such a beautiful flow that you get lost in it as if you're inside Detroit at that moment}
{4:01 I was daydreamin' one day I would be the sh*t, And if I ever end up escapin' the streets, I swear that I would stay here, still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real, Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler, break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer,}

{Wow Em. Good thing his verse is last or ain't nobody listen to the rest of the song lol. Not trying to throw shade on Sean or Royce cause they did well too}
{people don't get how savage it is to have Trick Trick in a video !}
{Danny brown be spitting man. Hands down, if you say you can't understand him it's because you aren't listening. 🤷🏽}
{Big sean got the best verse who agree}
{It's funny. When I first watched this I pretty much only clicked on it because Eminem. Literally didn't know any of these other artists. Now every last one that had a verse are in my top rappers. This is one of the most legendary posse tracks ever made. Every one of these rappers are top tier and Eminem rivalling. If you were like me just checking out this for Eminem, look at the rest of these rappers projects. Some are even better than some of Eminem's work. Legendary.}

{Sports in Detroit: Lions: Never won a Superbowl, probably wont until they relocate to Portland Tigers: Storied franchise that just cant win. Hasn't won a world series since the 80's Pistons: Wait what???? They actually made the playoffs last year just to get swept by the bucks lol. Bad team. Bad franchise. Go back to fort wayne. Red Wings:  2015: We're a good team, 24 straight playoff streak. 2016: We're a good team, 25 straight playoff streak. 2017: Oh no, we didn't make the playoffs! what are we going to do???. 2018: Red wings sucking it up again??? Unheard of since the 70's and 80's. 2019: 2nd Last in the league. this team sucks. Just relocate to houston already. 2020: OK BOOMER wake up its time to relocate and go to houston after this horrible season.}

Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years I know it took way longer than 9 months, but fuck it, it's all in due time I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though Don't want to, I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful This is just part 1, wait 'til the sequel Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (Statik) I swear I love my city, I just want a little (Statik) See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (Statik) Detroit vs. Everybody Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat Just a step away from felon, that's why they call it the D On your bleeder, ho, reason for all of this honesty Honestly no honor roll, but honor the Phantom stripper pole 'Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas say Put a sack on your head, you bleed out like the reverend And to think our hood harder then I might break the door Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Molly In a blink I'll hit your kisser, bet you ass ain't rememberin' They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman I kings bout that scuba but I ain't get to no betterin' Cough up a line, 313 where I'm from Zan got me cross eyed like Bernstein's son And these niggas try to copy but I hold on this time It's us vs them, Detroit vs Everybody yeah Lately it seems as if it's me against the world Like it was before my life became a movie And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with But I flipped that script like AB filler Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script I ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio, eat a dick I still never ABC the shit Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage You crazy for me to flip What's makin' you think I need a switch? 'Cause I'm Adrian Peterson When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid On the track I spank like he just did (Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch Sick of bein' treated like me and shit, but Jesus I can just see why people stop callin' me to do features And them cyphers on BET 'cause if I wasn't me I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch, 180 Degrees in here Trying to wait for the cedar chips Mcs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish Or Lorena with two penises Hateful and genius, this inconvenience And for the record, you won't want this kind of static In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it They consider tryna reinsulate yah When it's maybe in for another crazy winter It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde But ain't we sick of bein' underdog Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit may even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with your relation, changin' it it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety center Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated could be danger Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here?

{Lately it seems as if it's me against the world Like it was before my life became a movie And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with But I flipped that script like AB filler Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script I ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio, eat a dick I still never ABC the shit Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage You crazy for me to flip What's makin' you think I need a switch? 'Cause I'm Adrian Peterson When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid On the track I spank like he just did (Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch Sick of bein' treated like me and shit, but Jesus I can just see why people stop callin' me to do features And them cyphers on BET 'cause if I wasn't me I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch, 180 Degrees in here Trying to wait for the cedar chips Mcs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish Or Lorena with two penises Hateful and genius, this inconvenience And for the record, you won't want this kind of static In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it They consider tryna reinsulate yah When it's maybe in for another crazy winter It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde But ain't we sick of bein' underdog Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit may even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with your relation, changin' it it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety center Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated could be danger Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here? And if they mention us}

{Speaking as the only white boy coming up around my black friends, lemme share some advice: If you find yourself in a part of the city where the buildings have no windows you can see thru and you see some boys making their way and there's one white kid with them, eyes big, sees everything, use caution.  He's got a back up piece for his back up piece and his finger stays on that trigger. Side note: the scene with Sean where you see 5 dudes lined up in the dark of the buildings gave me chills.  That's the last thing some poor mothafuckers see and that's real.}

{Maaan if you've never been to Detroit you won't understand.. that city is unique and I've been to a lot of citys.. there's history everywhere you look.. beautiful rubble.. it tells a story.. I've never been anywhere in my life that sticks in my mind like Detroit.. and I've been to 3rd world country projects.. Detroit got weird energy.. unexplainable.. but if you've been you'll understand. I believe it's cursed land. I caught 3 felonies on that trip. I was in the projects.. hit 8 mile because i was an em fan.. understood his line to icp "you aint seen  a fuckin mile road south of 10" it clicked because when you head north the mile roads go up and the environment fades from gritty to safer. Like i said I'm not from Detroit but i felt and experienced it.. unfortunately i ended up in prison for five years from that trip.. probably the reason Detroit stick in my mind because i was on some wild shit back then. Also all of these drug references in a few Detroit artists makes sense to the landscape of Detroit. A beautiful yet depressing city full of energy good and bad}

{Verse 4: Eminem] Lately it seems as if it's me against The world, like it was before my life became a movie and they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with But I flipped that script like a refill of Painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script Ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio—eat a dick! I still never ABC this shit Mainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit And if I ever end up escapin' these streets I swear that I would stay here still And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler Break all of my friends out of here And take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer Peel off back to the same block that we came from On a rampage too crazy for me to flip What's makin' you think I need a switch? ‘Cause I'm Adrian Peterson When he's ragin' and heated and On the way to go beat his kid? On a track get spanked like he just did (Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch Sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features and them cyphers on BET, ‘cause if I wasn't me I probably wouldn't Want to play with me neither, shit Seems to be reachin' its fever pitch Hundred and eighty degrees in here Shoulder blade full of cedar chips MC's just bit off more than they can chew Like a face full of Swedish Fish Or Lorena with two penises Hateful and geniusness inconvenience And for the record, you don't want this type of static In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it May consider tryin' to reinsulate your windows May be in for another crazy winter ‘Cause so cold in the D, it is As days begin to tick away, but ain't this really What made me into the angry bitter blonde? But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs? Don't make me unleash this shit, release this pit May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with you, but ain't shit changin' It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter With a potato peeler And mushed her face into the entertainment center It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again Or the Bermuda Triangle and Attempted to make a safe descent Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here?

{A lesser known fact : Royce was first offered a record deal by Dre, but he turned it down. Few years ago, Royce revealed it to be his biggest regret! Remember, everything Dre touches turns into gold (Eazy, Snoop, Tupac, Eminem, 50, Kendrick). Regardless, Royce is dope af, I can only imagine how great he would have been if his albums were produced by Dre too.  Thanks for reading, Have a good Day :)}

{Songs about Detroit are not the same as before. It is maybe because of the time that flies by and nothing is the same. Everything changes and after the riot in Detroit, it is pointless to rap about it. Detroit is gone. It has less population than everyone else. Yall can change my mind of course, or at least try. The song is good though. And even if the whole new gangsta rap started in Detroit, it seems it goes down like Detroit.}

{Listen to me. I can write a comeback for every rapper in that song except Eminem. Next in line would be Big Sean. I am impressed by that young man for real. I was skeptical when I heard him rapping on Ariana Grande stuff but I Respect his lyrical prowess now. Eminem is easily the Einstein of rap at this point in life in my humble opinion. The only 3 rappers I feel did well in a song with Eminem as far as lyrical content are Trick Trick, Royce da 5'9 and T.I. That is just what I have heard though. If there is someone better I seriously sincerely beg of you to educate and I WILL respond. I have written my own rhymes for over 15 years now many of which have been quoted by famous artists which lets me know I have been on the right track. With Eminem's evolution, I dare say that he has surpassed Pac unfortunately. His song "Good Guy" is completely flawless... even if people were dumb enough to consider him an "idiot savant." I declare that 3 decades would likely pass before his equal or better could arrive at a minimum to challenge him as a lyricist or songwriter; myself included, which isn't saying much. The closest brilliant light of lyrical content would be either Nas or Logic and Logic is still raw at this point from what I can comprehend.}

I still never ABC this shit Mainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit And if I ever end up escapin' these streets I swear that I would stay here still And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler Break all of my friends out of here And take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer Peel off back to the same block that we came from On a rampage too crazy for me to flip What's makin' you think I need a switch? ‘Cause I'm Adrian Peterson When he's ragin' and heated and On the way to go beat his kid?

But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs? Don't make me unleash this shit, release this pit May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with you, but ain't shit changin' It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter With a potato peeler And mushed her face into the entertainment center It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again Or the Bermuda Triangle and Attempted to make a safe descent Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here?

{Em, when you coming home, for our concert????}
{Fkn dude's deadly}
{Eminem vs world}
{Big Sean went absolutely nuts on this shit.  With a beat like this on a song called "Detroit" with Eminem in the studio next to you when you're born and raised in Detroit you KNOW you're playing your A+ game! That's like someone from Brooklyn who grew up listening to Jay Z going half-assed on a track. You'll NEVER be on a song with any of the greats again.  Big Sean deserves hella credit for this!}
{Eminem uses an internal rhyme pattern where the rhyming words and syllables don't have to be in rhythm with each other. Along with an incredible ability to twist words and enunciations to make things which don't technically rhyme sound like they do rhyme.  Basically they don't technically rhyme but it rhymes within the song to the human ear. I've heard/read him explaining this several interviews.  With the weird ass, empty and juvenile shit he's made he isn't the most consistent rapper. But his absolutely amazing talent and the greatness of his quality music is undeniable. When Eminem is focused and motivated he's one of the greatest song writers in history. When his not focused and motivated he's like Fred Durst with more talent and better marketing.  There's no other artist who's catalogue I have more of a love - hate relationship with than Eminem's. His good stuff absolutely untouchable. His bad stuff is absolute trash. But his legacy was safe and secure well over a decade ago.}

{Brutally genius!!}
{I bust up love custom. My trust runs up some drums.  Music moves this clueless. Ruthless units boosted moodless. Reyes slay they face grey. Heavens Gates save pain. Lessons paint change hate raised. Woman I save delay angels when man turns fatal when she stakes a page. They rage love I maintain. I am crazy so when woman save me from a gun that place these ammunition that face me daily.  Saline in my brain clinged lately. So dehydrated, woman can't save me. I work so hard I was in the hospital exhausted. My love burned so far logical polished. My rhymes so unstoppable. Thy crime flow unlocked zones. I took five rappers down. My hook strike chapters frown. Man on the battlefield also affected champions around. Woman rocks us laughable still. Hollow tons reckless slams yin loud. That's a punchline a legend in opinion. Rap they sunshine race weapons pin oblivion. I am sorry rappers don't learn. My facts hardly sadder folks serve. Love is hard in every verse. Guns pinch scars when cleverly surge. The power of a lightning first was energy for mans work. Music is the essance of the world. One woman could make a man a pearl. We curl in defense. The human effect will leave people in a deep wreck. We think best when trying to solve problems. We inhale and exhale from all lungs. People are awesome intill face with shotguns. The enemies try to box us. I was fighting for my life for female. Love is a deep sail. Man thinks, will love prevail?  People email. Networking business is like jail. Our system only wants us to fail so men don't have tales. Loves only wants mail. People never appreciated a message untill they are without people senseless. Is love effective when your alone without presence of human affection? I am a loner I admit it. I used to fake love in mad distance. This is my jam inscripted. The world flashes missions. Find your love, my glove grips our image woman think of. We fly above.  My songs fall apart when people depart. I walk across stars as this picture feels large. Love is a trap of steel bars. Best be warned love is a force when woman close the doors. Wars caused by drama people can't afford.  People can't reach my bars. I will invisible light into dark. I was a angel from the start. People use cars. I rather be homeless because woman be to hard to judge a man when he lose focus. They won't let us get our education. This country is faker than satan. People need changes. Rich people are money hungry animals driven by patience that lead people into annihilation. I want to die keep my lyrics. People try to take my spirit. My heart pierces. People are only fearless when they see my mirror flip. I hope my music is the definition of love when you hear it. The atmosphere switch when I disappear quick. You best keep your clearance. Dear Him, love is a battlefield, beard this. Cheer bliss, I switch gears quick. Why do people fear him?     Love is tearless intill death when the peoples hearts pierces. Death bring a new alignment. Is true love really priceless? People ask the wisest who is the nicest. True love kept in private. I minus hate from violence. I hope you let the mind widen.}
{We need the sequel with Eminem, Royce, Big Sean and some newer lyricist from Detroit. Come Em let's get it.}
{I can listen to this track forever. Heard it when it first came out and still listening to it. Big Sean went crazy on this. In this order Eminem, Big Sean and then Royce. Royce is one of my favorite rappers after Eminem. Tupac is first then Eminem and Royce in that order.}

{Anyone else skip the Big Sean verse when this song plays? He may have good lyrics in this song, but the dude doesn't come close to the technical skills of Royce, Brown, or Eminem, and I feel he single handedly held the song back. Song would've been much better with literally any other Detroit rapper. Even shitty ass Bizarre from D12 would've probably done this song more justice, lol.}

{Em always snapping I swear, Big Sean snapped too}
{This song...This song is just something else. I always get insane chills listening to it, am i the only one that gets that? Eminem's music is truly incredible. I love how he's a 100% honest and how he spilled his heart out writing this song. It's really inspiring. Eminem inspired almost every kid from my generation to get off their asses and do something. He inspired me to get up and chase my dream which is rap. I'm an 20 year old rapper and I think you'd enjoy the music on my channel. My most honest song is called “Suicide Note", I spilled my heart out writing and recording it. Check it out if you get the chance to, I promise you won't be disappointed! P.s..There's no need to hate because I'm advertising, I'm just chasing my dream!}
{This song is so FREAKING good in every element of it that daaaamn.. No, I have no words for it really. 🔥🔥🔥}
{Nobody commenting on here would know they head from they ass. Detroit got way better rappers that woulda really ate on this track. But first of all, quit letting Em pick the beats, that's trash. Also, no continuity. Sound like they all wrote they verses on a 3am from Vegas to the D. And what's the singer doing? She didn't even write that lil bit of nothing. Guaranteed someone wrote her a line, bam, she prolly sang it once, doubled it, and they punched it in every other time. Doesn't even work with the song. If i was from Detroit, i'd be like fuvk no this ain't the anthem to my city, no fuvkin way. Not complete trash, but nobody hungry, and nobody stayed over night in the studeo working it into a polished diamond. But i bet they all took a cut from the up front money. Lazy track... a cities anthem should be memorable! Plus Em is a washed up racist or did all yall forget that when you was cashing ur checks? Jesus fuvkn christ... get it together. And big Sean makes pop, and K. Dot ate his ass up...i don't smoke cravk mufuvka i sell it! What's worse, Em being a racist or all these niggas falling out when the preacher starts speaking in tongues, crowning Remi the greatest rapper ever!?lmao how? Mgk ate him up and i'm pretty sure Em wear just a touch of makeup in his interview about it. Look close... or is niggas really this weak now? "Omg mgk, you just ended your career" sound gay af when actually mgk the only reason anybody said the name shady in 10 years. Fame make real niggas sleepy. Dafuq?}

{Who still waiting for the sequel??}
{Em is the goat, that's not an opinion , that's a fact. Compare the sells of his songs/albums to any other hip hop artists. I mean people can say what they want, they have the rights to, but at the end of the day. it comes down to facts and number. Like a lot of people like to say "America is the greatest country in the world", there isn't even an oz of evidence to support that. The only few things we're number 1 at is how many people believe in Christianity and how many people are in jail/prison.  greatest country my ass, this man spent 29 years in prison for a crime he never committed and all the charges are still on his record even though there are evidence to prove he was completely innocence, and the fact he's not mad or have any resentment towards them is just completely mind blowing. He is a better man than I, cause I would had definitely lost it. It ain't no coincident that there are more minorities jailed/prison than the great "race" of "whites". Race is just an IDEA made to separate one from an other, just because someone looks different DOES NOT mean they aren't a HUMAN or should have different treatment. As a minority myself, I have personally experience this kind of unfair treatment. "Someone" called the cops on me, saying I am trying to steal MY OWN CAR. Just imagine if we all came together as one, there wouldn't be anything we can't do, not even the government can do a damn thing against a country of UNITED people.}

They exist, and even if you don't believe in them, they believe in you, and they are waiting you in your afterlife! Don't follow this rappers blindly. If it's your choice to follow them, you can, but know that what they want the most is to live their lifes and carry a lot of young  rap fans to HELL with them. : They already sold their souls, for them there's no turning back. But for you, you can still turn back to JESUS and GOD, and look for the salvation. Don't follow this idols blindly. They don't want you to know what's real gong on behind the scenes. Know what they are talking about.  If still knowing that they are baphomet whorshipers, you want to follow them: OK! you have your free will, but don't get it twisted when you go to hell!}

I was stoked when I heard about the Cee-Lo feature, but then I saw the video... Damn. Not what I was hoping it would be... But, this track... that's a different story. I can't believe I missed this one when it dropped. (Update: Just listened to a few more Slaughterhouse tracks and those tracks were actually pretty solid)}

{As a musician and 30 yr old fan that remembers back when pac got shot.... Every artist on this track displays what rap used to be about. I'm glad its coming back. I can't swallow anymore of the mumble rap trash. Em and royce have always been magic together}
{No one. Will.Ever. Will. Be. Better. Than. Eminem. Ever.}
{Don't listen to this song a lot but when I do  Damn!!! All my neighbourhood complain about the song beign too good for this "World"}
{Who came here after Eminem interview ?}

{[Verse 4: Eminem] Lately it seems as if it's me against The world, like it was before my life became a movie and they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with But I flipped that script like a refill of Painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script Ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio—eat a dick! I still never ABC this shit Mainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit And if I ever end up escapin' these streets I swear that I would stay here still And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler Break all of my friends out of here And take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer Peel off back to the same block that we came from On a rampage too crazy for me to flip What's makin' you think I need a switch? ‘Cause I'm Adrian Peterson When he's ragin' and heated and On the way to go beat his kid? On a track get spanked like he just did (Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch Sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features and them cyphers on BET, ‘cause if I wasn't me I probably wouldn't Want to play with me neither, shit Seems to be reachin' its fever pitch One hundred and eighty degrees in here Shoulder blade full of cedar chips MC's just bit off more than they can chew Like a face full of Swedish Fish Or Lorena with two penises Hateful and geniusness inconvenience And for the record, you don't want this type of static In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it May consider tryin' to reinsulate your windows May be in for another crazy winter ‘Cause so cold in the D, it is As days begin to tick away, but ain't this really What made me into the angry bitter blonde? But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs? Don't make me unleash this shit, release this pit May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with you, but ain't shit changin' It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter With a potato peeler And mushed her face into the entertainment center It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again Or the Bermuda Triangle and Attempted to make a safe descent Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here? And if they mention us…}
{I can't believe Em invated DeJ on his song. She totally fucked that up. He is dissing mumble rap and she is really close to being mumble rapper with her autotune overuse.}

{Em you the man but big Sean wins this}
{This is so underrated}
{Royce da 5'9 is still the FUCKING SHIT}
{1. Royce 2. Danny 3. Em 4. Big Sean}
{I like it.  It kinda sounds like Em is ready to hang it up.  In any event, he's accomplished all there is to gain out of the rap game.  It sucks when you come out with one style, or persona, and everyone expects that from you in every song.  Sorry to tell you sheep, but that's not creativity.  If you don't write, or just a consumer of hip hop, and never tried to write your own 16, don't say shit about someone who mastered it regardless on how you feel about the song.}
{Today only one rapper is here.... All others are girls... E}
{Who's that annoying bitch at the beginning?}
{Anyone else get goosebumps when em comes in with his verse?}
{Danny Brown the GOAT}
{Real hip hop ..}
{This is something I can't do alone...I'm asking everyone that's watching this video that they could please like and and comment on my new single. Support the movement because all support is greatly appreciated!!! Even if it may not be your cup of tea I guarantee I will have something that will be. Vin Chilz - Mind Control   Thanking You in Advance}

{It ain't easy to get back up after hitting rock bottom but Eminem really made it.. His growth as an artist is truly inspiring to witness. They don't make deeply personal music like this no more. Check out my "Mockingbird" freestyle! I hope i did the original justice. Peace & love}

{If Eminem were black there would be no argument that he’s the best ever.  Since he’s white black people will say Tupac even though they know themselves it’s not true.  I like Tupac, but quit saying Tupac is the best just because it’s a black dominant area of music.  I’m sorry, but a white person has killed you all at your own game.  Just accept it.  You still have basketball.}

Nothing overly special, especially not for Royce}

{hands down Sean Don has the best verse 🔥🔥 😲 his bars were out of this world ....my favorite part is the end #LilBitch}
{Get it}
{For me Royce was the best not necessarily because of the lyrics i mean they were fine but his voice matches this perfectly. Love em he also killed it but something i di t like is whenever he does songs with other rappers he always gets the longest but for example shadyxv when they all rapped wothout music the cideo was 19 mins and em took 9 mins and all the rest took 10 mins}
{Круто Its Cool}
{Toujours aussi vulgaire et hardcor. Eminem t'es le meilleur.}
{eminem part is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥}
{this song makes me feel happy because marshal always makes me happy whenever i listen to his rap, and he is the most successful rapper in history}
{Why isn't  Elzhi on this song he is the best to ever come out of Detroit next to Em}

{Thumbs👍 If You Got GooseBumps On Eminem Verse.....}
{Oh Man Big Sean What Had Happened 2 You......}
{When is the next Cypher?}
{🖒👍 for Detroit}
{Eminem has gotten so fucking weak over the years. he has more ability but only tries to make everything sound crazy fast by making the quick parts spit with a short breath style.... no hate at all to eminem at all the dude is amazing but stop with this gibberish bullshit. spit a line that can be understood and appreciated. you used to have a point except telling us how much better you are then everyone else. and dude you STILL think the whole world is against you......wtf dude. your eminem let it go dude. you won.  you beat the game but please drop the Busta Rhyme quick spit style. Rap god sounded like shit even though everyone kissed your ass for it. it was trash. you can do better. also luv you dawg your a master.... just some harsh love from a fan that wants to see you return to glory.}
{This has to be your sickest verse ever. or at least the one that relates to me the most.  We all had personal challenges, but when I hear him on this, I feel like snapping but keeping my human nature at the same time, that eighteen wheeler shit was for real man, I want to do the same thing, I feel and sense pain all over everyone and Slim is like a channel of that, or maybe Im just empathizing with dope shiiiiiittt!}
{eminem is loooooooooooooooovvvvee!!....i know he dznt give a fuck......its all fine as long as he keeps on making such awesome verses}
{this song is pure rap of life!!so fckin glittering shits,boucing tits...and em is fckin huge as always}

{dannys voice is cool}
{I want a west coast vs everybody}
{Foreal its survival of the fittest in Michigan period}
{they say my city tough..like 2 fast bitches scissorring lol dead 😂}
{"I probably wouldn;t want to play with me either" - Em}
{Big Sean spit a great verse but Eminem just takes it to a new level.  I am waiting for him to fall off but his composition is on another level.  I have to rewind Eminem verses in order to catch every line and its meaning.  He is still on top of this rap game...Unbelievable....}
{Sick song}
{OK!}
{FIREEEEE MEN!!!!}
{sorry but Em really killed it}
{where's esham at}
{Its true what they say about Detroit. We have some delipidated neighborhoods and crime has always been an issue for so long. But maaaaaaaan our talent here is endless! Detroit stand up!!}
{DETROIT MADE EMINEM AND CHRYSLER GROUP I LOVE DETROITTTTTTTTTT SO BADDD}
{people out here hatin on EM because their favorite rapper has never been in the guinness world record, because their favorite rapper never sold 100M records worldwide, because their favorite rapper never won 15 grammys, because their favorite rapper never won an oscar, because their favorite rapper respects and probably is afraid to face EMINEM, because their favorite rapper probably has a ghost writer, and their favorite rapper broke af and still trying to flex but EMINEM has more money than most of all these other rappers with the networth of $190M USD and he is still humble, and most importantly their favorite rapper can't spit cyphers like EMINEM, EMINEM is the type of guy that would murder you in your own song, like if EMINEM was featured in a song that song is not yours anymore, notice how every time EMINEM comes out with something new, it always blows up, notice how his old songs are never called old, they are called a classic, his old songs never get old. EMINEM is called "a sleeping giant" because every time he rests, he wakes up with heat.}
{2017}
{Eminem is a BEAST!!!!!!!!}

{People sleep on Big Sean🔥}
{Bankhead by T.I. listen to it... Em dropped one of the nastiest tracks topping T.I. Tip did bring all of his dudes to rep their city, but Em beat him... Bankhead - T.I.}

{Sean Don Boy, I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety 100 percent cut; no stitches required Welcome to Detroit, where if you get that promotion Don't worry, man, them bullets will still be at your ass firin' I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin' Boy, I hit the beat, I just treat that shit like a diary I'm offended if you hear my new shit And you ain't rewindin' me Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect My homie wanted a Chevy, so I put my dog in the 'Vette Ahh! Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch If the ball in my hand, then the ball in the net Bitch, I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me I'm overrespected My mama gated community's overprotective So futuristic I'm already over my next bitch Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away Tryna get paid fifty ways a day Used to put fifty on the layaway Now my closet fifty shades of grey 26, and I done lived a lifetime a few times From futons to Grey Poupons In church tryna get a little savings; yeah, a coupon I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines Takin' down my number, like, "You still ain't got a new line?" Nah, it's the same, we been laborin' for years I know it took way longer than nine months But fuck it, it's all in due time I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle Don't want to, I need to, ya gotta learn to keep it cerebral When you come up in a place Where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel, lil' bitch!}

{Detroit, not OK!}
{rei do rap}
{I like detroit}
{i feel like eminem bumped up tge awesomeness factor by about 1,000,000%}
{Maybe it's 'coz i came from listening most of Danny Brown's shit, but this - especially the fucking hook (omg how bad it is) and Big Sean's verse - is just so lackluster i couldn't even like it for a moment. It doesn't even help that Em, 5'9", and Danny are right now are in my top favorites.}
{Se louco só os Reis}
{i just want to know why this shit didn't get a big hit. i mean 37M is still not good enough, meanwhile gangnam style shit got 2B views.. why? the main reason is VEVO and youtube they killed the real hip-hop man}

{Once again, Eminem killed it! The best verse in the whole song!}
{navy seal of bravery wow}
{The reason why Danny is being hated on is not because of his bars (they were actually amazing) but because he ruined the whole style of the track. He just sounds so out of place and it just doesn't fit in with the style of this.}
{Royce,Em and big Sean killed it}
{is it me or after eminem did everyone else kind of sound slower}

{Everybody on this song went in on the beat. Royce, Sean, Danny, And Em all went above and beyond. Dej reppin on the hook. Trick is a boss, so he didn't have to rap. Although, he would've murdered this.}

{Eminem will be 50 and still school 20 year old wannabe rappers.}
{Mad Love and Respect for not selling out.... Please be the guide for true hip hop artists needing that path because some of us didn't get to live our dreams due to d'evils and no real support... I still write however i gave birth to a lyrical positive influence... MaShaAllah  peace and love}

{Danny brown has an awesome voice👌}
{superstar eminem to the king rap god}
{only came for danny}
{This true hip hop does not exist anymore unfortunately}
{BIG SEAN sounded like he put a lot of extra detail in that verse. Yeah, he had different flows & good punchlines, but the most interesting part was the amount of attention he gave towards every syllable that left his mouth. He had one flow.... his voice pitch changed from low to high every syllable. EMINEM... at this point, I have to stop trying to understanding what the fuck is wrong with his mind. He's so good at matching syllables that he might be in the middle of 4 different rhyme schemes with one bar. My brain hurts trying to identify what kind of patterns he was rhyming in.  I'm pretty sure his bars were structured to rhyme with "Lately it seems as if". He went from that, to switching into this rapid / intense flow, to switching back his flow back to rhyme something with "Lately it seems as if". Than, he went back to flowing rapid and intense again, and than went back to rhyme "lately it seems as if" with something else. Some fucking how, Eminem is able to rap as many bars as he wants between the bars that are part of his main rhyme pattern ROYCE... Every bar he spit, his pitch got higher at the end. If he was rapping just a little bit slower I would've thought he was singing. Sometimes I want to ask Royce "do you know what song you're on rn?"}

{African-Americans hate Eminem because he's White.  If Eminem was black he would be praised everywhere and by everyone.  People claim that Eminem is famous because he's White...  Ya'll say that Tupac would never create a track/Album with Eminem because he's White, how would you know that?  Eminem has reached the top, he's 44 right now and still making music and still getting hate.  #GiveRespect}

{This format of comment may be overused but I don't give a fuck. People hate eminem because of his fans, not him. He is a great rapper who writes amazing lyrics. People need to understand that. Separate the artist from the fans. Eminem didn't ask for dickriders, but he got them. Not his fault. Don't complain, just appreciate the artist and try to block out haters and annoying fans. That's all I have to say.}

{People who hate the older Eminem really just don't like him being smart and making better decisions. Em isn't falling off at all. He's still in the mainstream and he's getting better at maintaining mainstream recognition while also being very lyrical. He used to be a scholar who would explain fucked up shit in his life, now he's an evolved scholar who explains fucked up shit in hip-hop and in the world and he is more skilled as an Mc and more aware of what it means to be an MC. You would rather Eminem sell out and do dumbed down songs about drugs? REALLLLLY?????????????}

Nas's NY State of Mind was a dope song, but it wasn't an anthem.}

{1) Eminem 2)Big Sean 3)Royce 4)Danny my opinion is based on this one song, not their overall ability. In my opinion, Royce is a million times better than Sean and Danny, but Sean was just better in this song. Danny was dope, but it placing them was hard. Eminem is Thee G.O.A.T}
{real shit big sean looks like tyrone biggums-Dave Chappelle}
{Let's be honest this song will never be someones favorite song !}
{Besides the outro, did anyone else hear Trick Trick in the background during the hook and whenever they were like "DETROIT vs. EVERYBODY"}
{Anybody noticed the hotdogs when em mention with 2 penises 😂}
{I like Eminem he's awesome!}
{damn Danny Brown looks exactly like he sounds.}
{awesome song boi lit}
{I only came to the song to here Eminem}
{They should put big Sean out of the song and kid Rock in.}
{Em looks so fluffy and huggable 😂😍}
{cade os br}
{I came here as an eminem fan. however he is at best my third favourite in the song. big sean kills it.}
{The city of Detroit or even the state of Michigan and Rodney Dangerfield have one thing going for them. No fucking RESPECT}
{This is my new favorite song}
{1. em 2. sean don 3. royce  4. danny}
{This song...This song is just something else. I always get insane chills listening to it, am i the only one that gets that? Eminem's music is truly incredible. I love how he's a 100% honest and how he spilled his heart out writing this song. It's really inspiring. Eminem inspired almost every kid from my generation to get off their asses and do something. He inspired me to get up and chase my dream which is rap. I'm an 20 year old rapper and I think you'd enjoy the music on my channel. My most honest song is called “Suicide Note", I spilled my heart out writing and recording it. Check it out if you get the chance to, I promise you won't be disappointed! P.s..There's no need to hate because I'm advertising, I'm just chasing my dream!}
{big sean killed this one he was the better rapper on this then Royce}
{big sean kills it}
{*Lyrics* Mom I know I let you down And though you say the days are happy Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up? And mom, I know he's not around But don't you place the blame on me As you pour yourself another drink and I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on Maybe we took this too far I went in headfirst Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse My mom probably got it the worst The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are Did I take it too far? Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs But regardless I don't hate you 'cause ma! You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam Desert Storm and both of us put together Can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare And forever we can drag this on and on But, agree to disagree That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me You're kicking me out? It's fifteen degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave) Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats Why we always at each others throats? Especially when dad, he fucked us both We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope) Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old, and That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far 'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though 'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth But I'm sorry mama for 'Cleaning Out My Closet', at the time I was angry Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio And I think of Nathan being placed in a home And all the medicine you fed us And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, 'cause One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them And although one has met their grandma Once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and I saw your headlights as I looked back And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet I guess I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar 'Cause you're my mama I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far I want a new life One without a cause So I'm coming home tonight Well no matter what the cost And if the plane goes down Or if the crew can't wake me up Just know that I was alright And I was not afraid to die Oh even if there's songs to sing My children will carry me Just know that I'm alright I was not afraid to die Because I put my faith in my new girl So I never say goodbye cruel world Just know that I'm alright I am not afraid to die I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far, I want a new life}

{LOL @ all these haters. I mean it's your right to have your opinion on these artists but you got no right to diss city of Detroit if you are NOT from The D or even worse, if you have never been here. Most of you have your thoughts based on media reports made by the folks who don't even know where is Detroit. But I'll tell you this. Diss as much as you want but we will still make a full recovery despite all the bad s**t. Now go and "enjoy" your lives in your gated communities while we're actually enjoying ours in our beautiful city which is becoming more and more beautiful every day. The D will be on the top once again & then we're so gonna F your asses up! It's really us vs them. #DetroitVsEverybody}

{I like Royce's style better than Eminem's newer one of very  fast, compact, Rhymes.  He's saying a lot, without saying anything, as Dre said on "The Chronic".  Royce is probably the most talented mainstream rapper (writer). Eminem has grown up &  his writing reflects that (I  get that). The underground is ruled by The Demigodz, ILL BiLL (Heavy Metal Kings), & Vinny Paz.}

{The guy at 3:20 sounds like MC Vagina in the WTF collective lol.}
{Eminem had the most complex verse,but his choppy flow sounds a bit annoying at times.Big Sean had great lyrics but his delivery sucks.Royce had a sick flow and great lyrics.That other guy is barely understandable but his verse was dope}

{Eminem is best rapper alive hands down fuck the HATERS}
{3:02 made me laugh so hard!}
{am I the only one that doesnt like Dej Loaf? I know she from the D but dont like her, think she sounds annoying on the hook. I felt like the hook could have been something more tough... maybe Trick Trick could have did the hook}
{Royce is underrated his flow is nice}
{love ya em. got mad respect for the D but I'm from the town aka oakland, y'all don't want to be from here. your city looks more ghetto because of your abandoned manufacturing buildings but niggas where I'm from will literally destroy your whole blood line, past, present and future because you looked at them funny...... seriously that's not a joke, I'm dead fucking serious. one of my first memories ever in this world is my neighbours house exploding when I was 3. life literally  means nothing here.}
{That hook is awful}
{Big Sean's verse was so shit at first, then it got a little better. I think he should've only had the last half of his verse in the song. Or maybe replace him with someone in D12.}

{Reality vs Everybody. everybody wanna love work until there battery is dead and they need to put off there headphones , they wanna love coco & wear skinny jeans while dapping, they wanna scream panda instead of listening to lyrics with meaning. a beat is the most important thing in rap , said no OG in this hiphop scene ever. even tho i am not that old, this generation sucks , all sheeps following the way of the likes. no more interest in being smart. because vines & likes make you a good peron while you ignore poority. i'm glad rappers like eminem are still around. this guy eminen is  insane ,  because lyricly he raps like a god. no one can tip this guy in my opinion.}

{I wish Eminem would slow the fuck down and rap like his lyrics had an impact again. The Eminem Show, MMLP 1, even Encore and Relapse he had some great verses. But this I'm sitting here listening to this on my Mac Speakers and I can barely understand wtf he's saying. If I wanted that I'd listen to Future or Young Thug.  We get it you can spit fast and do fast hand gestures, but what happened to the cool Slim Shady? No hate I just don't want to see Eminem's flow falling like this.}

{#$0ulBr0tha$ 🎧⚛👀.❤️❤️❤️}
{Big Sean is an embarrassment to Detroit and the hip hop industry in general. He is corny and generic, usually sounds fake as fuck, can hardly be considered a lyricist. Worst of all, he probably doesn't live in Detroit or even Michigan, but still tries to rep it. Makes me sick.}
{Royce da 5'9 and Big Sean murdered this track... Of course Eminem got off, but Big Sean makes me rewind his verse every time I listen to this cut...}

{3:39}
{Eminem is simply killing this track}
{The beat reminds me of toy solider.}
{The music is mind blowing}
{Both Big Sean and Danny Brown make this song. Eminem isn't that good any more, and Royce Da 5'9", Dej Loaf, and Trick Trick were never good. This song would be shit if Big Sean and Danny Brown weren't born in Detroit.}

{I LOVE YOU EMINEEEEEEEM🌺💖}
{Totally underrated}
{Eminem raps so fast, I feel like English is my second language because I have to focus on listening and understanding faster}
{My fuckin God the king of rap mutha fuckas}
{This is easily the best shit Em ever wrote. If you're into rhyming, this is probably the most complex piece Ever. God damn...}
{*Greatest of all time. Mind of genius. Never seen anything like this* "It's still the [same] shit and {Shady's still a} {lady killer} Since the [day] I went in{sane and then a}ttacked the {babysitter} With a po{tato peeler}, and mushed her {face into the} enter{tainment center} It's like another {plane just entered} into U{kraine again Or} the Bermuda Tri{angle and a}ttempted to [make] a {safe descent A}{waiting any}one who {ain't affili}ated, it could be {danger Did ya} [make] ar{rangements with the} [gangsters] 'fore you [came] here? And if {they mention us}…"}

{Danny Brown L¡NWøøD}
{That snare rolling sounds similar to Like Toy Soldiers.}
{Still disappointed Kendrick isn't in this, I know he was born in Cali but still would have topped it.}

{Admit it... Marshal destroyed everyone.}
{partiu... buscar a tradução}

{ems verse REEEALLLLY grew on me.}
{M,s bit is easily the dopest!!}

{Eminem is way to good for these other rappers, half of them i do not even know their names, or just one song, Eminem should not be between these other men, if they are good, Eminem just killed them with his part.}
{big sean kills it , amazing}
{This is a mad tune}
{why rappers like drake and etc are so famous for songs that make no sense and Eminem who puts so much effort and every of his songs has an story is so down rated I'm so mad , I love you rapgod ! you're the best}
{eminen so cool in his song rapgod super fast}
{shit. Eminem is best rapping solo. He spoils every fking track when he raps with some one else in the track. Just doesnt fit.}
{I understand how people love Em's old flow and not his new one, but personally I think his faster flow works very well here, it's rapid-fire awesomeness! The only problem is that I can't catch 80 percent of what he's saying and I have to look up the lyrics haha.}
{It'd be better without dej loaf's annoying ass tbh}
{Eminem sempre foda, melhor Rapper vivo !}
{I like this line ...before my life became a movie(8mile)And they used to use my motherfuckin trailer to tease me with..(.trailer as in movie trailer and his trailer park home)..  before my life became a movieAnd they used to use my motherfuckin trailer to tease me with...}

{they added Big Sean to this song for one reason... they wanted the younger generation to feel the song too... they knew the young generation would have trouble following complex verses so they added Big Sean who rhymes slowly and keeps it simple}

{big sean had a better verse than eminem, SO WHO GIVES A FUCK? Eminems was still dope and seans verse was great but don't just be saying sean had the better verse for the sake of it, just to hate on Em. Remember how Eminem had the best verse on, Forever (Drake ft kanye, lil wayne, Em), Renegade (Jay Z ft Em), Patiently waiting (50 cent ft Em), Don't approach me & (Xzibit ft Em), Airplanes part 2 ( BOB ft Em), Welcome to D-Block  (The Lox ft.

{fantasticooooo da morire}
{i love you emonem ;)}
{For those of you who dont think Eminem was saying anything meaningful, ive taken the liberty of spelling out his verse. Lately it seems as if it's me against the world Like it was before my life became a movie And they used to use my mother fuckin' trailer to tease me with ( Reference to 8mile) But I flipped that script like like a refilla a Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal It made me feel amazing, navy seal of bravery (Reference to Act of Valor) And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script (Another reference to Act of Valor) Ain't bein' conceited But I made it to radio, eat a dick  I still never ABC'D the shit (As in followed someone elses plan) Mainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here Still and if I'm crazy, I'll always be real (Because he started out crazy and will stay crazy)  Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer Peel off back to the same block that we came from, on a rampage to crazy? For me to flip What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid While this track gets spanked like he just did (Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch Sick of bein' treated like me and shit (What do you think) But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features And them cyphers on BET cause  If I wasn't me, I probably wouldn't wanna play with me neither, shit (He plays with himself, but dosent recomend anyone else doing so, both funny and serious) Seems to be reachin' it's fever pitch One hundred and eighty degrees in here Shoulder blade full of cedar chips MC's just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish Or Lorena with a two penises Hateful and genius ness, inconvenience (inconvenience because he is to talented to diss because he is to genius with wordplay) And for the record, you don't want this type of static in your life When I'm makin' you cling to it (There are different types of static, also static makes things stick to you, and if you beef with him, you will live and die by that beef i.e his former slayen rap opponents) May consider tryin' to reinsulate ya windows may be in or another crazy winter (Or winner, as in this track is a winner) Cause so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away But ain't this really what made me into the angry bitter blond But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with ya And it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter With the potato peeler mushed her face into the entertainment center It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'for you came here? And if they mention He has not lost his skill, I think what were witnessing is a evolution in rap. Eminem could forsee his progressession in skill going unnoitced, thats why he said  "I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first. 'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse. That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse" -(Till I collapse) Sometimes your so good you would only understand it if your in that same state of mental maturity. This is the same frustration the great artist of former times felt when making their pieces. If you dont think eminem is the best lyricist to pick up a mic, its only because you can only appricate a simpler form of music, this is not an insult it just means you should develop your musical comprehension more.}

{Rating: 1. Eminem          - Great lyrics, beat, sound and speed 2. Royce Da 5'9" - Perfect sound, lyrics, awesome to start with 3. Big Sean         - Good sound, lyrics and rhyme, but isn't very good.. :/ 4. Danny Brown - He made me laugh, but at least he was good 5. Trick Trick      - He was supposed to talk that way, it is an outro, he wasn't singing 6. Dej Loaf          - Too bad voice, song was going to be better if it was with Rihanna or any other girl}

{Danny Brown's verse was ill, if you can't understand what this man is spittin then PLEASE go look it the fuck up...my man said they say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scizzorin...lmao Big Sean's shit was nice though too}
{Why is it people always have to talk about who is better at rapping,like their opinion is some divine spirit compared to others?most gens relate more to their gen of music.and as far as styles ,its just abstract idea that intertwine with people abstract opinions.could care less if youre into underground or mainstream.}

{danny brown is tha best!!!!!!!!!!!!!}
{Eminem has that tone change, madness and anger in his voice that really gets me.}
{I Don't know who the second guy is but its weak shit. Don't disrespect the place that made you.  and this is a full acknowledgement that a 5 second google search would add validity to this statement but I know that and still refuse to validate you by learning your name take your "Mr. Big Shot" and fuck off Detroit don't want or need you}

{This song is amazing, no question. However, I can't help but wonder if we should consider the true message in the song - Detroit is really struggling as a city to make ends meet. Somebody should do something about this, (Nicki Minaj voice) scratch that. I will do something about this. I realize that's a bold statement to declare, but with God by my side, anything is possible.}

{Best big Sean verse}
{Eminem killed it}
{who's the girl on the chorus?}
{Did you hear when Danny brown sounds like he was choking in his verse 😱😱😱}
{Big Sean and Royce killed that shit! and Em himself wasn't really with the flow man...that fast shit doesn't always work well. Em coulda been better and slaughter these dudes. He just ain't at his peak no more and no one want to admit it.}
{Danny Brown is fire}
{oh my god dej loaf is so fucking annoying}
{Not feeling Sean's verse (I just don't like his voice), Em's was a little weak compared to his other stuff, but DAMN, Danny and Royce killed it. EDIT: Dej Loaf reeks of Autotune to me. I really don't know if I like the song. Royce, Danny, and Em's verses are good, but the hook kinda stinks, and Sean just sounds so damn bored (and boring) to me.}
{def wil neva get over ur exist sweetness so dont be frontin stuntin.}
{Big Sean has no energy.  Blah.}
{big sean needs to humble himself...I have lived just as many lives...I wish I could walk and I have sold many records for them...I pushed your career with my HEART and MY SOUL...just to be called a bitch in another song}

{Eminem top 5 if not who is. Tupac Big Nas Kool G Rap Eminem}
{nwa shoulda made a California vs everybody}
{Why does Dej Loaf have to be in this? She is for 1. very annoying. For 2. She says "Datriot Verse Arrybody." And 3. She is trying to fit in and be popular in the video more than do good on lip syncing that horrid verse.}
{Nobody has noticed that most rappers are from Detroit?}
{❤ 🎼 😍 🔥 🎧 🌍}
{best to worst IN MY OPINION (in this song):Royce,big sean,danny,trick,eminem}
{"so futuristic Im already over my next bitch"  -Big Sean}
{IK most people didn't think Sean was one of the best on here, but the transition from Royce to him was FANTASTIC, and his first few lines hyped}
{this was lit man fuck the hatin asses. Dej was PERFECT on that hook. Song gave me chills.}
{This song is fire hold up not fire lava hold up not that it is magma}
{Sad how some people are dick riding fucking  big sean and eminem when Danny fucking Brown just outshines everyone Yeah, almost a year late, but fuck it}
{did someone notice how eminem flows with the snear? like wtf people always say his off beat lately but hes never.. he just double times but still on par with the beat..Eminem is still underrated till this day..cause hes white. no one wants to give a White guy in a black game the CROWN. Em has cover all types of subjects in his music..all types of beats from underground to poppy..all flows from laid back flow to double time..hes got it all. Still dont know why he still underrated to so many. This my honest opinion. Ooh and im more black than white cause im Puerto Rican lol.. Peace!}

{fa cl jou moeder}
{hoi}
{big sean and kendrick lamar are the future of rap. fuck drake and lil Wayne}
{Big Sean did go off on this with some great wordplay, but you can't say he beat Eminem. Em had better wordplay, and I guarantee most of it just went over your head. For example "You won't want this type of static in your life when I'm making you cling to it". That of course is static electricity making things cling (stick) to each other, and you cling to your life because he's killing you. His verse is filled with that from the very first line. On top of that he had the Adrian Peterson reference which was clever and hilarious. People love to hate on Em but he gets praised for a reason. Props to Big Sean and don't sleep on Royce either, but Eminem killed this song.}
{focking awesome}
{honestly every verse is great and Eminem is the GOAT but Danny Brown killed it}
{Did they ever get that remix to the hood?}
{Danny had the best verse Royce and Sean had 2nd Em had a good verse but it wasn't that good}

{I've lived in Michigan my whole life and I'm a high level industrial worker. Detroit is the city for me. LA and Miami is too superficial, Chicago and New York is too expensive. Detroit is getting better. Detroit is a cheep but powerful town. You can start a business for half the price compared to ANY big city. Detroit is the city of hopes and dreams. You don't need money to make it, just hard work.}
{Eminem starts at 3:39}

{Eminem rap god!}
{Eminem fans are the worst more specifically his casual hip hop fans, they tend to refuse to listen to other artist that aren’t on the radio yet claim that Eminem is greatest rapper that has ever lived, and it just gets worst when some motherfucker says “Oh he’s the greatest rapper in existence because he doesn’t rap about the same things other rappers talk about like drugs, women and violence.” What..the….fuck….have they been listening to…. Usually it’s some questionable looking white preteen to young adult prick with little knowledge on hiphop and his/her “favorite” genre Rock yet claims to be motherfucking Brainiac on the Genre. Fucking fuckington fuck fucking Christ every time I meet these kind of pricks I nearly loose it}

{October 2015... anybody !?!?!?!?!?}
{Eminem's verse: Lately it seems as if it's me against the world Like it was before my life became a movie And they used to use my mother fuckin' trailer to tease me with But I flipped that script like like a refilla a Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal It made me feel amazing, navy seal of bravery And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script Ain't bein' conceited But I made it to radio, eat a dick I still never ABC'D the shit Mainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer Peel off back to the same block that we came from, on a rampage to crazy? For me to flip What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid On the track get spanked like he just did (Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch Sick of bein' treated like me and shit But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me, I probably wouldn't wanna play with me neither, shit Seems to be reachin' it's fever pitch One hundred and eighty degrees in here Shoulder blade full of cedar chips MC's just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish Or Lorena with a two penises Hateful and genius ness, inconvenience And for the record, you don't want this type of static in your life When I'm makin' you cling May consider tryin' to reinsulate ya windows may be in or another crazy winter Cause so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away But ain't this really what made me into the angry bitter blond But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with ya And it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter With the potato peeler mushed her face into the entertainment center It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'for you came here? And if they mention. Sorry if I made some mistakes.}
{who is the second rapper hes goooooood}

{em and danny killed it}
{Who was the person before eminem}
{Who was the 4th person}
{I love this song.}
{danny brown weird lol}
{Danny Brown Is Really Underrated Smh...}
{HA! Dej Loaf thinks she's a good singer 😂😂  gotta be kidding me}
{I'm surprised they would ask big Sean to be on this track. He's pretty bad.}
{Where the fuck is Calicoe ?!}
{Can some guys of you name some good rappers in YOUR country? I dont need to list American's..I'm German, some good German Rappers are Kollegah, Sido, Bushido, Fler, Eko Fresh, Olexesh and Farid Bang probably, but there are much more! :)}
{litt}
{anybody know where you can find a version of this song without the hook? I like the song but dej loafs voice makes me want to stab myself in the eardrums with really any sharp instruments nearby.}
{they slaughtered the beat ...Big Sean completely evolved his flow nd Eminem i God....Salute to Detroit}
{Detroit!}
{охуенна}
{I think Dej's voice is too weak for the chorus.}
{У Eminem Детройт против всех, а у Oxxxymiron Лондон против всех, хмм... совпадение, не думаю)}

{HISSSSSSS. REPTILIAN BROTHERHOOD UNITE. 🐢🐉🐲🐊🐍🐢🐉🐲🐊🐍}
{i feel that big Sean or who ever is the second guy is a little pompous and very self centered in some of his lyrics. in this whole video Eminem is the best what's new. he raps about his life in all of his raps instead of sex and money like other rich snobby rappers. keep it up Eminem!!!!!!}
{I thought I was gonna hear team eastside n shit not this corny career rap shit}
{I swear em sacrifices flow just to try and impress everybody with speed}
{No other rapper complements Em like Royce except maybe Proof when he was alive.  Those two were made to rap together.}
{Eminen was the best on there}
{EVERYONE SOLID ON THIS ONE...SET THE WORLD ON FIRE #DETROIT4LIFE.... CHECK OUT EMPTY BOTTLE ENTERTAINMENT 'ANOTHER DAY"}

{God minem}
{royce is not human}
{Boy oh boy wish they would play Eminem in California but it seems like fucking Drake has corrupted the radio over here}
{rap epicooooo}
{Danny Brown has a really interesting voice.}
{oh my gosh they all had incredible verses, especialy eminem. if they just left prick-prick outta of this, then the song would be prefect}
{slim shady !}
{Danny brown yo !}
{royce !}
{I'm a big, Big Sean fan but his bars were absolutely garbage.... it sounded like something Kanye would want him to write I'm surprised Em let this one slip because he has a reputation to strive for perfection on every song & after Royce killed his bars you can't come in with that soft, mellow, garbage that Sean dropped with... it sounded like he stole some 9th grade kids rap diary..}
{Im one of eminem biggest fans, but in this song i like royce's verse the most}
{Danny's my favourite of all of them but I definitely think Royce went hardest on this.}
{i cant stop listening!}
{all you dumb asses who are saying Danny didn't kill it need to know that he had the best verse, go on rap genius my fellow hiphop heads!}
{fuck yeah Michigan vs everybody!}
{Em raps like his the god :-)}
{where's elzhi?}
{Dej loaf is shit}
{I couldn't make out most of what the fuck Em was saying! And Big Sean had one or two decent bars but this was DEAD let's be real}
{3:28 s/o to zelooperz}
{Danny brown and dej loaf ruin this song for me I love everything else about it though}
{Danny Browns voice is so annoying}

{Royce and big Sean killed this !!!}
{Eminem}
{maybe you wont agree with me, but why Big Sean?}
{why is nobody commenting on the fact that is says Trick Trick is in the song, but all he did was ramble at the end.}
{wow ems verse is fire}
{Kinda only like Eminems Lyrics in this 1, i find it more fitting}
{Eminem was and is still an icon, he will always be one of the best, but as much as this saddens me, he has lost his touch big time}
{You can't take Danny Brown seriously, even if you wanted to}
{EM is rap god}
{It shows hotdogs after he says lorana with two penises lolol.}
{Danny Brown  is fuckin garbage ruined the damn song.}
{Very funny lmao}
{danny brown a killer doh}
{MOST folks are sleepin on Danny brown ... man is he hard to understand , but everything he does if fire !}

{I ain't from D-town but you guys gotta respect this song.  and the hook is actually pretty good. em killed it who here is from Philly 😁😁😁}
{You get so hype when you hear Danny Brown}
{THIS SONG IS DOPE}
{Does anyone know what Def Loaf was saying???}
{eminem killed them}
{that lil boy singing tho chorus gonna be out of a job when his balls drop}
{Охуенчик!!!}
{Eminem isnt the best because of what he produces today, its the legacy hes left. No ones career in rap compares to what hes done in his past life}
{Danny uglyass literally just said 'they say my city tougher than two fat bitches scissoring' The fuark?}
{Everything in this song is fire, except for Danny Brown. Verse is terrible.}
{In the bridge is that a boy or a girl}
{Sorry but Eminem is the motherfucking best}
{now eminem say that again...}
{Noveliss in place of Big Sean please...}
{em all day}
{The song begins at 3:39}
{Eminem literally rhymed every word in that verse, who else can do that while at the same time, making sense and rapping about something? Just face it, he's the King.}
{Emmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm <3 <3 <3 I love u}
{WOW Eminem is so fast!}
{RAPPERS +  HIP HOP= 2 PAC}
{Whites kids don't know shit about Hip Hop. Eminem is NOT the GOAT !!! Eminem was murdered in this song but you got white kids here who are insisting that Eminem murdered them all. Eminem's flow in this song is not that good, face it. But Eminem will go down in history as one of the greatest of all the time. Probably in the top 5 of all time. The GOAT is 2 pac who was in the industry for less than 5 years but it took more than 10 years for Eminem, Jay, and Lil Wayne to to achieve what 2 pac achieved in 5 years. What about  CD sales and  Grammy? Well ask a typical white kid who is his favorite rapper Eminem and Macklemore is what you will hear, so obvious most of this white kids will buy Eminem CD regardless if it was wack or not . Whites are the majority in America. Just imagine, Macklemore got a hip hop Grammy but legend like Nas got zero Grammy, this already prove my point if you are a hip hopper. In short Eminem is not average, Eminem is one of the greatest of all time but NOT the true GOAT not at all !}
{Eminem the greatest ever!}
{eminem are rap garbage}
{actually royce n eminem n hopsin with sprinkle of beasty boys a bit of a rock vibe like berzerk best song ever}
{royce n em should a albim together}
{Big Sean's voice just doesn't suit the beat. His verse is good but his voice just doesn't work.}
{what the fuck did danny brown even say?}
{Respect to Em but I hate the way he pauses in this song. It feels sharp if that makes any sense. In my eyes it kills the flow but in total I guess it doesn't. I guess it makes him sound faster. As if we didnt already know that.}
{jesus i sweat to god eminem fans are the biggest dickriders ever, cant even admit Em fell off after the Eminem show}
{Who are they all in order?}
{shit still good}
{Eminem rocked it}
{Eminem rocked}
{that whiney ass voice annoys me but Danny's lyrics are dope but compared to ems aren't shit just saying}
{Damn.....i've watched this song over.............9000 TIMES!!!!!!!!!}

{eminem bitch}
{ыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыыы}
{I didn't understand what the fuck Danny brown said 😔 respect the hustle but I have to put my two cents in since that was straight garbage  🚽literally sounded like his nose wa plugged and he couldn't find his tongue. Straight gawbage (the game voice)}
{BigSeanEminem>The Others}
{US rappers are the best? Are we talking about english language only or all languages cause rap is in every language. As far as English, Ive heard some Muslims from London rapping the truth on NYC streets of Jamaica,  Queens and they were better then the guys I grew up with. And I know alot of rappers, some on tour right now. Even Ghostface said the UK rappers are raw and dont rap about alot of dumb bs you hear coming from younger American rappers. Underground is where its at.}
{CAN WE BE FUCKING HONEST DANNY BROWN RUINED THE SONG CAUSE HE IS A FUCKING BIRD}
{Big Sean >>> Eminem}
{I love this song so much}
{This was really good! I liked everybody and was pleasantly surprised by Big Sean. Not dissing him. I enjoyed everyone's lyrics, they held their own But...EM is EM and to me was the best among them all. To people saying he lost his flow, uhm, no, he didn't. Get your ears checked, maybe your brain couldn't catch up to his wavelength. Mine did just fine. He is faster and yes, his flow has changed, evolved, but Never lost. People always hating on him and I would like to know why because there are no facts to back that up. The beat to this track is hot! Haters will hate but EM, was, is, always will be, a Phenomenal Rap God! 😈}
{I remember when this was getting transcribed on Rap Genius and no one could understand what Brown was saying :p}
{Can never get tired of this song}
{минус бодрый}
{I'm a day one, die-hard eminem fan so obviously i loved his verse. but Big sean's verse though?????? bruuuh. sooooo good!!!!}
{I wish Obie Trice was in this song.}
{Sean's flow >>>>>}
{big sean killed it}
{I know u white people are being loyal to ur dude but em had worst verse  1.big sean 2.royce 3.danny 4.white boy (I'm disappointed, it was a 9 you made it a 7 gud job)}
{it sounds like Jon Lajoie to me}
{hes a legend........you guys know what i mean.........just accept it....}
{3:36 its Eminem}
{but have they done a fire in the booth?? mostly English people know}
{fight me!}
{I really wanna like everyone on this track, but I find Danny Brown hard to listen to :/}
{I love all these negative comments about each individual rapper in this song XD Most of the negative comments are either directed at Big Sean or Eminem, for once can you haters please just shut the fuck up! I totally understand if you guys are giving constructive criticism, that's totally fine but to base your arguments on opinion is nonsense because a debate like that goes nowhere. Stop wasting your time typing hate and just DON'T LISTEN TO THE SONG IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT! Man, focus your damn attention on important shit like the presidential election. You go to music videos/lyric videos to listen to music or learn the song not fill the comments section with nonsense. You go to the comments section for constructive criticism or your review of the song not to play "music critic". Fuck man, you guys are not even professional rappers so how can you guys damn every rapper here if you're not even experts! You don't like the song? That's what the "dislike" button is for, FUCK!}
{Royce da 59 sound stupid}
{Eminem kills it like usual}
{Danny brown is the most unique in this song and has really good lyrics, so why all the hate?}
{PLEASE can someone tell me what coat Eminem wear in this clip ??? I know it is a Carhartt but I can't find this one on the internet :'(}
{Eminem...out of em-unittion. At least he did better than Royce and Danny...but he didnt fuck with Sean which suprised me}
{You bitches is corny saying Big Sean beat Em on this, ya'll probably think B.o.B got Em on Airplanes Part 2... *Smfh*}
{I prefer Shady over any of these rappers most of the time but I'll admit that Sean was the best in this song. The topic is obviously representing Detroit and its culture and Sean seemed to incorporate more of that into his lyrics than Em. I can't agree that it was simply harder to digest because it just didn't seem like Em expressed Detroit in the way that Big Sean did. I like Em and I think he is one of the best but if I were to give an unbiased opinion then coming down to how sick the rhymes were I'd give it to Shady but down to the meaning Sean takes this one.}
{Eminem killz it again!}
{who listening to this is actually from Detroit?}
{eminem raps so fast but i love his style}
{royce 5'9 is so underratted  his lyrics are up there with eminem .. actually he is the only one who can stand with eminem}

{Danny brown hyped me up cause he's not a "mainstream" artist}
{I really liked this}
{Now, Thats how you literally spit gold!}
{I loved all of them. They all did a fantastic job. The song was extremely strong through and through. I personally would rank Eminem on the top, partly because he had the most to say, and partly because he is just a spectacular rapper. The rest I would say Danny Brown, then Royce, and last Sean, but those three are separated by a thread. They all did a phenomenal job. All you people arguing about who's best are forgetting the fact that this is all subjective. Every rapper mentioned here has their merits. I personally like Biggie more than Pac for example. Imo Pac also has some phenomenal songs, but overall I like more of Biggie's work. Nas is an outstanding rapper also. If you guys want a better argument, try to judge them on a category. Leaving it to overall is much harder. Just don't let the argument keep you from enjoying (opinion alert) one of the best songs of the decade.}
{chico bean changed his name to royce da 5'9"?}
{Danny Brown is a fucking baller}
{Tupac started the book of rap. Eminem finished it. Pitbull couldn´t read it and Iggy Azalea lost the book.}
{the tweak right before Eminem ruined the song}
{Danny's first line>Royce, Big Sean and Eminem hole verses}
{Крутооо}
{Big Sean should've saved that feature for a better song.}
{Royce da 5"9 killed this shit}
{Saved the best for last!}
{Anyone else think danny didn't flow well?}
{i dont say this very often, but i dont think eminem had the best verse on this song. royce and big sean killed it. good sing, till that weird voice happened.}
{RESPECT.... SICK!}
{fuck me man. Em is my hero..}
{Trump 2016}
{omg}
{Eminem is clearly the best.}
{that guy who rap after royce... his verse rape the stage... like it so much... but eminem still the fastest one...}
{7 k people has something wrong with brain to press dislike.}
{lo máximo.  a partir del min 3.38}
{Eminem es increíble, 🏻🔆🎧🎧}
{i prefer eminem}
{ride or die}
{He made the okay hand sign with his hand. Haven't seen that since my childhood years in the 90s. I'm in my midlife crisis years now, but that was cool to see.}
{Those hipster glasses make Detroit look HARD!}
{Not that anyone cares, this is what I think of this track. Royce's verse was the best because of his tone and vigour, not to mention his genius use of language and word play. Next would be Eminem. He puts a shit ton of emotion into every song he makes (eeeh, maybe not G.O.A.T., but let's go back to forgetting that exists, k thanks) and this song is no exception. Also, his words are just very inspirational and fuck everyone-y, so that's always a plus. Then I would say Danny Brown is next best. He's a bit hard to understand, but still awesome. Then in dead last, is Big Sean. No amount of 'clever' lines can make up for that monotonous delivery....}
{eminem is pretty much the best in my oppinion so clear when rapping}
{I love the random voices in the background. "Where DA hoes at?" 💀}
{Я из России)))}

{eminen = the boss}
{i dont have a single fuckin clue what the fuck that danny brown man said o.O}
{why are niggas that hate on eminem always unable to pull out evidence (lyrically)?  like right here in this fucking MV. big sean's verse is so fucking newschool corny that id much rather listen to eminem any day. whiteboy the only real gangster here with a history more fucked up than all these boys put together.. what the fuck.. if you not gonna quote lyrics to say why eminem is shit, please dont even reply.}
{Big Sean killed it.😵🔥}
{i ONLY came here for Danny Brown XD LMFAO his verse is the shit}
{DANNY BROOOOOOWWWWN!!!!!!!}
{All people who say Eminem is the best rapper don't have a good idea of what Hip-Hop is. I feel most people (sorry to say but mostly white people) only say that because his music and voice has a Rock feel to it. If he rapped to more real (strict) Hip-Hop beats, like Asher Roth for example, I doubt they'd be saying that.  He's good but don't call him the best rapper when his music doesn't really have Hip-Hop feel to it. And just because he battle rapped in a movie doesn't mean he can do it for real. So far most of his is pretty much written anyway.}
{I wanna see a Detroit vs. Compton}
{Fucking dope guys}
{why is pac so overrated?  i wouldn't even but him in same category as biggie nas or em. yeah he was a real gangster that rapped about it so what he was weak lyrically.}
{So glad you can slow the speed down can actually hear eminem lyrics}
{In my opinion if J.Cole, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem, Drake, and Chance the rapper made a song it would set the world on fire :P}
{Ok not hating love the song but did anyone understand a fucking word danny brown said?}

{Man...This song is amazing. They all killed it but I think Eminem killed this. Thumbs up for all rappers on this song! Eminem, royce and big sean inspired me. I'm a 17 year old rapper that earned 3,000 subscribers in less than a year. No, I'm not as good as these rappers and I don't have the equipment to make the best quality music but i save up every penny I got to be able to afford some studio sessions. Check out my LATEST tracks, you won't be disappointed.}

{Em doing this now for pure pleasure, his legacy was cemented at 30, its all business now as a corporate person. He don't care about what newbies think about him versus what they are hearing now from these less matured rappers. He just stacking paper and artists and pushing shady records its not even about his personal album sales.}

{Dej loaf is a trash... Dont understand why is everyone giving her so many credits}
{I see people talking bout they don't like the new Eminem. Did you know that he had to go through severe detox and got clean. After that he literally couldn't write any more and he had to relearn how to write like he did. So this new Eminem is the clean drug-free Eminem. So if you want the old Em, you gotta convince him that being drugged up is more worth it than being clean LOL. I agree his new stuff is not crazy like his older stuff. But there's a reason for that so as for me, I gotta appreciate that fact.}
{I have listened to all of Eminem's music. This is definitely one of his best pieces however not his best. Great verse for all of them really! But Eminem and Sean really crushed it!}

Top shit, this is fucking great. 6yrs later Edit: Where the f*ck is pt 2. Big Sean has been (for 4yrs) my favourite verse in this song, didn't even know I commented on this track 😂, come back like once a month usually while drunk as f*ck. 2022 and this is still a banger!}

{Anyone else feel like Dej Loaf is blowing it? the song was so good, then she came in...}
{Big Sean is the next big thing! He goes hard in this track and on every track in Dark Sky Paradise, besides IDFWU, which was horrible in my opinions. Eminem is old news now.}
{I think its funny when people say they can't understand em because he "raps to fast" or he's just "rambling" dude is actually keeping up with modern day news but you morons are to busy watching/listening to ass titties and guns all the time that you don't know what anyone is saying if the words have more than one syllable in them. I'm not even a huge em fan but there is a reason every single rapper in the game respects him and wouldn't dare to step to him. Sean killed it in my opinion. that's what I love about rap it doesn't just have to be one person that gets on the track and kills it.}
{and dey loaf}
{danny brown big sean Eminem n tht hook wt evr her name is she nailed it thy need to make more shit like this dis some g ahit rite here im from buffalo but hey lets get it detroit again dis shit nice Asfk}

{DAAAAAAAAMMMMNNNNNNNNNNN.}
{Good thing i live in Detroit}
{These are the type of beats and lyrics that should be on the radio,  Subscribe to my channel for some real hip-hop}
{If they put Elzhi in Danny Brown's place this song would be perfection. Em, Royce, and Sean all slay this. Had no idea Big Sean could spit like that before I heard this.}
{Stop hating on Eminem he  is more successful then your asses}
{I see a lot of people complaining in the comments that Em "changed". Of course he changed, hes in his 40's now. Hes not going to rap like hes 27 again. He's an artist, and artists dont keep re-painting the same picture over and over again. This is who he evolved into, and hes still dope! Be happy that we have someone who loves the craft, is a great lyricist, and rhymes about real shit still. We shouldnt be complaining when you see so much dumbed down garbage around. - If anyone's just chillin out on youtube for a bit and wants to check some true meaningful hip hop, check me out and let me know what you think. Not trying to spam like everyone does tho, just sayin if your relaxing sittin back looking for something to do, check it out in my channel!}

{New York can rekt Detroit any time}
{Lol, people can't even have an opinion on eminem without getting called a dick riding fanboy.  He's definitely a top 3 rapper imo}
{Big sean went stupid on this song. He definitely had the best verse. Its cool if you say Em is a better rapper because Em is a legend and has earned his plaques and accolades but Sean is hungry and he tore up his verse. Also I feel like Sean still has a lot to say where as Em is just rapping to rap now. I don't feel that much emotion in his lyrics anymore, he just putting words together and mashing a whole bunch of them fast just for the fuck of it which there is nothing wrong with that really i'm just saying that's what I see. I also don't see the appeal with Danny Brown. Maybe its his voice that throws me off lol}
{LA WIN ALL DAY NIGGAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!}
{They all killed it, but Danny Brown tho, that man knows what he's doing. Anybody else notice that its always Eminem last??}

Your eyes are burning a bit right now, because you are addicted to your PC, like me. 4. You noticed that I doubled 3. 5. Big Sean is cool. 6. You thought I was going to be average and say "You just looked". 7. But you did look. 8. Brittany Spears is Illuminati, want proof? 9. Brittany Spears has 14 characters, she likes alcohol, alcohol has 7 letters, do 14-7, you get 7. She is also known to make songs about mean things she has done, mean has 4 letters, 7-4=3, Illuminati confirmed. 10. I did not copy and paste this, I just have no life so I decided to type this while looping Detroit Vs. Everybody.}

{plz suscribe my youtube chanel}
{They all kill it, but Big Sean is on another level with this track.}
{Dopest.  #Detroit  Vs.  #Everybody}

{I feel like this song is so underrated.}
{i love em and all but his new flow isnt for him.he wasnt ment for fast rapping in my opinion}
{Royce Da 5'9 look JUST like the crackhead I pass every morning on the way to work.  Seriously.}

{I feel like this song should've blown up or is it just me?}
{Y}
{Detroit gives Michigan a bad name and this song doesn't help.}
{Lol I can't stand ppl who say Em isn't the same or will never be the same. Like no shit. This is 2015, a lot has changed. We won't get the Eminem we knew back in the day but you better believe that I'll bump his old shit till I die. Everyone that's hating on him now was never a true fan to begin with lol}
{Video is well over 90% liked. It's just youtubes shitty comments section pushing the hate comments up. Calm down, people.}

{someone make an edited version without that one fucker who goes right before eminem}
{This is a very coll song}
{Bruh, I've always thought that track Infinite that Em did back in the day was his best work, until now. Em's verse on this shit is beyond dope. The delivery, the flow, and those bars. It's so good to see an artist who didn't dumb down all his shit to too appeal to the brain dead. Em's one of the few emcees that stayed true to what hip hop is really about.}

{Eminem killed this track listen to the rhyme scheme and how he connects his words, every other word rhymes even big Sean said eminen killed it, big Sean decent but not on shadys level hip hop about life story's and rhymes and how good you can put it together that's the art of it or to put a story together as poetry.}

A toss between Royce and Eminem. 3. Big Sean. 4. Danny Brown Overall I love this track. All of them killed it. I just hope that Obie was included in this track.

{simply the best lyrical rapper who has ever walked on this planet...gues who is he}
{Big Sean had some nice verses but I truly didn't feel any substance behind his voice like no energy at all, seemed a little out of place on the beat imo. Honestly Danny and Royce we're the most on point (Royce murdered this intrumental) even Em felt a little lackluster... Good verses but no real substance or passion in his voice.}
{That's very nice video}
{Em kill it.}

{Atlanta Rappers: Hard to understand Chicago Rappers: Always on house arrest Detroit Rappers: No problems}
{________________? I'm sure it was not able, I have to go back. it will not have the ability for you}
{Trick Trick has always been a big supporter of Detroit I think its awesome that he gave that speech at the end of the video. .}
{Wish I was from Detroit I would celebrate to this song}
{Big Sean killed it man}
{"This song is so good I wish I was from Detroit" "I wish I was from Detroit so I could maybe be here" Are you sure? This song would be better if most of the good rappers from Detroit didn't die. Detroit might make you a badass, but it has more chances of getting you killed. People, please do not think of moving to Detroit just because good rappers come out the ass from there, it's just because most people there are inclined to rap because of challenges, but a lot of times that gets them killed. Like if you agree.}
{Top 5 Rappers  1. Mozart 2. Cristiano Ronaldo 3. Bon jovi 4. Bob Marley 5. Me 6. Supa hot fire Honorable mentions : Angela Merkel, Eminem, Tupac, Leonardo di Caprio, Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, Silvio Berlusconi, DMX.}
{For e everyone complaining about why they favorite artists not in this video, it's about Detroit artist, that's the point of the video.}

{I see a lot of people complaining in the comments that Em "changed". Of course he changed, hes in his 40's now. Hes not going to rap like hes 27 again. He's an artist, and artists dont keep re-painting the same picture over and over again. This is who he evolved into, and hes still dope! Be happy that we have someone who loves the craft, is a great lyricist, and rhymes about real shit still. We shouldnt be complaining when you see so much dumbed down garbage around. - If anyone's just chillin out on youtube for a bit and wants to check some true meaningful hip hop, check me out and let me know what you think. Not trying to spam like everyone does tho, just sayin if your relaxing sittin back looking for something to do, check it out in my channel!}

{Y'all are hating on Danny (I'm not saying he had the best verse) but he was the only one who actually rapped about Detroit his whole verse. He talked about the Ketteran and Bernstein's son which only Detroit natives would know about. (I don't currently live there but I have before)}

{Song was awesome 😍 big sean and eminem really killed it better}
{It was good}
{All of you that are picking on each other saying that the Eminem was the best and you aren't a true fan if you think his new stuff is good, you're wrong. If you are a true fan of Em', you would like all of his music. You wouldn't be afraid to blare it as loud as you can in front of anyone. I guess that makes me a true fan. I challenge you to discover if you are a true fan. Look up Eminem on YouTube and listen to every song that shows up until you find a song that you don't like. Then listen to it until it gets catchy. I dare you...}
{Royda kills it}
{Big Sean was best imo}
{the only this is the lady who sings kills it bad}

{WOW! AWESOME! 6 RAPPERS!}
{Lol Detroit wont last a rap battle against Chiraq}
{IM in no way shape or form a dick rider of Eminem I love Hip hop in general but who ever does see the lyricism in his new style is flat out hating or doesn't understand hip hop in the slightest this verse was pretty good but Speedom was off the charts good as was his verse in best friend this dude is easily the best mainstream artist in the game right now not even a slight debate about it I love underground hip hop and 90s shit the most like Ra the rugged man Binary Star Masta Ace Mf doom  Nas but if you dont think Em is absolutely destorying the game with BARS right you your either one of those people who hate on Eminem because its the "cool" thing to do or you have ZERO knowledge of Hip hop I dare anyone to test me on this and ill bury you with facts}
{I Love that !}
{This song goes helllaaaaa hard}
{Love this song so much reply if you agree}
{3:39 you're welcome :)}
{It must be amazing to be an artist who gets heard from around the world. i just recently released my first ever music video and i put alot of work into it. People think artists care about the fame and money when trying to gain views. The reality of the matter is that in the end of the day i gained not a single dollar from your view or anyone elses....what i gained was way more. I gained a listener...someone who now knows more about me that my closest friends dont even know because they dont even take the time to analyze my music or apply it to themselves. I just want to be able to sing on and see that my blood and sweat paid off because i gained a thousand ears across the world.}
{Bruh.....love this song its amazing but does anyone notice how dej loaf sounds like she has a cold......and danny brown looks like a old erckle.}
{I came here just to see You EMINEEEEEM <3}
{Eminem's definitely gotten better since he released MMLP2, seriously, Recovery and Relapse were alright I guess,  but everything afterwards is just DAMN.., Except for the tracks where he sings.}
{I am a rapper that wants to inspire others. I'd appreciate anyone who checks out my music}
{You can say what you want but if EM wasnt in this tune the views would have been 90% lower.whoever is the best?there is no best,they are all good,like camparing pizza and pizza, depending on the mood you want one kind just that day.peace out...}

{Who is the 2nd rapper}
{Big Sean killed it}
{When  I  listen  to  Eminem  's  Music, I  forget  everything}
{This is so good in multiple levels... excuse my bad level of english but Eminem once again shows why he is one of the best. Greetings on Finland ;)}
{But eminem had some sense he is like 43 he has spent most time detroit so this is some deep stuff for him}
{6,701 dislikes. Bet they can't rap faster than Dej Loaf ROFL}
{For me personally Royce had the best verse and the best flow, followed by big Sean and then eminem, I am a HUGE eminem and I've literally heard every one of his songs from the first album to the this one right here, but you have to give credit where it's due.}

{dej loaf voice is like nails on a chalkboard}
{....I only came here for shady}
{this song is old from Bad meets Evil best Eminem album ever!}
{It's really telling how this is the closest hip hop song Eminem has done in years and it ironically has the least amount of views. Just goes to show that 50% of his fans don't even listen to hip hop and only know Em from Recovery.}
{Wait... wait... Someone please tell Big Sean he in the wrong video... lol come on dawg, he needed to rewrite his verse for this one track over like 10 times, he knew this but aint do it. This aint a GOOD music track bro. Smh first Control now this, ga damn it}

{Yall stop playing, Big Sean murdered everybody on this}
{He killed me at the "attacked the baby sitter with a potato peeler"part at 5:03}
{You guys are dumb for pitting all of these rappers against each other. You missed the point if you think that was to show out and see which one carrying their city on their back- its not em vs Danny vs dej vs big Sean vs trick trick!  They are unified in their representation they are all holding it down. Detroit vs everybody! If you aren't detroit don't stand the f*ck up.  That's it.  So why you're comparing detroit vs detroit right now makes no sense to me.  If you think any one of them did better than the other Detroit is the greatest so contest is over.}

{Like 3 years ago eminem was the Messiah but like hes so monotonous now. Maybe it's just been the over listening to him or me finding rappers that I think are lyrically supreme but his lyrics are just plain mediocre. Like oh look there's another metaphore that rhymes with the simile.

{Shame Em became a better rapper in terms of flow, delivery, and putting together rhymes but he just can't write a song to save his life anymore. They're either corny as all hell, or just generic. Though when he throws out something like this where he just goes off, it's still dope.}

By the way, how come nobody has mentioned Royce? He had the best verse by far.}

{THIS IS LIFE!!!!}
{<3}
{3:15 lmao who is this guy? I actually like it, but his voice is hilarious. "wanh wanh wanh neeya wanh!"}
{Lol, I was thinking about the responses that could have been made and it is funny as hell. Just as Shady used a big city, I'm not gonna use neighborhoods. For example, NYC is not getting split into Brooklyn and Queens and shit. Here it is Los Angeles: K-Dot, Schoolboy Q, Earl Sweatshirt, Snoop Dogg and a Frank Ocean Hook NYC: Nas, Jay-Z, Joey Badass, A$AP Rocky and Alicia Keys Hook Chicago: Kanye, Chance the Rapper, Lupe Fiasco, Chief Keef? with a BJ the chicago kid hook Atlanta: Killa Mike, Childish Gambino?, Andre 3000, T.I and a Bino hook Houston: Riff Raff vs Everybody Drake and Iggy Azalea: White bitches vs Everybody}
{Let me give you some advice. Em is not the greatest of all time in anyone's book. Hell, he isn't even top 5 for me but he is top 10. Recently, he has been wack. It has not been his flow or word play or being sober. It is that he has been rapping the same shit for the past 10 years. It seems like he is trying to remake 8 mile on 3/4's of his albums and on the other quarter he tries to sound hardcore but comes off corny as fuck. His punchlines are way too cheesy and don't fit with the hardcore flow he tries to spit. In my opinion when I look at musical careers, I see Kanye as the better artist. Sure, em has better flow and maybe even better wordplay but Kanye drops projects that all have a different sound and plus he produces. Comparing 2013, Yeezus was a top 15 album of the year and MMLP2 might squeak the top 30 and I did not really enjoy Yeezus. Em needs to drop a final album in the form of an ep that closes his career. It pains me to see him regress like this. Even on this mediocre record, I didn't think he had the best verse. Since everything I heard was about flow, Danny Brown had the best flow in my opinion. I will keep being an Em fan but he very overrated. You guys should listen to more hip hop besides Em and his posse. The world is very big. Listen to the new releases. For the people hatin on "new school" because of 2 chainz, Big Sean, and Lil Wayne, keep in mind that the purpose of those albums are to bang at parties. Many new school artists have the "listening" vibe where you can just sit down and listen to the album like Joey Bada$$, Childish Gambino, and Kendrick Lamar. Then there are the combos that spit "ok" but have amazing flow such as Danny Brown, ASAP Rocky, and Chance the Rapper. The best artists traverse both these realms. Right now, Eminem is not in any of them, I can't play this in the car, I can't play this while working out, I can't sit down with a coffee in a Starbucks and listen, I can't study to this. Em has lost his niche in his purpose as well. You guys should notice that.}

Eminem is inspiration to all people, artist or none artist love him. He came from nothing and made it hear, He was giving a chance n blew up, If he wasn't giving that chance we would never hear of him. As an artist thats all i need, Is a chance 2 minutes of your time to listen to my song "can't Sleep" and you will see i have potential to be one of the best ever.}

{I like Tupac's style of rapping. He doesn't rap extremely fast and I could understand and appreciate his lyrics more. He also a had nice voice which is a bonus. I really like Eminem, but half of the time I can't understand what he's saying. His lyrics should be more straightforward. It's like reading a book written by an author who thought using a large vocabulary means it's a deep and smart book. Again, this is why I like Tupac's style of rap, his lyrics are simple but still beautifully written. When you're trying to tell a complex story, your writing should be simple so people aren't overwhelmed. I only listened to Tupac after I became a fan of Eminem, but I could clearly see why Tupac is considered better.}

{I see a lot of people complaining in the comments that Em "changed". Of course he changed, hes in his 40's now. Hes not going to rap like hes 27 again. He's an artist, and artists dont keep re-painting the same picture over and over again. This is who he evolved into, and hes still dope! Be happy that we have someone who loves the craft, is a great lyricist, and rhymes about real shit still. We shouldnt be complaining when you see so much dumbed down garbage around. - If anyone's just chillin out on youtube for a bit and wants to check some true meaningful hip hop, check me out and let me know what you think.

Everyone delivered. Even Big Sean, never thought I would like a verse by him til I heard this song a few months back. Well everyone but Dej Load and Trick Trick. Ya Dej did the hook, cool whatever.

{Em's my #1 favorite rapper, but I am a big enough fan to be real. He could've come wayyyy harder than he did. Big Sean is the only one who did an excellent job. His lyrical skills and rhyme scheme was amazing and his punch lines were killer. I am becoming a big fan of him. The rest of the artists were terrible.}

{DOPE!!😀}
{Royce is so underrated! He was by far the best in this his flow is unmatchable every time. Big Sean was good. Danny was???? I don't even know he's voice annoys me. Em went in hard but I will admit it got a bit "samey" all in all. Royce killed it}

{EASTSIDE OF DETROIT IN THIS BITCH}
{I use to idolize eminem, want to be like him, then my dick got stuck in the wind, and I can't remember when the last time I felt this good, shit, I may not be from the hood and I might be white but you misunderstood these lyrics if you think I'm not lyrically ill enough to kill your whole crew with a couple of .22's up your assholes, it's not about the cash flow or the hoes, it's about letting you know I can and will make it to the top, rock the top, shoot a cop, you can all suck a cock, never gave a damn since the first day a gun was in my hand, goddamn, you thinkin' I'm crazy yet, I just raised the roof like a fucking vet----ERAN in the gulf war callin' every bitch a whore, get 'em wet and slidy, more like a spiderman fan named spidy, goddamn, and I just killed this mic tonight with a couple more rhymes I might have your wife.}

{Wayyy too much hate on Danny. Y'all just be hearing him for the first time and judging him just on this song. Smh, ACTUALLY LISTEN TO HIS MUSIC. XXX and Old are one of the greatest albums I've ever heard. I understand if you don't like him becase of his voice (it grows on you the more you listen to him), but other than that, give me a valid reason you hate him. Listen to some of his other songs (not gonna put any party songs because whe know haters are gonna be like "this isn't real rap hue hue hue")  -25 bucks -Torture -DNA -Float On -Side A (old) -Gremlins -Grown Up -30  Listen to all of these songs, then tell me he's garbage}

{Represent. #DetroitVsEverybody}
{My favorite part, the flow is just.. "I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with your relation, changin' it It's still the same shit and Shady's still..."}
{Follow the fucking rhyme schemes here, Holy Shit "And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script Ain't bein' conceited But I made it to radio, eat a dick I still never ABC'd the shit Mainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit And if I ever end up escapin' these streets I swear that I would stay here still And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer Peel off back to the same block that we came from, on a rampage too crazy for me to flip What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid On a track get spanked like he just did (DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch Sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit Seems to be reachin' its fever pitch One hundred and eighty degrees in here Shoulder blade full of cedar chips MCs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish Or Lorena with two penises Hateful and geniusness inconvenience And for the record, you don't want this type of static in your life When I'm makin' you cling to it"}
{No joke}
{Eminem Has a net worth of 250000000$}
{Eminem the best}
{In all honestly, ya'll sayin Big Sean right behind Eminem, but forget bout Royce Da 5'9. He easily has the best flow, after Eminem. Big Sean's flow is chill, and he has decent to good lines, but for real i think Royce is hella underrated.}

{They call me the magic man. Empirical theorist. Creating symbiosis between primary secondary knowledge information. Data which will twist cripple a regular man`s mind, the knowledge being cancer whereas the cancer is I. Thousands upon thousands of words, blended into a mix of stochastic mathematical theory.

{I'm not the biggest Danny Brown fan but so many of your comments are idiotic. Yes he does have an annoying voice and I understand it CAN be hard to understand his words from time to time, but I'm sure if you guys can use your brain, you will understand -_- and his lyrics are actually decently good. Just shows the state of rap fans today, nobody tries to understands an MC's lyrics anymore, only if he sounds good. "If you think your hood harder then I might beg to differ Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller If the blicka hit your kisser, bet your ass not remembering So nigga, I'm a veteran, retire like letterman"}

{Is it bad I thought Dej Loaf was a 15 year old boy?}
{I see a lot of people complaining in the comments that Em "changed". Of course he changed, hes in his 40's now. Hes not going to rap like hes 27 again. He's an artist, and artists dont keep re-painting the same picture over and over again. This is who he evolved into, and hes still dope! Be happy that we have someone who loves the craft, is a great lyricist, and rhymes about real shit still.

{People say that Eminem fell off and has bad music now. If you really are a fan, you don't like how cool something sounds. You care how it affects you and how what it means to the people that you know. This isn't his "coolest" song, but it is great. Along with Lose Yourself, Beautiful, Mockingbird, and Not Afraid, it means a lot and inspires you to push through. I have to give a lot of my thanks to Eminem among many others. To everyone who's lives Eminem changed, embrace it. Peace}

Hearing about him going through a door and breaking his back, lol, that stuff was new. Cousin and I laughed like crazy hearing his stuff... Then came soldier, man. I had that stuff on mp3, knew it word for word... could rap all his songs... I think Eminem show was the last album I really loved.... Went through a lot of changes in life I didn't think was gonna come... I laid of music, quit writing my own stuff... I dunno man, back then Hailie was young then, I was still pretty old, can't believe her now man... anyway, this track is good everyone killed it. You guys are blessed... Keep your eyes on the future. Hope everyone makes good choices.... Hope we don't see the chip in this lifetime, but consider it if it comes...}

{Eminem is the best one}
{List of best verses from this song. 1. Big Sean (His flow is amazing but he took like half the song and fell off at the end but the first half is amazing.) 2. Between Danny and Royce. (Danny has amazing lyrics and ok flow.) (While Royce is just Royce and I feel he needed a longer verse.) 3. Eminem 😯😣 (Why is eminem gotta be the worst when he is the best lyricist since tupac. First off his flow is okk I guess. But he took up alot of the song and he must f not been feeling the beat. His lyrics sucked in this and I feel he could of did a better job but I still feel all these rappers did good just some did better then others.) Props to Big Sean for making the top verse on this list (I don't even care for him) and for eminem😢 Plz don't make something like this again}

{I see eminems talent i really do.. but i cant stand his flow.. it really doesnt go with the beat i feel like.. he making up this weird as flow as he goes along.. no disrespect but alot of people tend to just expect people to love eminem, but he really is different from most rappers and for some of us it just too weird}
{he dont get enough credit man but big sean killed his shit}
{N.W.A. LYRICS "Quiet On Tha Set" (Listen to this) [Eazy E:] Yo Ren ! [MC Ren:] Whassup ? [Eazy E:] Take (one) [MC Ren:] Yo (Hit it) [MC Ren:] Ruthless, plenty of that and much more So at the party, Ren is controllin the floor that you step and do your danceroutine It ain't a dream my man, you're in a gangsta scene with a villain doin damage on a 24 track With confusion to finish my conclusion Arhytomatic rhymes from a radio cat You can't take what I got coz I'll be takin it right back [Ruthless gangsta] Cold killin You wanna know what it's means ? (definition...villain) With the stupid dope rhyme So once you hear one line you can tell it's mine With a baseball cap that's black that I'm wearin and a look that keeps you all starin and wondering why I'm invincible But when you hear my rhyme, it's convincible I don't take no shorts while I'm constructin the ground that makes y'all move around to my hell of a sound Girls drool on me like a dyin [Dr.Dre: ] (Yo Ren, tell'em what they do when you start rhymin) I go to the party. I hip a hop the spot I dunno what it is, but the girls get hot aspirin like they're on fire and their so-called boyfriends with'em are retirin And for this reason I'm a walkin threath So when I'm on stage I want...(Ssssht) [Eazy E:] Quiet on tha set (Light, camera, action) [Eazy E:] N.W.A. take (two) [MC Ren:] Now to get started with my musical profession A gangsta or villain in mine is in session The way that I'm referrin to this makes ya move ya butt but don't stand in a daze, yeah you should know what's up Anyway I keep the clappin along coz nothing bad could go wrong because this song is so strong [?? huh ?? I'm ???] who could ask for anything more when N.W.A. is cold rockin the floor like stupid, actin like a retard waitin for a bumrush, gettin to the good part It tips me so with temptation writin my lyrics with this hyped information Just look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines [Eazy E: Boy you should have known by now] It's mine ! Unpredictable, keepin you extremely enjoyed It's irresistable, meanin that you can't avoid And while I'm on stage, look forward to sweat but after I rip it up I want...(Ssssht) [Eazy E:] Quiet on tha set (Light, camera, action) [Eazy E:] N.W.A. take (three) [MC Ren:] I can be loud as hell, think I will ? (Never) (Ssssht) [Eazy E:] (Quiet on tha set) Yeah I like that better (?? huh ?? As what I can do ??) I think I earn respect And if I didn't from you, that's what I expect coz if it ain't ruff it ain't me So who really cares how you want me to be See, I'm just me standin at the top of the pile and doin soft known tunes it ain't my style And this concludes our program of how N.W.A. makes a ruthless jam Now first we take an average drum Give it to Dre, and the boy gets dumb It's no secret, that I sit alone at night Pick up a pad and pen and begin to write all kinda lyrics that's promised to play to make everybody say: (They can be cold and ruthless no question about that, but sometimes it's more complicated...) [Eazy E:] Yo Dre (You know what I want you to do ?) [Public Enemy:] Bring that beat back, bring that beat back Now MC Ren is here workin like super glue No matter what I do, I'm always thinkin o' you Coz I'm the pusher, supplyin the fix And this jam's so dope, it don't need a remix But I'm makin obstacles of enemy traps to catch any MC's with the weak-ass raps Crucifyin their [?? huh ??] like just for usin my name The definition is pain, but that's the thing o' the game If they try to retreat, I catch'em one at a time coz they're comittin a crime, and still promotin a rhyme So, you're in the back of me just listen and learn because you'll all get a chance or maybe a turn Now my sideman wants to give a preview so at my next concert I wanna see you there not sittin in a chair standin on yo feet, with yo hand in the air Now I'm about to get out but I'll be back But next time expect the more funkier track deep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion with lyrics that's smooth to start some discussion The beat that I'm [?? hype ??] and you know that's bad Now continue to dance coz I'm thru with tha set, Amen. Shalom.}

{This is complete trash, WTF happen to EM The entire album is just TRASH}
{Eminem <3 :3}
{Royce's verse was just good old Royce. Big Sean.. God his voice annoys me. Danny killed his verse as usual. Eminem did well, that monotone voice with the quick syllable rhymes makes it a true Eminem style and it's what has come to be expected of him, but still not one of his best. But that chorus.. Oh my god the chorus.. Her voice makes me want to gouge my eardrums out with a fucking ice cream scoop.. I don't know whether Dej is auto tuned to sound like shit the way T-Pain is, or if she's legitimately tone deaf.}
{Eminem respect}
{R.I.P. good song: 0:00 - 3:40}

{2:12 did Big Sean just say 50 shades of grey? :O}
{Royce killed it!!}
{I liked all the verses in this song but Em's verse is my least favorite. He's been falling off a bit lately and all of you who say he is the best rapper alive haven't heard of any of the underrated rappers. Plenty of them are better than Em and they don't rap about the same shit in every song. And then there are those are hating on Danny Brown because of his voice and look. Listen to 25 Bucks and Grown Up and come back and say he's the worst rapper alive. It's funny how it's the people that are different that are hated on the most. Peace.  ✌️}

Supa Hot Fiya Eminem sucks because he doesn't rap about smoking, bitches, money, pussies, and cars. All he raps about is determination, his life struggles, having no fear, and about life.}

{Big Sean surprised me that was raw shit}
{This Big Sean got me liking him.}
{To people who talk about Oreo shits like white part is better,you must think that you eat  both white and black parts, you don't  eat white part only. Actually, I like Eminem, but he wasn't good in this song...}
{YES SLIM SHANDY}
{shit EminemVEVO's profile pic looks exactly the way this beat sounds. :(}
{Awesome}
{You are the best rapper ever :) }
{Dear those who are talking shit about Em, no on likes you. Saying shit like Eminem doesn't have good flow, or isn't the best rapper in this song, or that he ruined it, you're lucky the Shady fans can't get to you. Otherwise you would've been castrated with fishing knives. Em is the best rapper around, and I'm not just saying that. His lyrics are clever and are incomparable. He actually raps about real life and not just fucking bitches. His lyrics usually have a story and meaning behind it. He's also surpassed the speed of some of the fastest rappers around. Not only that, he raps so clearly, and the alliteration and his rhyme schemes are very well used. His rapid wordplay is incredible and no rapper could ever freestyle as well as him (hell no one wants to even face him in a rap battle because of his skills), MOST rappers have even stated that he is probably the best in the game. "Em definitely influenced a lot in my style. I don’t think nobody’s matching him now." -Kendrick Lamar. I have to say Eminem is the face of rap, along with Kendrick and J Cole. They are true rappers. PS Dej Loaf is a shit rapper.}
{umm.. I love eminem but his part sucks}
{I loved the first verse that dej loaf rapped}
{royce like a shit ;-;}
{trick trick just killed that shit! definitely one of the best doing it right now!}

{No one does it better. Lets go Em!}
{Royce had the best verse!}
{E-dubble is a great rapper along with eminem but eminem ain't the best rapper in the world I would say e-dubble is much better he is a small rapper but he is great !!}
{Eminem needed swear words in order to make rhymes, and the swear words didn't even fit in. Definitely not his best work, sorry to say.}
{"Before Jaydee was j dilla" hard af}
{Okay, I thought Em's flow was off. But after hearing it a few times, I realize that he jus damn near suffocates it. He attacks the beat, but it still breathes. Hearing it go out and come back in while he spits rapid-fire is just amazing. Best technical emcee for sure}
{Detroit!}
{He's great man!}
{Detroit is the best city ever with probably the best artists coming out of it!! This song shows just a few of the great artists out if Detroit!! And Eminem's part is amazing and do is big Sean's!!! Those two were the best ones!!! GO DETROIT #DETROITVSEVERYBODY}
{omg:)(L) love}
{That Adrian Peterson reference gets me every time I listen to Em's verse 😂}
{That flow}
{I love Eminem..he is my favorite rapper..but Royce took this one}
{Sick man}
{Goddamn Em can still murder shit, he just needs a beat that isn't low energy poppy bullshite like this..}
{Im from Grand Rapids showing love for our big brother to the east Detroit. Much love hope to see you blossom again <3 Im praying you}
{It's hard to go on eminem videos cause of all the fans. He's good and one of the best but goddamn he's overrated the way you guys put him out there. To be honest Royce always seems to beat eminem on his own tracks. Where's his fan base?}
{Danny Brown!!!}
{Sean was too damn long and Danny was too damn short}
{Who else thought big sean looked like dave chapell? With the crack dance and everything. Respect though}
{Eminem, let Danny Brown money on teeth that he, as a homeless person. Again for food, he was forced to work}
{LOVE IT!!}
{Does Trick Trick run Detroit? I feel like he does.}
{i knew the second guy would say 50 shades of grey}
{yeah too bad proof wasn't alive, he would have killed it}
{can you all check my new song called ''material ambitions''}
{I'm a fan of Eminem and I don't wanna spam, but... I'm a Hip-Hop Artist from Flint Michigan, music's a big part of my life, and I'm just trying to get more people to hear me a little more. Check out a new song I posted on my channel, "Love Song" and some of my other songs! Thanks everyone!}

{Not the best i heard from him but still a good song to me and he still my favorite raper no madder what even when im 100 he would always be my favorite and i dont know why people dont like him most of my friends do but the truth is because people think their better than him but your not so stop being haters most people i actually know people that do also girls but most like with weed cus think there better than everybody and why do people hear his songs "if u dont like his songs shut up"}

{i guess i gotta stick to the older stuff...}
{Very good work}
{this is my favorite song it is so good.}
{Royce and Big Sean are both great in their own rights, but no one embodies the city of Detroit as well as Danny Brown. And as for Eminem, nothing needs to be said.}
{Get Rich Or Die Trying.... DID IT MADE IT !!!!!!}
{the only reason why i hear this song is because danny brown }
{Big sean is not on rhythm}
{danny brown looks like one of the hobos on drugs from the where I live... tho he cant rap as good as those hobos...}
{Dudes mad because they can't recite Eminems verse lol}
{Where obie at!}
{I like All of there parts... Well almost all. The way Danny brown was talking was confusing, and it was all because I couldn't understand a word he said. Although I did hear some of the words he said, and it was pretty clever and well said. Eminem's part was amazing, Big Sean's part was excellent, and Royce's part was well spoken and kind of spoke to me more than anyone. Danny Brown just bummed me out because I couldn't understand him.}

{I feel as if Eminem isn't comfortable when raping with others as if he doesn't let his feelings come out when he raps.}
{love....}
{i have you, i eat you :(}
{Big Sean is awesome. I love his style of rapping and his rhythm and tone may sound dull to some, but I think it's great. The others did pretty well too, though.}

{Am i the only one here who thinks royce da 5'9 looks liek the purple ninja turtle.}
{Who is the person singing the hook?}
{You guys don't know shit about how great ems verse actually was}
{Sean doesn't deserve this. I get it it's a Detroit song. But to be on a track with em Danny and Royce you have to be good at rapping. Def did a better job rapping in this song then Sean has his entire career. And she ain't even have a verse. Fire song tho. And love hearing em on his old flow.}
{in my eyes, all four from royce to em, fucking killed it!}

{Danny Brown just ruined the whole song -_-}
{Does anyone else think this song is missing street light?}
{Em killed it guys and so did Danny Brown}
{If Eminem decided that Danny Brown was à better choice over Obie Trice or any one of the members from D12 then he himself really has gone to shit. Danny Brown is just a mistake. We're still waiting for the "oops"}
{I dont actually know what Danny Brown is saying...}
{I love this song, but Big Sean and Em need to make a song together with no one else  :)}
{Proud of being STAN !}

{Eminem raps so fast. Must be a (rap) god.}
{living in my head rent free that's a dope line}
{I see a lot of people complaining in the comments that Em "changed". Of course he changed, hes in his 40's now. Hes not going to rap like hes 27 again. He's an artist, and artists dont keep re-painting the same picture over and over again. This is who he evolved into, and hes still dope! Be happy that we have someone who loves the craft, is a great lyricist, and rhymes about real shit still. We shouldnt be complaining when you see so much dumbed down garbage around. - If anyone's just chillin out on youtube for a bit and wants to check some true meaningful hip hop, check me out and let me know what you think.

{I'd rather hear a "worse" rapper who gives life to the track and makes it bounce, than hear the "better" rapper show off in his monotone destroying any chance of listening pleasure. Today's best music is coming out of Atlanta because it's more... musical.}

{I love how much people are hating on Eminem here. He is easily one of the best rappers ever, saying otherwise is just ignorant. Riding all the underground artist's dicks is prolly on of the most hipster things I've seen. YES, there are some amazing underground artists, but Eminem is trying to bring the art form of rapping to the mainstream. He is a fantastic wordsmith and saying otherwise is silly.}

{SO BEAST}
{Great song YouTube is just a bitch thow}

{Detroit 4EVER !!!!}
{Eminem killed this it should detroit vs eminem fr}
{Ari😞❤️}
{an ole man once told me holding a grudge is like letting a niggah live in your head rent free (barsssssssssssssssssss)}
{OK fuck what I said before this song is dope as fuck I just had to give it some time to grow on me. But still that auto tune shit ruined this song and EMINEM will always be the greatest of all time but he's getting old he is already forty two. And this year he will be forty three he is just not the same as he used to be.}
{Turkeyyy !!!! <3}
{Can anyone rap as good as Em?}
{I swear to god eminem has the most annoying fuckin fan base ever. All these great artists (except for dej loaf) and all I see in the comments is "eminemenemenmenemenemenem"!}
{check me out on soundcloud www.soundcloud.com/lunatic323}
{I just fast forwarded to em's verse after Royce and Sean. I wasn't let down :) feel like he killed it.}
{Check it out you won't regret it}

{какую диабло ти прошол обичную или с дополнением про ангела смерти  }
{Big sean topped even em on this lyrically. Em had the best flow but wow}
{Eminem get off Tech N9ne's nuts!}
{"My homie wanted a chevy, so i put my dog in the vet" I don't get it ??}
{Hopsin}
{Royce got that shit on lock🎤🎶🎶}
{Free Theo Tonin}
{eminem is so adorable. i want to hug him and be engulfed into his big jacket and never let go of him while i take his hat and hood off of his head and feel his hair and his face.}
{An he shall see shells but not by the sea shore...that shit was fire}
{All the bad comments dumb ya probly rewind it to hear it again}
{I want my birth paper to say im form Detroit}
{Don't know why y'all are hating on Em's verse. I thought it was dope.}
{Not really a fan.. But Danny Brown killed this shit!}
{Should've gotten the beat done by a Detroit producer as well (Black Milk? even an old Dilla gem in the vaults). Then added 2 more verses for Elzhi and Obie Trice :)}
{Dude on the movie was all you actually gay}
{Deeetroit!!! Defend the Den @ all cost!!! Did u get permission from the gangsters b4 entering the city!!}
{Eminem is the best}
{Why are there Russian comments coming to this video?}
{Rip big proof}
{How can you people say a certain rapper ruined the song they are all rapping about their individual lives and what they went through listen before you speak.}
{I had a burning desire to climb that fucking ladder.}
{I hate em when he makes his lyrics to complicated and fast his best lyrics like stan are not complex and fast.}
{All of them are killing it !!}
{big sean killed it}
{Royce and Em brought it like always. but Big Sean surprised me and came hard. tbh I was expecting more from danny :/ I feel he didn't give it his all. but anyway they did great}
{Royce da 5'9"}
{Eminem king !}
{did anybody hav difficulty hearing the 3rd rapper....he reminds me of ODB, but he's..........}
{Tupac}
{Where's Isaiah Rashad on this?}
{The song was trash exept eminem' verse it was epic as always i don't think that eminem lost his skills i think that his age made him lose the will to rap he is 43 what do you expect more than this anyway he is still dope and the best in the  industry way better than iggy and lil wayne young thug you can see the superiorite of marshall}
{AWESOME just AWESOME}
{Danny Brown Sounds As Crazy As He Looks Lol. Big Sean Was Ehhhh....}
{the 2.58 verse is hideous}
{EMINEM THE BEST}
{2 fucking hours awaiting eminem during this song.}
{Sic track homies}
{you're best !!!!!! jaaannnn !!!!!}
{Da 5"9? Lol}
{Em go real hard on this bitch. He got such crazy bars. Prodigy.}
{all i heard in em's part was "2 penises"}
{Why does everybody hate Danny Brown he's a good rapper though. :/}
{Em shit/hit list.....  Bobby shmurda Chief queef Future Birdman Young thug Bitch hommie quan  AND THE LIST GOES ON.. HIP HOP IS DYING BUT NOT DEAD}
{Em sick jus wish he had enough guts to tell half these wack ass cats in the mainstream industry they garbage. Sucks hes white cuz thats all thats holdin him back}
{Am I witnessing the rebirth of #HIPHOP ??????? Sure sounds and looks so, feel this d vs everybody !!!!!!!}

{Love the cry for help on the hat.}
{Free Theo Tonin}
{My teacher taught him and my other one was like his thing to this thing I forgot but this guy in my class his mom used to go to the same school as him}
{This... is so dope.}
{Detroit is falling apart i used to live by Detroit and it was really bad one day it will build up again}
{Why does this song have so few views? This is such a good song Royce, Big Sean and Danny Brown are awesome in this. Eminem's part was probably the least interesting which is a nice change.}
{why does some random hobo come out of nowhere and start singing at 3:00}
{I see a lot of people complaining in the comments that Em "changed". Of course he changed, hes in his 40's now. Hes not going to rap like hes 27 again. He's anartist, and artists dont keep re-painting the same picture over and over again. This is who he evolved into, and hes still dope! Be happy that we have someone who loves the craft, is a great lyricist, and rhymes about real shit still. We shouldnt be complaining when you see so much dumbed down garbage around. - If anyone's just chillin out on youtube for a bit and wants to check some true meaningful hip hop, check me out and let me know what you think. Not trying to spam like everyone does tho, just sayin if your relaxing sittin back looking for something to do, check it out in my channel!﻿}
{Fuck Adrian Peterson!! 4:15}
{#BigSeansCloset}
{I don't understand why most people in these comments are dissing big sean and danny brown.  All i see is eminem made this song. I am an eminem fan, and i love his music, but you guys need to give big sean and danny brown some credit.}
{Noone likes Danny brown}
{yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh cacho rap me encanta eminem a tope}

{Detroit  vs. Everybody😀😀😇yayy # detroit  #imfromthere}
{Epic song}
{Em is still the shit. True Legend of Rap. All the greats are dead except for him what we going to be left with when Eminem leaves?}
{#Eminem  #perfect  #Turkey İn İzmir come ;) }
{Who the fuck killed the real slim shady}
{EMINEM round is the best ;)}
{Best rappers  1. Slim Shady  2. EMINEM 3. Marshall Mathers 4. B-rabbit  5. White guy from D12 6. White part of Bad Meets Evil 7. King of underground}
{Eminem is my life i know like every song off by heart}
{dobrepolje vs everybody}
{Shout out from DUBAI }
{313 all day}
{Only ones that were good was Royce and Em!!!}
{This was good....Big Sean is rapidly improving!!!}
{big sean la mejor parte <3 :3 }
{What happened to danny brown he looks so different now compared to two years ago}
{lol those who say Eminem is washed up are fools. Regardless of age or generation, when a man has something to say that matters, it has impact. And that's the difference between Rapper A B C D and Shady. Shady's got something to say, what's rapper A got to say, he's got fat rims? What's rapper B got to say? Conspiracy this, truth that? How would rapper B know what the 'Truth' is? What's C got to say? He'll kill ya cause he's gangster ghetto and jack your car? D talks about taking all the women in the club because he's to smooth. Eminem talks about all that and adds some crazy, mixed with a much needed dose of intelligence. Then inject something you can feel. As long as he can deliver something you can feel on top of everything else, Slim will stay on top, from age 24 to death.}
{3:38 slim shady where have you been?}
{Eminem just murdereddddd this }
{eminem killed it }
{This is awesome don't forget it's not a song it's a freestyle! Why would u want eminem going back to all his old stuff?? When all his new stuff are so much better!! One thing.I love about eminem his that!  he doesn't rap about bitches using the word nigga or any rasicem words!  his music about his life where he came from nothing now he's some thing? Eminem as.change a lot of people life since hes.done music! What have the other rapper done?  what every one done fuck all part from.brought.crime an gangs least eminem made some thing of his life! Just staying init}
{Fuck big Sean the song was going good for me until his verse came in wtf😡}
{em sucked in this one}
{danny brown killed every body}
{why u wanna stay in detroit fuck DETROIT  its already ghetoo and ruined  dej loaf can get buttfucked tho}
{Sean had the hardest verse}
{detroit vs evrybody}
{Danielle Bussey the same time as well as the name of the New song}
{Song starts at 3:40. You're welcome}
{You wanna help us boy}
{Eminem is the best and before i get haters comments let me post this question. Why are you watching an eminem song? Nuff said Favorite album:relapse}
{FUCK DETROIT NIGGA  WEST COAST NIGGA}
{You know why eminem is so great ..it's because he says what he thinks and he's not afraid what other people are gonna say or do because when yu live yur life. Live it like yu have no limit so all dem haters shut yur fucking mouth and hop along fucking bunch of pussyos who suck their mum all day}
{Just perfect}

{3:39}
{LOVE Marhsall's part!}
{Eminem is the best , higher level what exist ! ;)}
{EM fuck me brother there is nobody alive that can put that shit down like you can.  Everytime I hear you, every piece of new material you put out I am amazed . I can hardly think as fast as you can rap.   EM bottom line if you are not in the industry when you were rap would not be as powerful as it is today......}
{Eminem is great but I listen to 3Pac, M&Ms, 3 Chainz, Big Wayne, Small Sean, 60 Cent, Snoop Catt, Mr. Dre, Ice Cubed, Old Jeezy, Jay-Y, Soulja Girl, Jizz Khalifa, Anna Kendrick Lamar, Hard-E, Andre 2999, Big B, Weak Mill, Semi-Automatic Kelly, Adult Cudi, Wu-Tang Tag Team, KRS-Two, Obie Twice, Prada Mane, DMX Bike, and Kanye East instead.}
{Well. In all opinion. Eminem wins😊😊😊}
{Although this is hard, had they done a cypher in a different light it would have brought them a lot more attention}
{#salute   #detroitvseverybody   #hitmantv  #therealDJviciousVic}
{Big Sean probably did the best here out of his entire career.}
{Eminem Best}
{Sean is good I see hope in him MAY BE}
{i gotta give it too them.. pure skill raw lyrics.. respects detroite! respect one world!! (313) (604/778/250/) (413) (213) (403) CANADA WHAT! EAST VAN WHAT!! WHAT UP!! ONE LOVE!

{if u love usa check my new song out called dont hate my flag}
{its so shit !!!}
{3:39}

{People are always gonna hate on the best.}
{Eminem is the best rapper alive, believe or not.}
{NOBODY CARES WHO HAD THE BEST VERSE!!!!!!!! JUST ENJOY THE FUCKING MUSIC}
{use this song}
{2:53 - 2:54 LOOK AT THEM LEGS}
{Detroit'in tek başına ne kadar kaliteli olduğunu göstermek istemiş sanırım. Başarmış da. Kadro çok iyi seçilmiş, hele Loaf nakarata tam uymuş. Fazlasıyla kaliteli bi' çalışma olmuş helal olsun, beklenenin çok üstünde.}
{Девушка, поющая в начале, на Лепса похожа}
{that hook was weak}
{Sean's verse was dope}
{I always thought the girl was skylar Grey}
{Dej Loaf's voice had me like.....what?}
{}
{Man, watching this back just smacked me in the face and reminded me how much Em got me through, living in a place like that where its grey and cold and miserable and you feel like you have no way out...I remember sobbing in my car when 'Beautiful' came on the radio the first time, it was like a sign. Eminem's music truly saved my life when I was there, I can't believe I ever forgot.}
{Big Sean's Detroit references in his verse were fucking crazy. "My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in a vet" "I'm the D can't no offense dunk on me, I'm Mr. Big Shot these hoes getting drunk off me"}
{They all killed it. Definitely shows Detroit love.}
{Nobody,Eminem coolest}
{有中文歌詞嗎?}
{FINALLY...................}
{Big Sean flow is crazy but he needs to change his tone it's too layback}
{Dose the Detroit pistons count as Detroit vs everybody}
{I'm on y'all team}
{Eminem is the best}
{This is rap.}
{12 million view ! That's a little for a good song}
{The hook ruins this song}
{omG Eminem why ?}
{This song is a banger!! Im glad its a single}
{I'm not a Sean fan but he killed it}
{dz dz dz dz dz zz magari shedevriiia . sagol !!}
{this song is like an OREO all we like is the white part !! ( i'm not a racist) :)}
{I hoped this would spark remixes in all the other city's. Example. New York vs everybody, ATL vs everybody, Chicago vs everybody, Compton vs everybody etc...}
{People only say that eminem is not a good raper these days because most are sagers and they like to her about weed drugs and more and like eminem doesn't rap like that people wont like him for his music}
{Estalin ovalles}
{defalarca dınleyebılecgım bı sarkı :D}
{I see a lot of people complaining in the comments that Em "changed". Of course he changed, hes in his 40's now. Hes not going to rap like hes 27 again.

{cade os br nessa porra lol}

{Thanks Danny Brown for ruining this song...}
{FLorin Salam the best =)))))))))))))}
{hOLY SHIT  I hate Dej Loafs voice !!!!}
{i always get the the chills when i listen to eminems music....its just sooo AMAZING !!!}
{people are stupid for having there own opinions}
{Em should go back to his Relapse flow}
{mader fakers}
{This is the eminem i like}
{i aint really too big on Sean lately but dat nigga jus BLACKED TF OUT ONE TIME!!}
{B SEAN DON}
{Who's the fuck wit that is just talking in this song instead of actually having a flow?}
{CHEKC OUT MY MIXTAPE THANX EVERYONE support underground music}
{Someone didn't hit puberty ovbiously}
{Em inspired me and so many others not only is he a RAP GOD!! He's the reason I have I smile day to day!!!!}
{Dope}
{I personally think that Royce and Danny brown has the best parts tbh}
{I'm not even american but DETROIT WHAT!}
{i love  it but i dont know why !!!}
{"Shady's still a lady killer since the day that I went insane and then attacked the babysitter with a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center."}
{ZULUF}
{Em for Detroit Mayor!}
{good topic! :)}
{Eminem vs Everybody}
{See some people don't obviously know anything about Hip hop because you would know that Eminems verse spit raw. My opinion he's the best. You haters hate him because he's white or he's better than your favorite rapper.}
{so are you slim or em? cos one moment you're rapping about how your life was a movie, and then your talking about slashing a baby sitters throat  how do you people let this shit slide?}
{allllllway the best}

{Im sorry, but can someone put the rappers in order of appearance please?}

{Trash}
{I saw the behind the scenes this was sick.}
{Ohhhhhhh .. the song is good but without  Danny Brown  PLZ :(}
{eminem is the king of kings he is the biggest raper in the world}
{You know a song is good when the other rappers out shine Em, he did great but these guys did so well as well.}
{could they not get a better beat for these guys jeez}
{Only Eminem and one of the black guys (I don't know his name) were good in this song. Without them this song would be crap}
{Guys i'm the real Eminem !!﻿}
{Yo. This song is sick.  They went hard in the paint son.}
{Em takin shots at Adrian Peterson}
{#eminemisthebestrapperevercomeatme}
{B.i.g. sean don}
{I like M&M's.}
{Why the FUCK is Eminem famous? His music is so pathetic and terrible yet people still take him seriously?!?! He's a douchebag and a fraud. }
{I love this song!!}
{Royce bodies Eminem on every track they do}
{I remember back when I first hear big sean on Wiz's track, phone numbers. He was terrible. But now he is spitting with the best of them.}
{Fastforwarding through all the cracrays... Only M seems to spit the shit. }
{Loved all of it apart from the guy in middle with the dreads}
{the beat is boring kinda ruined the whole song}
{I Am not from Detroit, but this is  #DOPE   #Detroitvseverybody  }
{Guyz y'all shd checkout dis song , #OJUELEGBA BY #WIZKID... stuff is preety damn kul}
{Errbody is dope on this shit Eminem is one of the greatest no doubt but it's strange that i force myself to understand that old school rap of his never been a fan of that style i know it's dope but just i can't relate much to that like i related to everyone of his songs back in the day ! I think he makes shit too complicated and too fast nowadays and it's strange to me but it is what it is he can rap how he want to i still bump this shit but i think i related more to Vegas and Psychopath Killer songs like that !! Still Eminem forever respect for Detroit !}
{PLZ MAKE SONGS LIKE THIS. WE R TIRED OF NEW FAKE RAPPERS}
{danny browns hair doe}
{This sucks! I hate when Eminem puts these shitty untalented wanna be rappers in his songs.}
{Big Sean just murdered his verse. Every one else was great especially Eminem but Big Sean just killed it.}
{What is the girl at the start}
{eminem carry on}
{This album was kind of a let down for me, I mean I liked some of the songs but I couldn't listen to all of them.... ;/}
{big sean was in this song?}
{More like Eminem vs the world}
{Super thoed mane !! Check out Machine on YouTube under Machine915highbreed the most intelligent persistent Mexican!! Texas}
{Is there any one else here to hear this part 03:38 - 05:18 ??}
{Very good.}
{Danny brown! Why do you have to ruin this song.}
{Big Sean and EM had the best Verses. Others not so much and the Hook was actually very bad...}
{I like how when Eminem said "Or Lorena with 2 penises" they showed 2 hotdogs ready xD}
{Eminem fan pack for sale!}
{That big sean is so bad hahaha! just cut him out..}
{Top 5 wrappers 1. Snickers  2. Plastic wrap 3. The guy at Taco Bell 4. Lollipop wrappers 5. ps4/Xbox game wrappers}
{I don't care for some of these new collaboration tracks. I remember when I was younger and would buy albums, and usually always listen to the tracks that featured other top rappers. But there were usually only a few on each album, so it was like a treat to listen to it. But now, all the videos, all the albums- they're all collaborations. Every possible combination of rapper (and pop star for that matter) is out there- often multiple times. Some of them I like don't get me wrong, but it's just you don't see a lot of albums where a rapper is spitting 80% of it. I still love some of the old collabs; Reservoir Dogs, Young G's (Diddy or not- it's good stuff), World War 3, and my fave Fantastic Four.}
{Royce killed it}
{Who is this "Girl" ?}
{Royce snapped,  big Sean was ok,  but stale and repetitive,  couldn't really understand Danny brown, em snapped.}
{this is too much🙏omg i love it,like the best rappers all together finially👊}
{fuck all you haters eminem is one of the greatest rappers ever so fuck u👋his one of the only celebs that has actually not let fame get to him and is still real coz tbh most celebs dont no what to do with their money and they let fame go to their head and become stuck up pricks but has eminem... no 🙏}
{EMINEM KILLED IT, ROOOLF!}
{Эминем рулит!}
{Danny Brown you suck like shit and youre voice is an old guys voice just disgusting but all of the others are just awesome nice job to everybody but Danny Brown}
{Big Sean tho o_O Mans is growing exponentially........can't wait to see what level he's on 10 years from now}
{The beat was murdered so many times you can call it Krillin. Lmao}
{Eminem just totally kills everything ever in this one track. Flow and lyricism is just incredible}
{Sean shit on this shit}
{ok look, the only reason this is dope is because of Eminem and Big sean, dej loaf has ONE SONG, Royce isn't bad but who gives a shit for him, and danny brown is just a mainstream tech nine. the same way they did this is the same way new York could have done, Brooklyn vs everybody, harlem vs everybody, Bronx, queens, etc etc. and not to forget the west coast or the south. but key word is EMINEM}

{I have a solution for those who want old Em back and who don't like the new him.---------------------------> Don't fucking listen to him!!! Just because you don't like his new style, doesn't mean that he sucks. You don't understand his message thats all!. Obviously he's not going to rap like 15 years ago.. He grow up. That's life. In fact he's one of the best rappers of all time. For many ones the rap god<3}

{Кто хочет, чтобы Eminem приехал в Россию, поддержите пальцами вверх!!!!}
{Eminem didn't get so hyped because he is white, there is 1000 Of good white rappers, and most of them have gotten no where. Eminem got to the hype that he has, because he really open for his emotions.That combined wite the fact that his skille lvl is crazy high!}

{5:48 Big Proof R.I.P.}
{Last verse <3}
{Danny brown is💩💩💩💩💩}
{I like some other comment in other video by Eminem or by someone else how he or she is like "You don't eat just the white part or just the black part of the oreo. You eat the whole damn thing because if you just eat the black part or the white part only you're going to be like " ' Wait I feel like something is missing ' "}

{Detroit vs 5K dislikes lol}
{eminem is true that you come to Brazil ? if true thank you , I'm your fan and you the best singer in the world RIO DE JANEIRO}
{Eminem had more time and a era full of technology when he was comin up and had a hip hop legend co sign. So it's safe to say he had a bit of advantage over biggie and pax. Make no mistakes, even eminem knows if biggie and pac were still alive he would have a damn hard time get number rapper spot. So enjoy the music and leave the legends out of it.}
{I know what Danny Brown wants for Christmas; his two front teeth.}
{wheres Trick Trick?}
{eminem good topics that I love sos genius rapper groso}
{I actually like Danny Brown's voice it's so odd and different.}

{J. Cole Should Have Featured In This...}
{Eminem you need to make songs like you used to like loose your self, till I collapse, Stan and the way I am plz dude your better than this!!!!!}

{WTF is the last verse??? Ruins it for me}
{All respect to em... But Sean made it.}

{hey man all yous are best}
{Duh slow down}
{WTF is happening to rap!? Eminem has been out of da streets for too long}
{What about any new song with 50 cent also em you should check out asap rocky}
{Other 3rd verse is shit}
{Lots of people hating Eminem for what reason has he done anything to your life}
{This is by far eminems best rap on his knew album, love his flow... since relapse album he has just been getting better}
{Haven't really kept up with Eminem's newer stuff aside from Bad Meets Evil, I really didn't feel his anger fueled delivery. He was much better on his first two albums. This video was pretty on point. I'm going to have to check the new album. I was even impressed by Big Sean's verses. While lackluster they were better than his usually delivery.}
{This song is great! Dej Loaf Chorus: awesome Royce's Verse: Really awesome! Big Sean's Verse: better than royce Danny Brown Verse: Good verse but it's hard to understand him Eminem verse: Legendary shit here woah... Trick Trick: he didn't do anything in this song lol}

{This song is hot. No arguments from me or long winded explanation. Makes me not hate my city. Detroit!!!}
{все эти замашки рэперские - это такой пиздец }
{Get dat remix trickn soon}
{Tbh Big Sean's verse made this song good, rest were average.}
{Still Detroit Men}
{this track remind me of old school, beat-ful and lyrical...}
{Il flow di  #eminem  è ineguagliabile. Rimane lui, per distacco, il miglior rapper esistente!}
{Девушка так смешно ,ноги матает,ахаехх}
{NICEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!}
{I made it to mainstream an still never abc this shit. True. Unlike any other mainstream rapper lool}
{If it wasn't evident before, eminem has basically offically "softened" up. I don't mean he isn't good anymore, not by a longshot. But definitely toned down from Slim Shady and MMLP 1 }
{I'm a Eminem fan but he should just do the whole song himself! The rest are feeble compared to the lyrical God! Good song just wish it was Eminem himself tho}
{Dudes be hating on eminems fans, i got some news Em gives 0 shits about your feed back so fuck yall haters! check out Witt Lowry!}
{Dej Loaf sound like a teen boy, and can someone tell me what was the point of trick trick being in this, his part was pointless.}

{Ocean Pierce Duuuuuuuuuuddddddde!!!!!!!!}
{The song starts at 3:39}
{Awesome track}
{yes i agree asa jake}
{Keep going Eminem , that's how we love your music }
{More like Detroit vs. poverty, crime, unemployment, debt, and terrible sports teams. Detroit is the worst place to live in the United States.}
{Just leave the haters alone. They just cant appreciate what people do in order to become successful. And if ppl think that eminem sucks ass... his ratings and fame differ}
{Em's like fine wine gets better with time. Sticking with him till the end.}
{This song´s remeber me 8 MILEE <3}
{The Chorus sounds like an auto tuned pubescent boy...}
{Raaaa Sean went in!!}
{they knew dej loaf was wack so they put her as chorus lol.}
{Big Sean I like eminent nut everybody else made it suck except big sean}
{I believe there can't be a best artist because not everyone is going to like him/her but they can be one of the best}
{eminem got the best beat and his voice is calm unlike danny brown em sounds awesome}
{why complain about the best rapper which is just an opinion my fav rapper is Lil Wayne but, tbh I love errybody who tryna come up and shoutout to all the legends we all have fans lol =) (=}
{Eminem,Big Sean, and Royce Da 5'9 all had good lyrics but tbh i didint really like Danny Browns line}
{Eminem is sick on this track... He's the one that made this pop...}
{Dope}
{Eminem sucked in this one, fans need to just say the truth, I literally couldn't tell what's he saying, but nice flow.}
{Greatest rapper of this time}
{Marshall is getting better everyday!!!!!!! his voice it Amazing keep it on !!!!}
{eminem has probably spoke more than any other human in this world has ever spoke. EVER! imagine, if he can spit his whole life story in just 3 minutes imagine what he's been saying over the course of his life :O... cray!}
{Eminem- still the best :)}

{See you in the hell, fuckers!!!}
{Why are these comments on who's the best rapper?    Man I clicked on this song to represent Detroit. I like all of them because they're putting out for the city!}
{amo de +++++++}
{Be jamming out and then dej loaf's verse comes on and I suddenly want to shut it off. Honestly one of the most annoying rappers I've heard in my life}
{}
{Everyone just SHUUUUUTT UP and enjoy the song thank you :)}
{Royce's verse was by far the best. How is this even a question? Eminem's verse is intricate as fuck, yes, but most of it sounds like nonsense. So many forced rhymes... Royce's voice and flow has been on point for almost 20 years and is still on top of the game. He kills Eminem on lots of songs on their BME album and in the song Scary Movie.}
{You are so so so Rap God !}
{Its a good song but nothing I want to play over and over or bang while cruising.}
{should have been called big sean vs everybody cuz he went to hard }
{🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉}
{Sorry but Royce 5'9 has officially grown to have the best flow in the game. It's fucking ridiculous, nobody else could've opened this track with such high expectations.}
{You squirrel on your city??}
{This song would be perfect if dej loaf wasn't in it}
{who the hell thought danny brown was good his voice makes me want to punch something}
{This song is so fucking amazing, although it could be because i'm crossfaded and on xans. I will be very disappointed if this song is bad when im sober.}
{who's the first singer on this song? }
{Whoever that chick was ruined this song if it even was a chick}
{Good to see the boyz from back in the day back into to the tunes of the old days. Reminds me of the time when there was real hip hop/rap.}
{I want to join Detroit. 100000000000000000%}
{Love this shit}
{DejLoaf is the song.}
{Big Sean your drunk.}
{Thy see me they salute me they ain't ready they ain't ready for that static #DetroitvsEverybody}
{will it make it?}
{Comment if u didn't understand anything danny brown said}
{BOOOOOOOMM EMINEM EMINEM EMINEM ! I'M HAPPY TO SEE HIM WITH DATS RAPPER ! (I'm a fucking frenchie)}
{damn this a good song lol soo addicting}
{EMINEM IS A GENIUS...}
{Proof Obama is part of a conspiracy to destroy America: A White House petition on their "We the People" page only needed 100,000 votes for Obama to take action to give Justin Beiber the boot back to Canada. 273,968 votes and Obama has done nothing. Obama would rather commit an impeachable act jeopardizing the sanctity, safety and sanity of the American public by allowing the presence of that egomaniacal, inexcusable and despicable douchebag than to kick that garbage back across the Canadian border where it belongs. Shame on you, Obama.﻿}
{if im eminem, im a little frustrated. hes so sick when it comes to technical ability, and he was pretty much top dawg in his prime, but dude just cant find that sweet spot anymore. i honestly cant even say what hes missing but whatever it is, i hope he finds it again}
{peace of shit}
{Let a n**** try me}
{Em the best writer and spitter in the game. Don't get it twisted,I ain't an eminem dickrider.my fave mcs are ghostface and mf doom.but I love hiphop and recognise talent and skills. Em is at the top of his game and continues to get better and still gets hated on,overlooked and underrated.he's one of the greatest of all times and the day that he dies he will be legendary status like most of the other artists who've passed away and never deserved it.appreciate him now why he still here.}
{See 2Pac 5:48}
{"That's none of my business but I don't sip tea" I love royce so much}
{eminem needs to get city 270 on tha track for real dude be strait killing it on the mic}
{Eminem RULES!}
{i didn't understand shit with em }
{ALL THESE SINGERS SOUND AN LOOK LIKE THEIR FROM SESAME STREET}
{I wish the Fat Killahz, D12, and King Gordy was in this King Gordy was the guy with the braided horns in 8 mile during the radio scene where rabbiy walked in on his girl}
{Big Sean had the best verse...but overall the track was trash...}
{Kinda over Em's forced metaphors at this point. I mean, there's no questioning the dude is a beast and easily one of the most influential MC's (for better or worse) EVER. Just, I dunno. I'm tired of him not rapping like he's comfortable - Danny sounds so comfortable when he raps because he just goes and it feels natural (to me), but Em sounds like he's just trying to smash through the damn thing and forcing too many words and "clever" lines into too little. Like he still seriously trying to prove himself, but the harder he tries the less impressed I am. Which doesn't matter a fucking wink, I ain't shit and this dude has more money and influence than I ever well, but still. I'd like to hear some raw Em again. Just my opinion, though.}
{Danny brown ruined it}
{Royce is really good though.}
{like if agree}
{best rapper ever}
{Eminem}
{Eminem & Royce da 5'9" (Tops), Big Sean could go harder.... Danny Brown..(WTF!!!).  Maybe Eminem could of put Obie Trice on this song in place of Danny Brown. Hope Obie Trice can go back to Shady records........}
{Danny Brown str8 killed it}
{Grande!}
{If any of you guys notice eminem even says that the albums he made while he was on drugs were not his best and he didnt like them and he says he aint ever going back to making those type of songs and i think he also said that he aint making songs involving his alter ego Slim Shady because those albums were not his best!!And in not afraid he says relapse was meh and he aint ever going back to that!!}
{shit sounds dated. they should have made this 10 years ago}
{Eminem has an amazing voice, so do you! He has talent, so do you! He has dreams, so do you! He is amazing and so are you! He is beautiful and so are you! Have an amazing day!﻿}
{Ems verse id the best}
{what did em say?}
{eminem said to bu}
{eminem rocks.... respect man}
{I think his best album was infinite, but the production of his latest tracks has become quite shit IMO! I don't like the whole guitar rock ballad shit he tends to mix with his bars, he is selling to a completely different crowed to when he first started off though, and he's gained the title rap GOD. And I say it's true, no one wants to exchange bars with him as long as it's featuring. And his fan base.... Yeah somewhat on some god shit.}
{Search "Novah James On Me" Eminem Is Defiantly A Legend But Novah James Is The FUTURE Thumbs Up If I Didn't Lie. ﻿}
{Em has always first pick since day one his intelligence with pick words in a ways no one as done it i love this video and i tip my hat off you are an inspiration to me  }
{song gets ruined at 2.58 :(}
{Emeniem ruined the song}
{Eminem didnt fell off! Its just that his way of rapping got so far ahead from Any other rapper that no one is able to comprehend it!}
{off topic of this bumpin song, but what kind of boots is em wearing lol? trucking luv them haha. lol i love danny browns verse}
{for everyone who thinks Biggie and Tupac are better than Eminem they are wrong for this one reason those dudes did not have a long career RIP maybe if they lived a little longer they would have been better but they didn't...}
{}
{Bruh... Sean murdered this shit}
{How come Elzhi wasn't on this song?  He would've murdered everyone}

{watch my vine pls thx}
{The hate comments coming from Nicki Minaj  fans LMAO. Eminem, 50cent and Drake are the best performing hip hop artists right now. The hate is coming from people who don't know shit about rap, they think they know things about rap just because they listened to Tupac Shakur (2pac)or Christopher Wallace (Notorious B.I.G) but they don't. Please don't chat shit if you know nothing about hip hop. Just shut the fuck up or fuck off if you are hating.}

It's just the rap guys don't take it to seriously he doesn't deserve hate all he has done for me is help I may not know him but I feel like I do. He helps ALOT of people u just don't even know. He is an amazing rapper the only person I actually listen to. I can pretty much sing all of his songs by heart. He is an amazing person and just because he raps the way he does doesn't mean it is towards u. He makes this for us to listen to even if he wasn't famous I'd be listening and I think some more of u would to. So if u don't like his badass raps then fuck off and stop hating guys just don't watch or listen. Ur just wasting ur life hating on people.}

{My name is mini I have fought rap battles since 15 and never lost one I have neen working on a 8 minute demo and rhymed the impossible I have spat 11r words in 15 seconds  If any of you are into hard offencive lyrics then the mini Ep will be going up on 30 of June 2015 all i'm asking is a quuick listen and some feed Back just give me one minute of you're time is all i'm asking how can you expect to hear a mans potential if you don't give him a chance 30 of June thank you}
{em....goat}
{Special thanks to the director and cast that made possible that this video out stand. Good work! From the lyrics, to the artist that perform in this video; you have a five star with a thumb up. To those artistic artist which I don't know yet: Good job! To Marshall Mather: you really feel proud of Detroit. And not only that, part of it.  Keep the projects and expectations up.  Not your fan, but your friend.  Melecio}
{I hope your day has been absolutely incredible! don't stress to much and never give up on your dreams!! Never be afraid to be YOU!﻿}
{Ems fans are the most annoying in the world. Period. He ain't even hip hop anymore, he's hip pop that why y'all know bout him. Danny brown the only true mc on the track. Those going on about his lyrics he's average, listen to Joey badass kendrick lamar lupe childish gambino common etc}
{Danny browns very was the hardest. Don't bother replying and lickin ems verse, he's irrelevant}
{Eminem Comment section 1) Eminem is a god of all rap he is an inspiration 2) SCREWWW ALLL THE HATERS 3) insert troll comment here 4) this guy will slaughter tupac and biggie at the same time. 5) Eminem is not good anymore like he use to}
{nice song :) im trying to make rap too and its not going well cant get any views :( please check my channel out . thanks }
{This might just be me, but I think Eminems verse here is better than the Rap God. The entire song.}
{I don't think anyone's mentioned this but I would like to point out that I, and probably many others, am glad that vevo didn't censor this as they usually censor Eminem's lyrics}
{Best song !!}
{Not even Eminem could save this song.}
{Уж больно ущербно эта шайка выглядит(Eminem,конечно же,не в счет).}
{Y'all sittin here arguing on who did better on the track.. Thats besides the point. They made this track to rep the D! Not to try to outshine one another... Smh.}
{He has shaped who I am today.}
{I think this song is my shit}
{It may even seem as if...I'm yanking your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm saying shit is playing with your relations changing its still the same shit and Shady still a lady killer since the day he went insane and attacked the babysitter with a potato piller and mash the face of the entertainment center. Looks like another plane just landed straight into Ukraine again or the Bermuda Triangle attempting to make a safe descent awaiting anyone who aint affiliated it could be danger.}
{Nce :D}
{Can anyone see what jacket Em is wearing?}
{The person after Big Sean sucks major ass}
{Em is still out in the game but he's not really aiming to go public; once in a while, his song will be on the radio. I've read few articles that he stated he wants to leave the spotlight to spend more time with his family while his daughter (Hailey) is going to college.}
{What the fuck is this shit?}
{Eminem the best:)}
{oh fack..}
{Love eminem}
{Hi is the god of rap}
{Lol, like an Oreo The white part is the best}
{damn}
{eminem is the best of all !!!}
{not only good !!! very good :P !!!!}
{"Bxtch i'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me. I'm the big shot, these hoes get drunk off me." Big Sean is nasty doe}
{Those bis sean glasses are dope  Does someone knows the name and model?}
{Em,respect from russia}
{Why Royce isn't huge is beyond me.}
{Just love Eminem}
{Danny Brown Lol}

EM if u read this, make it happen Kid...}
{Sean got the best verse imo I love Em but he just be doing too much nowadays smh he tries to jam pack so many lines and make it all complicated and complex to the point you don't wanna hear it}
{FLIGHTTEAM ☺♠}
{i see no comments about the song it self interesting. I guess it not about the music.}
{Big Sean's flow is crazy!!}
{I can't be the only one that thinks this isn't that good of a song.}
{ha ha ha i read through the comments they are so funny, no matter what you are saying u need to stfu. the comment section is to COMMENT on the VIDEO :) i thought the song was okay, bye now.}
{One of my faves from SHADYXV}
{When the rap music changed eminem stayed the same, hes an icon, doing what he loves and not giving a fuck who likes him or not. He came a long way since 97. Deffinatly ONE of the best rappers}
{Dej sounds about 13...}
{Eminem is badass but Royce went off}
{So much talk bout em but sean snapped on this }
{ASA joke Fuck off}
{Is it just me, or is this song the hardest Big Sean ever went? He was real, though. I think it was one of his best verses ever.}
{Eminem is not the greatest rapper  But he has dropped a lot of best hip hop songs of all time}
{eminem best}

{I love Em's and 5'9's verse, but I just hate the rest of them! And the guy at 3:00 sounds like a toddler having a temper tantrum that makes me pull my phone out and fucking skip his verse.}
{eminem is the best !}
{wtf did danny brown say....}
{Big Sean > Royce > Eminem > Danny Brown}
{best song ever}
{I don't really listen to Em's music, but after hearing the other people rap, I was like "Oh this is catchy" and then when Eminem rapped I was like "Woah" thus Eminem is truly a rap god}
{Best versus 1. Big Sean  2.eminem  3.royce  4.danny brown}
{Danny Brown and Eminem on the same song... awesome :)}
{This is one of the best songs Eminem made. This is a real Detroit rap if you understand what I'm talking about. When I listen this song I feel like I watch 8 mile again. This is awesome, Detroit is a default city, but it's a best place for rapper. This all empty buildings, like was made for rap. Rap lives there. And like Eminem said "scene is open for everybody equally" , so don'n cry about your place I the world, but go and show them all. Against everybody who stands on your way.}
{I love Em but Danny Brown and that girl ruined it. The best verse was Big Sean's }
{Yo Em, here's best freestyle I've ever heard from you. Thanks a lot, man}
{Go Russia, когда он уже приедет?}
{how the fuck am i only seeing this now}
{Eminemin kalitesi yine fark ediliyor.}
{I think Eminem vs everybody }
{sounds like EM finally went back to his old self. great song}
{This, so many brown nosers}
{Lmao}
{Lol go Danny}
{Yo this trick trick nigga. Who the fuck is he suppose to be?}
{Cant stop listening to this}
{Tupac cannot be touched his lyrics were not as complex as eminems but they said way more listen to they don't give a fuck about us ghetto gospel still relevant today I like eminem but tupac remains king of rap}
{Em is still the god}
{Danny brown looking like MC Search makes me feel warm inside. }
{Eminem brought me here and he nailed this song. Someone shoot the 3rd verse plz, his voice is annoyin like fuck}
{eminem fickt schonwieder alle weg xd}
{I must have put atleast 1 million views on this haha}
{danny brown ruined this, lets be honest...}
{I love Eminem's music but this song just has to much going on. Not on my list of favorites for sure.}
{Go Detroit}
{Damn Danny Brown is ugly, but he can spit so fuckin well}
{BIG SEAN FUCKIN SUCKED}
{No Guilty Simpson? No Elzhi? No Black Milk? No T3? No Illa J? No Phat Kat? Beat shoulda been produced by Apollo Brown. Part 2 need to have all of them, not just the mainstream/commercial artists.}
{that boy EM is in a WHOLE DIFFERENT level when it comes to RAPPING! }
{BIG UP EM! <3}
{Big Sean fucking killed his verse, my goodness.}
{Danny freaking BROWNNNN... "just a step away from Fellon (failin) thats why they call it the D"!!!!!}
{Отличный трек!!}
{if this is "Detroit vs Everybody", then where's D12 and Obie Trice?}
{Eminem had the best verse just cause of his delivery big Sean had the second best verse cause of his metaphors n Royce n Danny brown kinda similar}
{Everyone saying big Sean verse is ass isn't listening hating}
{So which one is Danny brown again?}
{I mean, eminem is dope and stuff, but I want slim shady back. Funny puns, offensive language, britney jokes, fuck school do drugs etc.  }
{you the best eminem . i'm  crasy about you .}
{Eminem , Big Sean and nonames...}
{Eminem is the best rapper in the world. Retarded ppl like bobby shmurda r wayyy behind where eminem is}
{*D. Brown - Dat hair doe! }
{God god eminem}
{I think eminem is the best rapper!}
{Just because he's not mainstream anymore that doesn't mean he fell off! He's still on top of a Game, His skills are more advanced than ever, He is truly a Rap God! }
{I came here for Danny Brown}
{big had the best verse shit gave me chills the whole way out}
{Rap God.. His rappin of like a DJ's  scratching hear that seems to be a good feeling to it}
{Best rappers of all time: 1.Pitbull 2. florida 3. soulja boy 4. Macklemore 5. chief keef}

{Ohhhhhhhh yehhh this is what it's all BOUT!}
{Eminem I don't know if you read this stuff in the comments but if you do I just wanted to tell you for saving my life everyday.

But I'm tired of if because their is always something that bring me right back down so thank you for everything.}
{respect (Y)}
{big sean slayed it no doubt without a doubt}
{Don't really understand how people could possibly say eminem ruined this song, Eminem is the greatest of all time in my OPINION! You can't deny that he's the most skilled rapper. Eminem has inspired me, I'm a 16 year old rapper that earned 3,000 subscribers in less than a year. Check me out!}
{Eminem is a good rapper but can you guys please not hold his nuts so much? Just a thought..}
{nice}
{I love you Eminem}
{}
{Однозначно лайк}
{Em is better then busta busta say random shit fuck busta}
{Every single one of his songs are the best songs EVER MADE.}
{Why don't you people piss the fuck off. You shouldn't give two shits if there are Stan fans, or true fans or fake fans or whatfuckingever. Enjoy the music, I hate people who are dissing off Stan fans thinking they are superior fans, fuck off, yea, they're probably dumb for not opening their ears to other rap music, but let them be, if they just want to listen to Em then let them, damn why does it get now so damn competitive. You guys are literally arguing that you are a better fan of Em 'cause you only hear him or 'cause you're more mature, i can assure all of you, no one gives TWO shits if you are a better fan or not}
{I liked Eminem back in the day, but his annoying ass fan base ruined it all}

{This song wouldn't be the same if it wasn't black and white}
{Does anyone else notice the heartbeat in the background of this song?}
{Detroit finest}
{4K gay people disliked}
{I like Em but damn some of y'all need to hop off his dick. And for those hatin, while I personally didn't like him in this song, he's not a bad rapper by any stretch-- rather one of the best in the game now and years ago. So act like adults, watch the video and leave either constructive criticism or fuck off with your opinion.}
{Detroit running this shit!!}
{I have to say who is the best rapper: THERE´S NO BEST RAPPER, it only depends on you. Example: A lot of people say that Tupac is the best but I don´t like, so, I don't say "what you say is bad, ******** is the best rapper. It's just a opinion and you must respect it. Respect everybody and respect their opinions and remember, THERE'S NO BEST RAPPER.}
{big Sean killed it on this}
{D12?}
{Big Sean killed it}
{I swear Danny Brown is the worst rapper to date... his voice is annoying as fuck man.}

{#Reading   #Jamaica   #Haiti   #France   VS  #Everybody  }
{you cant really say who the best rapper is. everyone has their strengths and everyone has their weaknesses. even Marshall Bruce Mathers. stop thinking so black and white.just respect the game}
{can't compare Eminem with nobody ! }
{eminem is trash }
{Damn, Eminem KILLED it.}
{this is why we call him "RAP GOD" fuck yeah}
{D12?}
{Notice they didn't let Dej drop a verse}
{I don't like this song too much  Hard to understand the hook and it seems like dej is a little off beat... I can't catch the flow from Royce, like what is his rhyme pattern? Big Sean was the best on the song... Meaning he was more understood Eminem still has outstanding lyrics, but all the rapping triple speeds needs to stop. I looooove hearing what eminem has to say and when I have to listen 10x harder, it's hard to enjoy the music. I'm a huge eminem fan!!!!!!! Got all the albums, books, magazine, poster on my wall, etc I just miss eminem when he would just rap. Not try to impress us with speed! It was cool for a moment, but I wanna get back to enjoying what eminem says!!!!}
{Good music. Stupid lyrics. Really stupid lyrics.}
{Eminem dominates this}
{Eminen vs. Everybody}
{}
{Big sean went in}
{my middle finger solute to you haters!!!!! EMINEM IS best.........}
{That's the best verse Big Sean has ever put out there and eminems just a beast i swear o" dude never left the 80's though}
{should a did it over a dilla beat}
{it hurts about Ukraine=(}
{Inb4 "skipped to em's part" and "song starts at 3:40" comments. Oh wait too late.}
{Em YOU GOD RAP!!!}
{Hes still really good but i miss the old eminem and he is one of the best rappers not sayin hes the best rapper of all time but his up there}
{If you really listen to it, eminem has a sick flow, especially in this song, but they all fucking killed it!}
{How do you make an Eminem die hard pissed? Tech N9ne should have been here.}
{Ems verse is the worse one in this track}
{Wow em still crushing best rapper ever rip tpac}
{I'd like the this song with or without the words}
{I got a question, do you wanna ride or die?}
{Why is everbody only talking eminem he not the only nigga on this song and why the fuck do niggaz still talk about pac and biggie they so fuckin old out all the rapper that has came out sense back then how the fuck can u say that thier the greatest}
{Жаль что такие люди как Еминем не могу жить вечно}
{good one}
{I used to be a fan of Infinite Eminem.  Don't like his flow now.  Way too choppy and all over the place.  Stopped buying his albums after the Slim Shady LP (other than his D12, Bad Meets Evil, & Slaughter House features).}
{cus its perfectly fine to have a twisted mind had some sane friends left them all behind cus their truly twisted the truth theyll never find pretending to be sane thats insane but never mind}
{Seriously dude, you are getting faster and faster, can't wait to here you with TECH N9NE, bring that shit on. }
{Great!!}
{Wow Eminem rappped fast 5 9 used some over the head shit as usual d brown street loaf new face n big Sean killed it trick gangsta bully}
{Eminem is best but they vs to everybody also to 2pac the god of rad}
{Danny Brown for the win, hmm hmm hmm}
{OMG 2:10 it´s that will.i.am???}
{Eminem and Danny Brown. Whoa! With them, how Detroit going to lose?}
{Ok, let me get this straight. People hate eminem because he has a large fan base? The stans? Well im sorry. People have heard other rappers before, its not like the only rapper they have heard of is eminem. Em came from the 90's, and has stood the test of time. Haters: "Em fans are so annoying." why? Cause they only listen to em? maybe "stans" are more into lyricism than beats. Its easy to relate to his songs. we can relate because he came from a shitty lifestyle, and even when he made it to the top, he didnt want fame he wanted money. Is it right to hate on a guy who wants money? When indeed that is what each and everyone of us wants. You "haters" are panzy ass faggots.}
{We miss you we need Slim Shady back 😈}
{Danny Brown scares me :/}
{Eminems my favorite rapper, but here are 15 other rappers that are AMAZINGLY dope (no particular order): 1.) Logic 2.) Jon Connor 3.) Royce da 5"9' 4.) Crooked I 5.) Cyhi Da Prynce 6.) Caskey 7.) Kendrick Lamar 8.) Joey Bada$$ 9.) Lecrae 10.) Nas 11.) Trip Lee 12.) Joe Budden 13.) Hopsin 14.) Jarren Benton 15.) Big K.R.I.T. I STRONLY encourage you guys to listen to at least some if these people. I think these guys along with maybe Snow Da Product, Joel Ortiz, and Ace Hood (sometimes... sometimes... sometimes)  make up the only good rap these days.}
{thank you eminem}
{THIS WHOLE TRACK IS ASS! LMFAO!!! 100% PURE GARBAGE}
{In my opinion they all did good and the song was good, but a song called "Detroit vs Everybody" has to be better than good. I feel like if there was a New York vs Everybody and they got both the old and new MCs for it that it would crush this easily.}
{that fatass at the end sounds hella like rick ross}
{SO GOOD Cant get enough of this! Em, who doesn't need a mentor like you. #RESPECT}
{Eminem is the man!}
{I shall go and visit Detroit one of these days!!!!!}
{It's not like they're ever gonna believe any of us. But I must confess I hate summing things up like this.}
{I Just watched Eminem Part :3}
{Do you wanna ride or die?}
{Is this new or old???}
{I'm sorry but em killed it}
{Who's the rapper with the crazy hair and glasses?}
{Enemin....forever..life}
{Dej Loaf: Decent chorus, not bad Royce: Fucking killed it man Sean: Honestly no flow at all... worst part of the song Danny Brown: Don't like his voice but still much better than Sean Eminem: Do I really need to say anything here? Trick Trick: Don't know why he's here but still cool}
{eminem is bad now honestly he just doesnt sound as good anymore}
{Trick trick?}
{best verses 1. Big sean 2. Royce da 5'9 3. Em 4. Danny brown all did good imo its a classic.}
{This is good}

{Obvsly eminem is the best rapper nowdays, but it is my opinion, i respect other's, there's no need to "fight" "eminem is the best" "eminem sucks" " 50cent and lil wayne rules" respect other people's opinion. to be honest i didn't like very much the eminem's flow on this song. IN MY OPINION big sean and 59 were the best. but for the eminem haters, eminem made history in hip hop world, so did 2pac. Eminem is the best alive <3 kisses and hugs bitches}
{Am I the only one who thinks Big Sean sounds just like old Eminem? Like back when he did Stan?}
{ya'll need to give respect to the rappers that paved the way FOR eminem to do what he does... eminem is defintly up there, but i dont get how you can say he is the best.... theres many underground rappers that are defintly better (my opinion!!!!)}

{Ehh, could've done w/o that hook from Dej Loaf.}
{Big Sean killed it I love Eminem but his was ok Danny Brown was pretty good I didn't like the first verse much That's my opinion}
{BigSean killed it!!!!!}

{Oh Wow Eminem <3}
{it doesn't matter how pathetically deep eminem fails at going lyrically or how many wignigs he features in his song, he'll ALWAYS be the worst artist/band of all existence. i'd love to see his angsty 13 year old fanbase prove otherwise LOL.}
{Eminem !}
{Damn Eminem vs the world is crazy }
{1. ROYCE 2. Sean 3. Danny Brown 4. Eminem No dissrespect}
{I think I understand why u people like rappers like Eminem and kedrick Lamar so much now is it because they dont wear chains and all the other flashy shit the other rappers wear and supposedly different. Well if that's not it I give the fuck up cuz those niggas not even that hot to be called the greatest of all time and so the fuck what is other rappers rap about bitches,money and violence that shit is hot and most of them came from nothing to something so that's why the fuck they show off and the ones who really hate that are white people and I really don't give a fuck about white peoples opinions because most of them hate because they wish they were them. For example Larry Bird gathered a lot of hype around him because he was white and the wanted a white person to be the best same thing with Eminem}
{yer danny brown ripppiinn}

{New York vs everybody or Cali vs everybody needs to happen}
{I fucking hate eminem but no doubt he is the best rapper ever.}
{Im sorry for my ignorance, but what does this "Stan" thing you are saying in the comments mean?}
{The second and third rapper kinda annoyed me. And eminem wasnt that good in this video, it wwould have been better is his speed matched the speed of the beat, he didnt have to go full speed the whole time. Btw who was the first rapper? I really liked him}
{Lol I wonder if Big Sean ever heard Royce's rap about skinny jeans.}
{beat was mad dope! obsessed with this beat right now}
{Nice track, big sean and Em tho. they killed it}
{Fosco Alma}
{Big Sean and Royce owns this song! they ripped it}
{Eminem may not have known this when he wrote it, but his line about getting along with the voices inside his head is strangely apt. According to psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman, the brains of creative geniuses and people with schizophrenia are similar in surprising ways. They both have an extremely active precuneus, or area that facilitates daydreaming and free association. The only difference is that unlike people with schizophrenia (and Stan), creative geniuses can distinguish between fantasy and reality. I just find this in random website }
{Lol rap is dead. Eminem was fucking wack! Hahahaha but let's Just say he "killed it" because it's Eminem.}
{Where is Xzibit, Esham, ICP not D-Town vs Everybody without them}
{im not even from detroit and i feel like repping, might even by a chrysler or sumn. GO PISTONS  #isiahthomas}
{Eminem could change his flow a 100 times and hed still be a lyrical genius. He killed that song and everyone who listened to every verse has to realise that.}
{Best lyrics = eminem  Best voice = eminem  Best flow   = royce}
{мне нравиться}
{so good i like it so true}
{In my opinion , Royce da 5'9 has overcome Eminem.}
{Your great voice gratulations}
{Yall can't tell me danny brown not raw as fuck}

{In this song i didnt feel em lmao. Big sean snapped!}
{i have listen to EMINEM since he made his first album he is the greatest}
{Danny Brown is annoying fuck}
{nice}
{Man it's so badass when em comes in}
{Royce: Amazing like always. Stunning word play. Great flow. Great introduction. A Big Sean: Too long. Flow dipped in and out. Decent word play. Overall a B Danny Brown: Highly underrated. Nice wordplay. Sets a great atmosphere. B+ Eminem: Nice Flow. Nice wordplay. Really consistent.  I give an A- Chorus: Im not a fan of Dej Loaf, or the chorus, especially seeing her try to look all thug. Sounds too bitchy. Not bad not good. C+ I give this song all together an A-}
{Ish wack.... Them artist can do way Better.....!!}

{Melhor clipe do eminen :D}
{The instrumental was poor other than that it was good to see all the Detroit rappers on one song!}
{granda rapper eminem i like your themes}
{eminem vamos el rap}
{Eminem at one point was my idol, I thought he was the best. But you listen to him enough and his flow gets old. The way he plays his words are mediocre, but his senseuality, and pain behind his voice Is what gives him the hype. And I respect that. Tell me how many rappers are still out there making music since 1997. But if you want something new and deep listen to machine gun Kelly: lead you on, halo, her song, the return, home soon, half naked and almost famous}
{Bad ass vid}
{Love eminem verse}
{The legend , best rapper ever}
{best or not i dont knw but eminems songs are like magnet , people just cant stop checkin it out. it pulls everyone defintly }

{Habitants de Détroit  you are the Best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!}
{Big sean's verse was the best, he flowed like no one else did, i loved Em's though too}
{Big Sean murdered everyone on this track.... Never thought I'd say that }
{Is it weird that i found the first rapper better than em!}
{Eminem is the greatest alive. You HATERS. CHECK his track record. CHECK his award record. CHECK his produce record. He is legendary and one of the greatest of all time Rapper/Producer. Period. If you dont like eminem you clearly DO NOT understand music at ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (haters)}

{Wow yall Eminem stans unbelievable. Don't give any credit and hate hearing honesty. Well here it is  1 Everyone's verse was sick but eminent was not better than Danny  Brown. He may sound goofy but he got bars 2. Eminem will never be back to the old self so stop complaining you want him back shut up  3. Every Rapper goes thru a mainstream phase some stay in it and some become 1 hit wonders and it looks like Eminem has stayed in it  4. I'm pretty sure Eminem likes brown and Sean tho have them on his song but all you stans like yo speak for him saying em dosent even like them OMG foh with that lol}
{prolly the best big sean verse ive heard i usually am not a huge sean fan but he killed it}
{The slaughter is real}
{Tupac is better than Eminem}
{This tracks dope.  Everyone killed it.  Don't know what Danny brown is saying but his part sounds real dope.  Detroit vs everybodyyyy}
{nigga Big Sean had the best verse next to em }
{The best rapper of all time is white and the greatest golfer of all time is black. What is wrong with this world. Lol}
{Fuck Detroit}
{ Royce da 5'9" and Big Sean are the only verse worth talking about everybody else was wack }
{Not even going to say my opinion on the risk of getting spammed with emails from the cancer that is 10% of eminems fans}
{All the top comments on here are a bunch of STANS with Em's dick in their mouth unwilling to admit to the fact that this dude has lost his sh*t. You know you have lost it all when you try too hard to please. EM tries to fit a billion words into a single verse causing the flow to suck. True fans who have being following EM not because he is WHITE, or he is the only rapper they listen to, would admit to the fact that this dude has lost his stuff. And now i feel like he is still relevant in mainstream rap cos his fans are part of the 70% white race in US. Tries too hard to make his verse very good and then ends up having a sh*tty verse. For those who disagree i suggest you wipe his CUM off your eyes and see. Plus get his dick out your mouth. You stans are pathetic. I didn't hear a single word.  PS. I have been an EM fan since 97. A bunch of your were still in the sperm race by then.}
{why is danny browns part so short? this mainstream shit makes me sick}
{Royce goes hard }
{flow crazy }
{SOO COOL !!!!!!!! U ROCK UR BUTTZ OF 😎}
{Eminem, you jave affected my ENTIRE life. I went FROM a artist nerd  to a Free-Style rapper. Thank you. You have inspired me to do this. Thank you for EVERYTHING you have done. It has really inspired me, to be a actual badass, not a wanna~be. Don't quit rapping. Keep up the best rap-art I have ever seen/heard.}

{I'm not a fan of Eminem (personal preference) but I think he was good I don't think Big Sean flowed too well in this though}
{IDK who this singer is at 2:50 but hw just made my eardrums rattle.}
{1st verse Awesome 2nd verse Good... 3rd verse What the fuck was that 4th legendary}
{The first verse is epic.}
{These other rappers other than em need more respect. Don't get me wrong Eminem is good but I asked a friend who's your favorite rapper eminem. I'm not saying eminem sucks but I think these other rappers need credit}
{What type of coat is Eminem wearing, the fur hooded one?}
{Eminem you don't have to be the shit you are the shit }
{EMINEM YEH <3}
{stg it annoys me soo fucking much when people drop a pretty decent rant about how eminem is better or worse and at the end asks to check out their content like wtf}
{people keep saying em is the only well he is good but look at others like Royce da59 Big Sean Busta 50 Cents Lil wayne? (This is debatable ) these are all not that bad}
{Danny Brown is amazing!}
{Bad hook. Dej loaf stick with try me.}
{The hook could have been a bit better...}

{EMINEM Comes in and BOOM.... GAme over !!}
{Peep my freestyles a new one drops everyday! Subscribe and peep my shit! #f95records}
{CHEMTRAILS.}
{A lot of people are complaining about Em lately.. Of course he's not the same. Hes in his 40's now and a grown ass man. BUT one thing that is the SAME is he destroys the mic lyrically. Always has and always will. Just my opinion tho. - If anyone's just chillin out on youtube for a bit and wants to check some true meaningful hip hop, check me out and let me know what you think. Not trying to spam like everyone does tho, just sayin if your relaxing sittin back looking for something to do, check it out in my channel!﻿}
{Eminem's part was the best}
{I think he is definitely still in touch with ordinary peoples struggles and pain and what's its like to have this life and most important is what is meaning of all of this}
{Dirtgames13 You forgot #5 The fools that act like there's some requirement to listen to Eminem like you some fuck boi.}
{Риал нигга щит рэп}
{I think you all should CALM DOWN! Eminem is a great rapper. And so is everyone else from this video. Yeah..I also think Eminem is the best, like many of you people...But if someone has a different opinion, just let him be! He isn't wrong, everyone's got a different taste and looks for different things and details...so just leave your stupid comments for yourself:)}
{Help me reach 1,000,000 subs by tomorrow!}

{Guys look too right there's two of their symbols!!illuminati confirmed}
{best rap song}
{Ill stuff}
{Eminem padre della musica hip hop}
{Not sure if it is Eminem vs Everybody or Detroit vs Everybody}
{if this song was with royce and eminem only it would be godlike.. I still like i though (':}
{Look im not going to say that Eminem is the best rapper of all time. But eminem is seriously one of the greatest rappers of all time and yea people may complain on why don't eminem go back to his old ways he was much better like that. The matter of the fact is that eminem is to old for that already and also he is trying to let that person go (Slim Shady.) But don't get me wrong eminem could turn to slim shady anytime he wants lol. But I guess he wants to leave that person. But either way he is still a beast slim shady or not. And if this J Cole situation keeps getting blown up I think Slim Shady Might have to come out. }

{Em's verse was straight fire. Damn!}
{Born and Raised in the D area until I recently moved to Houston half a year ago. This makes me home sick, but the biggest part of this video that made me the most sick was them showing Lafayette Coney Island during Em's verse w/ them coney dogs. Before Tigers and Lion's game, that's our joint. I remember one of our friends from out of town came w/ us to a Tiger's game and stopped at Lafayette's before. We all knew the drill: 2 coney dogs and fries. When it came to our friend from out of town he asked the waiter if they had a BLT sandwich. The waiter looked at him like he was going to kick him out the restaurant, ignored his question and said "whose next?" lol. Our friend was like 'what the hell' and we were like 'just give him 2 coney dogs'. }
{Why does everybody from Detroit rap like they didnt have enough time to say what they wanted to say?}
{Em has to slow down when rapping it's becoming a bad habit as I listen to more and more songs he uses fast rap a lot more now}
{-People that hate Eminem? Do this actually exist?  #eminemrocks   #hatersucks  }
{Detroit vs everybody except Oakland Ca.}
{Eminem killed it}
{Big Sean from CA why he representing Detroit}
{Fuck Detroit Everything>Detroit}
{Anyone that says Eminem is a better rapper than Nas , Rakim , 2pac , or the Notorious B.I.G makes me laugh}
{eminems got a million good verses...now he has a million plus one...}
{HipHop comes in generations...Em will never be better than 2PAC and Biggie since he was not around to rap with them. However EM is def better than a 50cent, TI, Jeezy, Big Sean....since hes around to rap circles around him. The only two main stream rappers that are as nice as EM are NAS and Jay Z etc.}
{Love Eminem  but Big Sean Murdered this track}
{Just saying does anyone really care whats on the comment section.... NO they don't, so stop wasting your time writing}
{who's the first second third and forth rappers  }

{Sick tune and never heard danny brown before but he smashed it, and to all the haters about eminem yet here commenting and listening just look up his achievements for a rapper, wiki it you whoppers}
{Best song omfg}
{Eminem's word play is still ill just in a different format.}
{Eminem is good but most of his lyrics are about killing women snd how hard his life was.  There's much better rappers than him that are new and old.}
{Perfect !!!!}

{Danny Browns the only one with a good verse.}
{This song is like OREO I only enjoyed the white part}
{Wow Eminem really loves Detroit, he even turned down the lead role of a movie because the director didn't agree with his request of shooting it in Detroit. Btw love the song, keep the good music coming 🎶}
{the best eminem}
{Rapping is like a mountain.. Mostly Black but white is at the top}
{Danny brown for life nigga}

{Royce was ok big sean and ems verses are fire danny brown is so fucking annoying}
{danny brown looks like a homeless}
{I was a huge fan of Eminem buts lets be honest, hes had like 4 or 5 relevant songs in the past 8/9 years}
{Big Sean and Eminem straight killed it}
{Eminem should rap wit logic}
{Marshall, One of the most controversial rappers of the century, still making better song than some of the people now. Hes around 40 years old, and still makes some amazing music compared to others.}
{All these haters cause he has more than u will ever have stop hateing and if you don't think eminem is any good no more. why the fuck write his name in your search bar!!! Eminem killed this and if you dint understand his rap these days its because your brain has no capability of  putting little puzzle together.}

{All That should be said about the quality of this whole song is that it sounds as grainy as it probably should}
{awesome anthem! everyone sounded awesome, just Big Sean...man...I don't know a little slow!, still dope though}
{Dear rappers, please stop adding siren sounds to your music. Sincerely, A high as fuck nigga :v}
{Eminem's old rap style was way better. }
{The end is Proof!!!! R.I.P Big Proof just because I saw proof made me like this song!!!! OK}
{Perfect! Perfect! Eminem ^^ :D}
{3:43 till 5:18 -best bit}
{Even though Em is not the same Em as before  , which was a better Em, his fast flow is still untouchable}
{It's time to stop kissing Eminem's ass. @EminemVEVO, you're loosing fans. Honestly, you are, and you're not gaining as much new fans as you're loosing the old ones. Shady XV sucked. Your delivery was poor. Your rap verses sounded aweful. I don't know wtf happened to you, maybe cuz you think you're a rap god now you can do whatever the fuck you like? You think you don't need to rhyme anymore, so you just mumble-jumble your words and force them onto a beat? Come on Em. Honestly, very honestly, you ruined this song. I'm sorry to say but it's the truth. I know you can do better. Work on it.}
{Why is Eminem hiding his hair? He also hid it in Guts Over Fear. After releasing recocery, I thought he had gotten over the old Slim Shady. Next thing he released MMLP 2with the famous blonde hair. Now, he's in-between. What's going on? To me, it seems like this is a new state, between Marshall, and Slim. A state that isnt so good at rapping, or fucks up his verse out of whatever. The Eminem I know is way way better than the Eminem in this album. Em, what's going on?}
{The Chorus is horrible...everything is fine. }
{I LOVE Musique Eminem et La Bande du Rap Jay z Dr Dree Snoop Doog and Beyoncé La Seule Femme Des USA}
{Royce kills it,,big Sean flow is way futuristic and this Danny Brown guy is fucking beast mode..and em does aight too}

{9m in two days this is going to be a big hit/popular. }
{Big Sean has far and away the best verse on this song. creative word play and changing flow}
{Every Eminem video y'all have the same comments }
{Shit Danny where'd that come from?  Too dope.}
{I'm a whole fucking month late. Better late than never though.. Love this!}
{i think it's funny people say eminems the best of all time and have no reason why}
{Every verse is awesome   the more i listen to Seans the more i like him}

{eminem fans are shitty. most of you guys claiming your his biggest fan ever or saying is the only good rapper come on.... 90% of the people watching eminems videos proberly only know like 5-10 of his songs..... if your a real fan of him buy his albums to support him. stop listening only to his singles.... dont only listen to his flow also listen to the lyrics... if you can say atleast 30 not mainstream or singles then you can come here saying that your a fan. if you cant the stop dickriding him just to clear this up im a really big fan of him... i can say some of my favorite songs with him :) if i had criminal deja vu my darling drug ballad going through changes talkin to myself brain damage rock bottom difficult your never over just a few of my favorites:) these songs should of have gotten many more fand but no people caliming to be real fans only lidten to : love the way you lie, im not afraid, bezerk, the monster, survival, rap god, lode yourself.... these songs are really good but come on he made better music only rap god, lose yourself, im not afraid deserved so much fans}
{the white part is the best !}
{This is what REAL Hip Hop is all about. Good-Azz Ryhmes going in a Good-Azz flow. Where did all the times go?}
{i think ems music is great but hes not the best}

{I just love how the fucker love to hate on em because he is white and then hate us because we love em  They think the only reason why we love em is because he is white, WRONG I like em because of the shit that he went through ( like other rappers ) then makes it sound so amazing so last thing The hate us because they ain't us  They are peanut butter and jealous}

{Eminem Raper's man}
{2.55 WTF?}
{Once again Congratulations EMINEM . The song is good. BUT . I'm sorry I dont live in Detroit.}
{You guys killed it dawgs}
{Eminem should make a track with Lecrae! Rap God & God's Rapper :D}
{Eminem fell off after Encore.}
{Nice :3}
{Two things I did not like. The female singer, while I thought the hook was catchy and her voice was definitely interesting I wished they used her a bit more in a bridge or something but considering the length of the song I suppose I can understand. The verses were amazing!! But my goodness the ending with "Trick Trick" was just bad. I'm all for a good spoken verse and in the beginning he had me with "you riding with us, or getting rolled on" so I thought he was gonna speak a little more on Detroit pride, no I'm not from there but I love songs about hometowns, especially when they are executed well. But then he kinda ruins it with asking Eminem for, and correct me if I'm wrong, the instrumental to this song he is featured in so the "lil homies can get in on that remix" what did that have to with anything with the previous 5 mins? Where did that request even come from? Then he gets back on track, sort of, and just screams "Detroit!" Well I guess a recovery is a recovery. I'm assuming all the scenes with each rapper were shot at different times. Obviously these guys have hard working careers, I highly doubt they all had the same day available to shoot a video, otherwise I'm sure we would have seen at least one shot with them together, and when the editor reviewed Trick Trick's footage there was just not enough time to reshoot and simply worked with what they had. If he was actually told to say this, not likely, then I'm sorry but what a wrong move. But at least the good out weighs the bad. Also I feel like the people with Trick Trick were ordinary Detroit citizens, love the choice, evidence is at the very end with the song title displayed one them begins to leave and a few others just acting like they were new to music video shootings or something. It just made the whole Trick Trick part simply bad. Also who is Trick Trick.  He seems like someone who has been around for while but I do not know who he is was/is he a part of Goon Sqwad? Curious.}
{Big Sean is so Slick}
{One of my favourites.}
{Четко  ) }

{AWSM}
{I'm a real Em fan. Not a fucking "STAN" or whatever the fuck you call it. Slim Shady's flow and delivery mixed with articulation and creativity are untouchable by any other rapper that has EVER EXISTED. NOBODY CAN DENY. NOBODY CAN COMPETE. Talk shit all day, but there's a reason why nobody fucks with the white boy. Quote The Game.}
{Bruh... all I can think of is how much Big Sean looked like Fleece Johnson when he put them glasses on. He needs to fire his stylist!}
{Pish}
{If Slim died, he'd be bigger than Pac AND Biggie.}
{This shit go hard. Em and sean saved the song tho. Royce let me down and def loaf...anyways. The beat nasty tho}
{Big sean sucks}
{Holy shit, I'm cringing so hard at all these 12 year olds saying "Eminem is the best rapper of all time". Yes, he has released a couple of near perfect albums, but nowadays he's just decent. And no, he isn't the only good mainstream rapper. Danny Brown, Ab-Soul, Joey Bada$$, Kendrick Lamar, Earl Sweatshirt are arguably better than him at the moment.}
{Kill a babysitter with a potato peeler???}
{Eminem is bring it back to the under ground bruhh this how you know he still got it and will be here for years to come }
{Reading coments like "why people, "why this , why that .... Fu..c it man , just enjoy this music de all know em is the best , i dont need to prove it , numbers speak, history speak , if u like other raper , go and listen to him , i like a lot of rapers like , lil wayne, yelawolf , tyga and what?}
{Y'all gotta get off Eminem's dick... Royce, Big Sean and Danny all had verses as good as Eminem, if not better. Some serious dickriding going on in the comments. Go out and explore the diverse world of Hip-Hop.}
{Eminem fans are children ain't NO grown adult lookin out for the next Eminem album. Shit was mad creative back in the day with his classics but he's a different artist now - pandering to all these fucking close minded pop fans who can't tell you who KRS One or even Rakim or Big Daddy Kane is. REAL TALK}

{Danny Brown has the sickest flow in this entire video.}
{I won't so many remixes of this.Some could be... Atlanta:Andre 3000, Jarren Benton, Childish Gambino, and T.I. Compton:Dr.Dre, Kendrick Lamar, Ice Cube, and The Game. Nyc: Busta Rhymes, Papoose, 50 Cent, and Loyd Banks.}
{i only came here to hear what Danny Brown was gonna spit and see if i could understand it }
{Well big sean snapped on this}
{DETROIT-vs- EVERYBODY #SOUTHWEST}
{A lot of people are complaining about Em lately.. Of course he's not the same. Hes in his 40's now and a grown ass man. BUT one thing that is the SAME is he destroys the mic lyrically. Always has and always will. Just my opinion tho. - If anyone's just chillin out on youtube for a bit and wants to check some true meaningful hip hop, check me out and let me know what you think. Not trying to spam like everyone does tho, just sayin if your relaxing sittin back looking for something to do, check it out in my channel!﻿}
{Eminem really shoulda done this song by himself he killed it in his verse he is and always will be the rap god}
{Who is DarkZero  2006 a nobody  2007 started to listen to eminem 2008 - 2010 got bullied  2011 turned emotions into a rap 2012 started to look for a label 2013 -2014 never found one 2015 this year is the year}

{cool }
{Danny Brown is such a poor artist. The rest of this song is absolutely brilliant but Danny Brown just doesn't suit the beat and I do not understand a word he says. He was very poor when he supported Eminem in Wembley last year as well. Otherwise this song is very strong and this or Y'all ready know is the best song on Shady XV.}

{Dej Loaf sounds like the 21 meme}
{Rapping is like a mountain. Mostly Black and White at the top}
{This is the first time in history when the white guy is more difficult to understand in a rap song.}
{Honestly Royce had the greatest verse on here and it was the most enjoyable to listen to. He executed his verse perfectly.}
{this was awesome}
{I like emiem but to not all his songs. Is he the best? Well that's really an opinion and I can't say he is, but he is good, which is something people can not deny, not great but good. I really like this because it showcases  Detroit, all the good and bad. The people of the city have, like me, a passion for it. Why else would we try and save it? We will save it, maybe not today or tomorrow but eventually we will because people in Detroit never know when to quit, whether that be good or bad. To a city that can never and will never die.}
{DANNY! HAHA yeeeah}
{They all did so much damage on this one, I like Big Sean's part the most, couldn't understand too much of what Eminem was saying and the hook is sooo stupid lol}

{Eminems most important song on his newest album only has 9 mil views and there are 6 rappers on it and he like fucks up the entire song like wtf is this. the first 2 rappers are good and should make an album than there is some weird clown who needs to be removed and than there is eminem who raps while holding his breath.

{you gotta love royce' flow}
{Like if you had to turn on subtitles for Danny Brown.}

{#here for Dej Loaf and eminem tbh}
{Damn, I had no clue who Danny Brown was before this track, but that verse of his was sick. I guess now I gotta go and check his work out.}
{I literally Googled Lark Voorhies' face after Royce mentioned her. Gotdamn. LOL.}
{Detroit Vs. Everybody}
{eminem did kill it but i find they all did i don't see why anybody is hating on anybody every body had good delivery punchlines rhymes }
{How they gonna say Detriot vs Everybody when Atlanta on top!!!}
{People comment their opinions on videos as if they're facts😂 everyone has their own opinions and are all different so sit down and shut up If You have if you don't have anything nice to say}

{Ask any white person who's there favorite rapper is it's em...lol his fan base is full of  teenage  early 20 white mofos that don't understand anything about the "art" (rap/hip hop) "oh I love em he doesn't't talk about money bitches n weed like the other rappers n his lyrics dude!" ok well people like this obviously don't  listen to much rap n wouldn't even give others rappers a chance cuz there black, don't get me wrong Em is the top lyricist next to nas n most likely in the top 10 best rappers ever. (This is to filter out real fans from fake the white ones I mean, n I'm not racist I just don't think white people will ever understand our "art" but they love it for some reason)}
{Who is Russia?}
{fucking royce its a beast}
{This is my favorite song... I LOVE IT}
{Like if you thought Royces part was DIRTY}
{Royce definitely had the best verse.}

{Marshal you are such a GOD <3}
{eminem and bigsean killed the beat}
{Круты как всегда)}
{Big Sean's lyrics and flow was suprisingly good haha}
{If i remeber him he didint use so much fast rappin in his first two albums (later i stop listening him), i cant remeber when i heard his song without that fast flow}
{The Beat Is Fuckin' Sick}
{dej loaf sucks}
{Sorry but the 1st guy had the best verse and I don't even know who he is}
{Dej loaf ruined it tbh}
{My opinion, Big Sean had the coolest flow}
{Eminem doesn`t need a disstrack. He only has to make songs with other rappers...}
{Eminem killed his part!}
{You know why Em is the man? Because he not just makes brilliant music, but he's busy with putting other great artists on the map... }
{weak song...}
{big Sean verse is the best }
{Eminem is da best (Y)}
{i know your  new mind but don't hurt your almost old girl cause she is new to you don't toss no matter how she acting work with it its your job}

{Why the hate on eminem he is the best rapper at the moment al the rap it is about now is "Fuck bitches get rich" but Eminem raps about his life youth I can not understand you hate Eminem... ( My opinion )}
{Big Boi From outkast and common are the only rappers I think are better than eminem}
{Супер клип! ... и девушка интересная ... Английского не знаю, но поверхностно понял.}
{hi im a 19 year old rap producer from Chicago if you can pls take the time to read my lyrics i wrote thx Swag Swag Swag I just shit my pants i feel the shit melting inside  for some reason it makes me dance my mamas keeping her stance  shut up you mockers  you cant judge me cause the shit smells lovely  mom please hug me and have the smell of shit under your nose ill tell you a secret last night i fucked hoes while my pants were full of shit and now i dont want to wash my ass  but if i dont my moms gonna give me a smack im cleaning the shit  sticking my hand in my ass pulling it out  screaming oh lads this shit is class if its good i will go to the x factor next week}
{Eminem is a legend. He's still capable of dropping shit like this}
{I don't like the abrahamic faith. I mean em admits to hypocrisy..but big sean is christan singing i don't fuck with you. You never meet Buddhist that are so ungraceful and rejecting of the people around them}

{Royce's Verse: Dope  Sean's Verse: Good  Danny Bown's: Coulden't understand a thing except from the Fat bitches scissoring bit  Eminem: Awesome  Trick Trick: What did he even do?}
{luv it <3 }
{This is a great thing!}
{I just have to wonder out of pure curiosity.. God rest his soul, But i wonder what a verse from proof would have been like on this song. Or.. What would have happened if he had been gifted with a few more years of breath, All i can do is wonder.}
{Danny Brown spit the only decent verse here. }
{ابعثونا لديدرويت نعمروها تحية من تونس}
{danny brown killed this}
{This song goes deep, I listened to every word, and all the hate on Eminem, its just people that are envious that they are not in his spot, its quite sad.  But we go out an idolize people like Nicki Minaj, modern society is going to hell.  I always got my old school hip hop station on Pandora.}
{EMINEM IS JUST AWESOME........!!!}
{The last guy is a really good rapper, he's definitely going to go far.}
{I didn't know Dave Chapelle started rapping...}
{Ugh, why put anyone else on the song? The only good part is Eminem. Seriously, why bother? I feel like this is a spoof song. Where did they find these other goons? And that Dave Chappelle lookin' guy around the two minute mark...hahaha.}
{Em went hard that last verse! Respect due, lyrically close to his peak}
{I was keeping up just fine until Eminem got up and now I'm just lost. I used to have to rewind his shit to catch up, but that was ages ago and I learned to keep up with that, but now he's just so unpredictable that you have to listen and listen and listen to get it all. There's a reason most people consider him among, if not, the best. No disrespect to the others. I'm from Nothern Ontario, but I went through high school listening to Eminem and D12 so for that reason I take pride in Detroit despite having no grounds to do so. This is an awesome song. I wish to see much more from Detroit in this arena.}
{I like this song I think it was good.}
{I love this}
{Eminem Is In His 40's And Is Boss Against The Rest}
{Who else thinks danny brown messed this song up?}
{Emienm i vote}
{What's making you think I need a switch? Because I'm Adrian Peterson when he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid? On a track, you get spanked like he just did.}

{So nasty}
{rae sremmurd would beat eminem tupac and biggie in a freestyle }
{God Eminem's music( and all music)  has changed since I grew up}
{I get the whole "supporting new rappers" kinda thing but jesus christ that dude that was right before eminem was baaaddddd....  Like that dude should of been cut from the video}
{Got that shit right}
{Eminem is coming back slowly, but he is coming back}
{This video was ok.}
{amazing song, horrible music video, they just dancing wit they hands the whole time, lame }
{Sean slayed it}
{Royce da 5'9" en EM are awsome}

{Eminem sucks.}
{I fucking hate the way that chick says Detroit "vers" everybody. I just wanna punch her the whole time}
{by far the worst cypher ever }
{I can't understand what the guy was saying before eminem's verse.}
{I look down to the comment section to see the comments on the song, you know the reason the comment section there? And instead I see people hating on eminem 😂}
{this is RAP}
{3rd verse No, just no}
{If I could get a version of this song with Danny Brown's verse excluded then I would be happy. Voice is just too annoying.}
{How i can save eminem part}
{The song really dig how much you can talk ......}
{los putos amoss!! carajo!!!}
{Saddest thing about these comments is Em fans think they are being fans by liking anything he says and hating on anyone who is on a song with him but honestly Em did not have the best verse on this song more like the 3rd best. He could have done better and realism makes artist get better not jock sucking. I like Em better then Big Sean especially after Big's last album but Big Sean caught us off guard and had the best verse and instead of hating be a real fan of Hip Hop and give props. That is all. }
{This song is the shit eminem you the best}
{Eminem is a fucking GOD <3}
{I came here to say مرحبا انا مروان تلودي}
{db}
{YAAH!!!!! Song starts at 3:39!!!!!!!}

{DETROIT LOVES EMINEM BECAUSE HE FROM AND LOVES DETROIT. WE JUST STILL MISS TUPAC THOUGH.}
{and im really glad he is back on top of the game}
{Well..... im a stan forever I worship Eminem}
{Eminem because with such animals?}
{6:01 minutes for video 6+1 = 7  7 Eminem Albums made}
{Sad day when Big Sean has the best verse. lol... but seriously though... he killed it.}
{Эм читает как перепуганный пёс. Эти исполнители давно стали популярными и живут в роскошных домах, тем не менее всё жалуются на своё прошлое, пытаются доказать, что они еще в "Детроитском" движении, но это отнюдь не так. Уже не знают о чем читать, так решили к истокам вернутся.. Уже не выйдет}
{Eminem is Rap GOD so all stop hating him beacuse of what he says...}
{Pac , BIG and Nas, way ahead of Eminem}
{heard the day it came out}
{who are all these terrible rappers em got in his song wow they stink i know em is trying to help struggling artist's but damn son wtf}
{  Guys who are saying "fuck the new eminem we want the old shady back" should think about what they are saying..slim shady has not had a nice life he was drug addicted had no money etc...i grant eminem to have a better life now..his ruined childhood will never be fixed though..but what i want to say is that i am happy that eminem isnt that old unlucky slim shady anymore...﻿}
{Эминем приедь пожалуйста в Россию}

{E M I N E M}
{IM 12 YEARS OLD AND FROM GREECE AND THIS SONG IS VERY GOOD}
{Only Eminem }
{Like if you're just here to listen to music and don't want to fight about who is a better artist. (Like really, this is an Eminem video, stop bringing up 2pac, Biggie, ect...) (Also, I'm a huge eminem fan, but I don't suck his dick by saying he's the best. There's plenty of better Underground rappers.)}
{big sean doee}
{Eminem you rocked (Y)}
{Skip to 3:39 your welcome.}
{Im only here to see my Baby Dej Loaf and to here uncle Trick,Trick talk that shit #Noflyzone}
{Медведь водка балалайка}
{EM has sold more albums Than any other rapper, right? He has influenced people all over the world, right? ( not just fucking kids), he has the most influental lyrics ( maybe more of his old stuff) right? Don't get me wrong. I listen to a lot of rap. Biggie, Tupac, Em etc. But to me, EM is the best rapper. Not saying That because i'm white. I look up pac ( especially) a lot.  EM's flow isn't That great today. But before, damn. But his way to express himself is brillant. Favourite rap/ hip-hop songs; Way i Am, Mockingbird, Ghetto Gospel, Dance With The Devil.}
{1:29 BrrBrr))}
{Eminem and Big Sean are bleeding awesome rappers...but the rest are pretty good too.}
{is it just me or danny brown does sound like a duck.....? and his looks matches his voice perfectly :D}
{Eminem killed hip hop. He created a cultural fusion. Ten years ago, middle class white boys weren't listening to rap, but Eminem merged these two very different groups, creating modern "hip hop." Eminem is chill, but his success fucked up the industry}
{ANYONE who EVER SAID that em's garbage and that only dickriders listen to him doesn't understand a single thing about rap music. End of fucking story.  Now I'm not sayin he's the best of all time (although he probably is IMO), but dude's a fuckin genius lyricist, stop hatin for no reason whatsoever and start listenning and paying attention to the fucking lyrics. Even if u don't like him (which i find very difficult cuz if u like rap music then there MUST be some em songs that you'd like, he released around 300 tracks so...) that's no reason to be hatin cuz that's just a fuckin OPINION (not shared by many). But the FACT is he is a mad lyricist, fuckin most successful and awarded rapper of all time.}
{Say what you want about eminem but his mic skill is unparalleled.}
{Couldn't even understand what Em was saying sounded like somebody fast forward through his verse , Danny Brown look like doodle bob with a fuck up ass wig .haha. but big Sean killed it}
{yay}
{nice to hear old school rap.. where NO ass and booty is involved....}
{don't fuck with me , everyone else singing .....eminem singing bitch please}
{Eminem is more of a hip-hop God than a Rap God.}
{Em killed it. Surprised? You shouldn't be, he should be locked up from how many verses he kills.}
{Eminems my favorite rapper, But even I have to say Danny Brown murdered everyone.}
{this song ends at 3:43 for me}
{Fuck Eminem i'd rather listen to nicki minaj and iggy azalea}
{who is the third rapper?With the missing teeth}
{"What makes you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson" Damn Slim. Damn.}
{who's the girl i wanna know her name sorry if i sound like i dont know shit :c }
{EMINEM KING <3}
{The sad part is em is a proving style bitter.. CAGE hands down is a beast.. What is eM doing now?? His flow was lost it's actually horrible. Cage is  a way better MC}
{great video, everyone has their own style. As always, Eminem killed it!!! I effing love you shady!}
{Detroit the big d}
{Danny Brown...... ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? That was terrible Including Big Sean}
{eminem too}
{i like big seans rapping}
{los guapos van al final!! ✌}
{Why does the guy at 2:58 look like one of the guys from key and peele}
{Big Sean murder his verse}
{Why do people say eminem is popular because he is white? Tupac is popular and he is black. So if tupac was white he would be popular. If eminem was black what would happen? Btw I'm not trying to be racist}
{What are the rapper names like in order they seem very good but i don't know who they are? Not hating just a question}
{Did trik trik really need to be in this song}

{Thecolboy3 y does it matter that he is white he literally is better then almost every rapper alive just listen to rap god at super sonic speed because in like 20sec he said 100 something words but I guess it's just a opinion}
{Lol the third guy fucked up all the song}

{I still can't believe some of y'all niggas think that Big Sean and Danny Brown had better verses than Royce and Em lol.}
{I have been an eminem fan forever, but i also love all these other rappers. Eminem is an idol to many rappers, he is the most successful no doubt and he doesnt have to go throw around his money to show it off. he doesnt rap about just bitches and money either. Em is a definite legend and will never die.}

{I'm a Detroit rapper but I can't fucks with the beat because it's not me. lol}
{yes enimem made a new song!  :D}
{I like old school eminem, but I respect the new eminem. At this point, rapping like he used to would be counter productive. I'll slap you. Lol}
{As soon as 2:56 came up... and that wacko (who I have never seen nor heard before) started rapping, this song lost 9/10ths of its credibility.}
{Not a good message}
{Good}
{At least they are rapping together instead of shooting each other.}

{If u know hip hop know about Royce and prem slaughterhouse for two decades. Always best doing it. Hip hop for life}
{Em garbage foreal...but as long as ppl worship Jesus and are constantly programmed by white supremacy....em will remain your rap god}
{ Em needs to slow the fk down, you can't even hear half of what he says,shit is wack man , real talk.If I have to keep rewinding the shit to hear everything, I don't want to hear it. Just hearing Trick's voice killed EM's fast talking crap. Trick a real solid G, Big Herk, Rock Bottom...etc  Give anything to have Blade Icewood back<<<his azz was smooth as fk, now I can feel all Blades shit strong, it's pimp shit, now that right there is the real deal. LET'S BE REAL, THE REAL TIMES ARE OVER, MANY MANY YEARS AGO, WHEN SHIT WAS REAL, AND CATS SPIT REAL SHIT. Now it's all playdo. I quit listing to new shit almost 12 years ago. My cd case is 1999 and back.  The only radio station I listen to is 93.5 kday out of L.A . Shout out to everybody in Southwest AILCN  I don't give a fk, how many thumbs down you dick riders throw at me.}

{1. Royce Da 5"9 2. Eminem 3. Big Sean 4. Danny Brown}
{this song hits hard}
{God damn Danny Brown is fuckin terrible please just stop i can never even make it thru one of his verses}
{2:55 seems like a lil autotuned off tune there}
{Check my music channell}
{dope song  definitely check it. }
{I think every rapper in this song has talent. Everyone needs to calm down with eminem though. Who cares what his skin color is, he has talent. So does every other rapper in this song. White people... be nice to the black people. Black people... be nice to the white people. It's 2015 everybody, can we start accepting each other regardless of the color of their skin? We're all human}
{Amazing songgggg, and forever and ever Eminem is the best. }
{Detroit Vs. Everybody ? Nobody gives a damn about what set you claim... I claim Naptown & all we have is Mike Epps lol}
{Royce da 6'9 Kappa}
{Em's verse is weak. Just because you can rap fast doesn't mean it goes well with everything, just ask Busta Rhymes. Meanwhile Sean and Danny killed it. Not hating, just didn't think this 1 verse from him isn't "RapGod" material.}
{BIG SEAN KILLED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!}
{5:49 Big Proof! BTW Eminem sucks dick nowadays}
{Danny Brown is that dude...}
{check me out ( 15 Year old rapper )}
{Em will forever kill it and stab it like villain with a mask on, fuck it he will forever dominate and dont even gotta take the mask off, cuz hes the villain of this rap game everybody at their last drop cuz he will retire errybody until they all become his fuckin mascot}
{BIG SEAN <3 ŁAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!}
{I'm inspired by em}
{OMG O_O --' White Rap ... EMINEM ... Please ...  Please Everybody STOP SAYING IS THE BEST RAPPER ... WE ALL KNOW TUPAC IS THE RAP GOD ... EMINEM CAN'T BE RAP GOD ... THE FUTUR RAP GOD IS ON WEST-COAST ... BECAUSE THE ACTUAL WEST-COAST RAPPER / DO THE SAME TUPAC 1990's SHIT ... WEST-COAST BEST COAST NIGGA ...}
{Imagine The Weeknd and Eminem doing a song together...that would be sick as fuck.}
{royce always be killing it big sean did pretty well if not one of the best on here, He did a better job of keeping his verse in my mind after the song ended than eminem. feel like this beat or whatever doesn't really fit eminem or at-least eminem didn't adapt to this beat like he usually could. either way his lyrics were spot on but he didn't deliver it as flawless as the rest(most) of the people did on this song}
{Eminem Da 5'9 and Big Sean lyrics Go Hard And Dej two}
{BOOM!}
{Christmas presents}
{Don't say you miss the old Eminem, but then ignore his new music. Whether your favorite song is My Name Is or Guts Over Fear, still listen to him, he's always been great and he'll still be great}

{Sub to my channel. I sub back}
{nice}
{all these legends coming together woooo}
{Facts about this song: 1.Dej Loaf can't tie her shoes 2.Danny Brown doesn't know what he's rapping about}
{No matter how good/bad Danny Brown's verse, I won't be able to take them seriously because of his voice lol}
{Ace! getting down in the Hood! Like it!! EM Boss Song.}
{Royce Da 5 "9" --killed it Big Sean-- killed it Danny Brown-- Took a giant shit on a otherwise awesome track the the previous 2 rappers built up before he got on it Eminem-- Swoops in to clean up the mess that Danny Brown just made, and save the track (also killed it) Dej Loaf-- sounds like Rihanna hung over, or with a cold, and her chorus is kinda weak.  all in all a good track with a few speed bumps if you will, }
{This is what happens when Bad Meets Evil.}
{You can find the 3rd rapper on there on the newest ridiculousness}
{Holy shit. I'm sorry but the chorus is SO bad. Why did they even think that would be good..? Come on, man. That sounded so stupid. I loved Sean's part the most, tho.}
{Greatness}
{Eminem=Goat}
{You can tell EMINEM is doing theese songs to help his people ,because they sick ..lol}
{1 St verse ok  2nd one crap 3rd one wtf was he saying waas he rapping or spraying it get hair cut dude and rap properly abs stop dancing like a muppet 4th one legend eminem u are a fuckin legend}
{I actually liked Danny brown's verse.}
{eminem amazıng tupac fantastic okey everbodyyyy}
{Sorry but, the second guy is not really good in my opinion.}
{Dej is is so dope!}
{skip to 3.39 for Eminem}
{just go to 3:39}
{Damn Em fuckin killed it}
{Look at all that white folks taking up for Em lol in reality Sean and dej loaf had the best delivered parts but bitch its DETROIT VS EVERYBODY!!!}
{got to love the images of the Detroit area in the vid. to bad Joe Louis is going to get brought down for a new stadium.}
{Man i do not like Big Sean BUT you are just a hater if you think he didnt snap on this beat. Dude had metaphors for days that were actually relevant towards the topic and it feels like he really was into this song.}
{Respect From France!!!!!!!!  Special mention has Royce da 5'9, for me he has killed the beat!!!!!!!!!!!}
{I swear Eminem fans can be so annoying. Yes, he is an amazing rapper. Is he the greatest of all time? No. Only an amateur who doesn't avidly listen to rap would claim that. There are rappers out there who, if you listened to them (and closely at that), would blow your mind with their amazing double entendres, wordplay, metaphors etc., Not to say Eminem doesn't have all these qualities in his music as well, but you can't master all of them. Em's strong suit is definitely lyrical ability and rhyme schemes, doesn't mean he is the amazing at all aspects of rapping. Rapping fast isn't the one and only aspect of rap, people. Other rappers can rap fast too, if they wanted.}
{I think danny brown and Big sean had the best verses in this song imo}
{trick trick part is better than big sean and danny brown :p}
{Fuck Big Sean he fucks with a 9 year old girl and he can't even rap good man idk why eminem likes him i mean Royce Da 5'9 is so good than that pile of shit}
{Eminem the king of the rap}
{Damn !!! Em always goes harder than everybody else on the track always !!!!!!!!!  Em = Legend !}
{TOO LONG....WACK!!!!! :-P}
{Hahaha, Danny Brown is soo weird.}
{watch this because of Eminem..}
{Showed a hint of himself, talkin about adrian peterson beating his kid}
{Em killed all of them! lol on this song.}
{muido bom }
{I only lusten ti Em because he's the main one that doesn't rap to sound cool, like shit about money and how many women he can have sex with. I'm a Eminem fan, not a "rapping" fan}
{In order of how i felt the verses were Big Sean Eminem Royce Danny Brown Just read Big Seans lyrics or really listen to his verse and the wordplay and metaphors he uses are just fucking amazing. }
{When my friends say bobby shmurda is a good rapper i just link them this video, and tell them to rethink there music choice.}
{Royce murdered it, Sean suprized me, couldn't understand shit Danny brown was saying, and eminems verse was boring, still big em fan, but this verse was hyped for no reason}
{this song is amazing 😍😍😍}
{In what Eminem's mind why would he ft big Sean and danny brown. Sean verse was just lazy he look like he was bored. Danny verse was flat out dumb can't really hear what he's saying.}
{Eminem is SHIT. NOT THA SHIT. BUT PLAIN SHIT! AS IN GARBAGE. I like his song Stan and a couple others. But he only gets so much hype because 63% of the US population is the same color as him, and supports his album sales. Most black people don't consider him #1 #2 or even top 5 for that matter. }
{The fact that people are saying Big Sean's verse was weak and that Eminem's verse what the best makes me realize how much of a dick rider people are. Eminem had the 3rd best verse on the song, behind Royce and Big Sean. And to say Big Sean had a weak verse just proves that you skipped his verse. }
{}
{Eminem is a dope emcee. ..with a bunch of dickriders as his fans....}
{I was proud to see Dej Loaf in yhe chorus and Big Sean & Danny brown did great on they verses compared to new school rap and old school with eminem and royce}
{Royce's verse - 10/10 Big Sean's verse - 8/10 Dany Brown's verse - 4/10 Eminem's verse - 10/10}
{EMINEM IS A BOSS}
{Eminem is not a human being, jeeeeez.}

{Eminem wrote all the verses}
{Eminem definitely aging well compared most white people lol. Look the same as when he first came out.}
{Great song}
{3:39 to skip the bullshit. }
{Eminem just proved why he's the best rapper to walk the face of this earth.}
{that Adrian peterson line was cold lol}
{Big Sean and Em are the only ones who go hard af 💯🔥}
{magariaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  }
{E' un genio! Eminem tutta la vita!  BIG UP.}
{hard to believe eminem is 43y/o}
{This would be brilliant if it didn't have Don King's son in it!!....}
{If drake and Lil Wayne was in this}
{Danny brown looks like a homeless man}
{the hook and royce the 5'9 were whack af }
{Eminem or not. Finally get to hear some good stuff nowadays}
{Whenever i am looking for rap god songs, if somebody else sings,  I directly move to the time where god sings}
{Big Sean killed this.}
{This nigga eminem said at 4:38 two penises FAF ( funny as fuck ) big IDFWU song fuckin sucked but this song got straight up bars from him but eminems best}
{I like your song}
{Eminem ate}
{Wats he saying? Anyways its good as love these lyrics dont really understand the 3rd}
{EminemVEVO has 10 letters, Detroit has 7. 10-7=3. What do we connect with the number 3? Right, A triangle! Illuminati confirmed?}
{Big sean and royce killed it, eminem was decent too, but Danny Brown... wtf?}
{Really impressed by Big Sean on this one. Did not knew he was that good!!}
{Dont rate it at all}
{"Just a step away from failing thats why they call it the D" dammmnn}
{Big Sean really coming up. He outrapped Em and Royce both imo on this.}
{eminem do what others think is a doll}
{New new York Vs. Everybody.... Asap Rocky, Issa Gold, Meechy Darko, Joey B4D4$$, Biggie's reincarnated soul     }
{Who is the short haired woman with downs mumbling shit in the chorus?  }
{“I'm Mr. Big Shot these bitches get drunk off me" In reference to Big Shot Billups... Detroit Pistons Finals MVP in 05... Sick shit}
{R.I.P Big Proof}
{😀}
{only good thing was royce honestly}
{There are not much instruments played in the song, but still the whole spectrum (20Hz -20Khz) is used creatively. How is that even possible? }
{Holy shit eminem crazy.... LEGENDARY}
{I wish twisted is the next video}
{Nobody in their right mind would say Eminem 'fell off' after witnessing him spit these bars. It's unbelievable how people think that. He slays most modern rappers with his weakest material. He's had high and low points in his career like any rapper, but he has always maintained some form of consistency with his lyricism. Eminem will never fall off.}
{Big Sean's verse killed it! }
{snoop tried to get the westside to do it no one wanted any part of it because of eminem}
{a jadore emi}
{*lel*}
{In my opinion, dej loaf and Danny brown ruined it for me.}
{EMINEM AHHHHH!#}
{Song would be 39% better if there was no Big Sean.}

{dam eminem is a fucking hard mc}
{Man big Sean sucked}
{only here for trick trick}
{Eminems  the best}
{Royce killed it}
{Royce!}
{minutes 4:00 rap god}
{I skipped to Eminem's part real quick}
{aye, got that rugby field at 2:17 doe}
{I love Em, and his flow on this was crazy good.  Not the best lyrical content, but he knows and shows how to spit it with flavour.  Royce for me was the best on this track.  Big Sean was...okay.  Got better near the end of the verse.  Best line for me was Danny Brown "They say my city's tougher than two fat b!+ches scissoring". lol. :D}
{eminem beast mode}
{I don't care if you like EM or not, a fan of him or not, but he's fucking the greatest rapper of all time, just accept it, and you people know it, i know how hard it is to admit he is. They are so many reasons why he is, but i can give a very few. 1) he sold more albums than any rapper worldwide, how? ( not cause he's freaking white, it's cause he's damn good, they are so many other white rappers in the industry, how come they can't sell as much as EM?)  2) Eminem is so good on so many levels, he's well rounded, his flow, and of course his lyrics. Freestyle, Eminem will shit on 99% of rappers including 2Pac and Biggie. His lyrics are just so raw and original. he can rhyme any word by breaking it down into syllables. his lyrics are so complex he cant be beaten, ever. No one comes close to his word skills. he uses a lot of homophones and homographs (words that mean more than one thing) in his songs. That's not something easy to do. (perfect example listen to eminem's verse in No love and Rap God), try to rap with the same flow and lyrics, let's see how easy that is comparing if you're trying to rap Pac's songs. 3) Let's be serious here, let Eminem rap 2Pac songs and let 2Pac rap Eminem's songs. Who you do think will do better? we all know how EM shit on rappers at their own song for most of the time.}
{0:52 they look like the younger version of my brother and sister }
{Royce Da 5'9:  Pretty good verse, nothing outstanding, but pretty quality. Big Sean: Bafd verse, bad lyrics, no flow, no effort or passion. Danny Brown: Pretty good, voice is weird, but its a decent verse.  Eminem: Probably the strongest verse along with Royce, but it's not among his best work.  Chorus: pretty good. Overall: 4/10, Not a bad song, but you feel opportunity was missed, Big Sean is horrible, Danny Brown is alright, but his verse is shorter then everyone elses and feels shoe horned in. Eminem and Royce Da 5'9 are the best two, but they are far from their top. }

{K}
{A lot of people are complaining about Em lately.. Of course he's not the same. Hes in his 40's now and a grown ass man. BUT one thing that is the SAME is he destroys the mic lyrically. Always has and always will. Just my opinion tho. - If anyone's just chillin out on youtube for a bit and wants to check some true meaningful hip hop, check me out and let me know what you think. Not trying to spam like everyone does tho, just sayin if your relaxing sittin back looking for something to do, check it out in my channel!﻿}

{I'm from Canada; when I was a kid I took a road trip down to Montreal with my dad. We went down to the states and up through Windsor to Montreal. Somehow, my dad got lost. We went into the heart of Detroit. Like the real thick of it. I saw things their I'll never forget. Bought some headphones in a bargain shop, did some laundry with people, looking at us like we don't belong there. lol Went to a gas station, two people fighting inside knocking down shelves. I needed to go to the washroom so we asked a mechanic if their was a washroom anywhere near by. You know what the response was? "Not in Detroit son!" Makes Winnipeg look real comfy.}
{Don't get me wrong im a big Eminem fan but Big sean MURDERED this shit!!!!}
{Süper Olmuş}
{he has nothing on Macklemore}
{I love Dej Loaf...I didn't know she was Detroit! <3}

{I didn't understand a single fucking word}

{Am I only one who thinks that Royce was the best? }
{What is the name the girl who sings at 00:01? }

{Fake eminem fans acts as If Every verse is Epic}
{Sean's verse >> Royce's verse >> Eminem's verse >> Danny Brown's verse (too short) Like the beat as well. Nice how the hook was short and served mostly as a transition between the verses.}
{Someone tell me a line From this Song that eminem said that was so epic? Eminem just have flows, lyrics not super GReat ya be overhyping his verses because his amazing flow  Like actually listen ik the dickrider em fans gon hate it but I just speak facts not.bias  Dude said his.verse legendary lmao}

{royce killed it like always.}
{Top 5 rappers. True Eminem- im not like a stan fan but i honestly think hes got the cleaverest rymes and best flow. Ever heard Bad Guy and the swim good verse 2pac- Enough said Nas- nas has got some of the best rymes out there no doubt, his flow is good but the lyrics id say are the best. Notorious B.I.G- Id say biggie is the king of rap. He really pushed for genre to be what it was back in the day, rapping about drugs and gangs and what it was like just trying to survive in the ghetto.  Jay Z- I really do think Jay Z is an outstanding artist, even others might not agree. I mean have you heard his stuff first coming up? Even now his songs arent bad. Now this next one i really hope you guys can agree. Hopsin- this guy is on some next level shit, i mean lyris and flow are outstanding, and he is not in it for the money. I really think he is up there with pac and em, dont believe me? give him a listen. Try RAW album first. Then his ill minds, then knock madness. THis has all been said except for hopsin being in the list, please if you give him a listen or youre his fan, thumbs this up so others can see.  Other honorable mentions Kendrick Lamar Easy E 50 Cent Lil wayne Gotchya}

{Is it bad I always skip to Eminem's verse?}
{how come do many people say they miss "Old Eminem"...? If you miss him meaning his old style, old songs then just go and listen to them sing it and get that ears' orgasm once again! just stop complaining about that...if you like or don't like his new creatures (as for me, i'd say they are master pieces as well, cause i haven't seen anybody who thinks 'Berzerk' or 'Rap God' are bad) it's still your choice and there's no need to inform everybody about your attitude to "New Eminem"...thank God he is still in the game!}
{3:00 since when the fuck did Don King start rapping}
{E-M-I-N-E-M ONE OF THE BEST OUF OUR ERA'S!!! THEY SHOULD HAVE DETROIT VS CHICAGO TWISTA,KANYE ETC!!}
{wtf}
{Look at his picture = illuminati confirmed}
{WTF !!}
{Em will always be the GOAT considering his early work! but it's not that he fell off, its just that before Encore his style sounded effortless and evil-genius-ish. now, his lyrics are still sicker than most but it feels like he's a rap robot! dont hate my opinion. Now let the hating begin}
{Romulus, Taylor, Inkster, plus Wayne It's got the City and County name Dearborn & Heights, Hamtramck, too D-Love shout out to all of you Hazel & Oak & AllenPark Ya'll ain't gettin' left in the dark Jeffries, Edsel, Fisher or Lodge, giving out a metaphorical D-Love massage special shout out to far lower East Side and to Woodbridge! we are Detroit, Detroit is us......we come from a place like no other... Maybe we sound aggressive, but I believe it's passion....... things just spoken about in a seemingly pissed off fashion.  Passion motivates us to practice and excel, in a place like the the D, seemingly designed to help us fail. But when you are trying to succeed and you ain't got no green and your car is breaking down but the buses smell like pee....and your trying to prevail, tryin' not to go to jail........... So it's stand in the hail, or try to scratch up the bail......but the ships about to sail, from the belly of the whale.  Just because we are so hard, doesn't mean that we are stale. Detroit has my love from the back or front of the action.  D-Love can't be measured in the form of a fraction.  I should add, I just, (meaning right now) spontaniously wrote this after watching the video to this song for the first time....I don't even know why I'm doing it...but I feel compelled...thought I was gonna type a few sentences, at most;  but this happened instead, somehow.........So, be gentle if you are gonna be hatin'.......If you've got the D-love then please thumbs up and or comment......maybe show/share some of your D-Love??????  Thank you to all the artists of all art forms who stay and represent Detroit.}
{Love Eminem , but man I hate stans , they are really annoying }
{Holy shit. Ems verse was amazing. You can see the passion he still has for music in his eyes man.  On a side note, ive noticed when on alot of the features he has with other artist, the beat changes or has something extra just for him.}

{1994: Bieber is born. 1995: Eazy E dies. 1996: Tupac dies. 1997: The Notorious B.I.G dies. Every year is a tragedy...﻿}

{this some true shit right here!}
{Hip hop de verdad. Royce el puto amo. Eminem fuera de este mundo, así de simple.}

{Eminem is shit, he spits like its coming from his anus. I could really see Young Thug and Lil wayne mixed together and still be better then Eminem.. pathetic }
{it's been a long time since i've heard this kind of rap, miss it <3}

{Needs more EMINEM, less royce da 5'9, but this beat is amazing!}
{he's body language is perfect :)}
{Soulja Boy killed it!}
{All I have to say is that Eminem needs to change how he raps. His music is all quick and sounds lame. Need some music that pumps you up like some of his old music. Putting too much out there without effort}

{Detroit vs Everyone huh? Seems we got a problem on our hands}
{moment when you read a comment that says white people only like eminem cause he's white. but i like him cause he has a great story behind his scene he has in most of his albums. and people say he still dresses like he's poor? that means he didnt want to change his style of clothing which means he doesnt want himself to change just because he has been getting progressively famous over time. he has already changed a bit but he is still good in certain songs. Respect em.}
{I live in Detroit turn up "detroit vs EVERYBODY" LOL}
{EMINEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEM AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE}

{Damn i'm checking the comments and.... seems like I'm the only one who love all the song, all the verses, all the rappers on this tracks are good, Period.}

Danny is making me doubt my english, bc i dont understand shit he's saying, Big is pretty good, Em is fucking breaking my brain with those damn amazing rhymes, but i dont understand why the instrumental is soo loud, i bearly hear the rap. chorus is pretty poor, did i already tell u about Danny ... Jesus ^-^ still great song.. good job Em you are the legend and the reason why i started rapping in the first place, Mr inspiration... and for that Thank you.}

{What the fuck happened in the 3rd verse? Did my computer malfunction?}
{There is No flow in this track}
{EM you are the best , !!!}
{Not gonna lie, this song got me hype as fuck. Royce absolutely destroyed that verse and finally getting the exposure he deserves. Sean had a creative cadence like always. I want to say Danny was good, but I wouldn't really know since I could barely understand what he was saying. And of course Em also destroyed, just like expected. I'm excited for the remix to see what the young Detroit guys have to offer.}

{It really pisses me off when people  start off with a comment that's actually relevant to the song and then they start promoting their channels.... If you can't get people to come to your channel legit don't go spam all over actually talented people's channels}
{You guys says: Danny brown verse: What???? Really, the verse in his letters is kind, very cool, because as voice is not so cool.}

{Usually don't comment...but damn this track is so good..I had to say something..}
{Types of Eminem fans (REVISED VERSION) If your an Eminem fan, let's face it your ass falls into one of these. 1. STANS- Die hard EM fans who vibe with his songs and have gone through similar shit as him. Who also believe EM is the greatest rapper alive despite his recent fuck ups. People who defend Eminem with their life.  2. SHADY FANS- Older fans who grew up as teenagers listening to his music. Fans who only like Eminem's songs from the 90's and shit on his newer songs. 3. FAKE FANS- This fanbase is composed of newer fans who obviously didn't grow up listening to Eminem, but just like his music because everyone else does. And to fit in.  4. DICK RIDERS-  Worshippers of Eminem. Basiclly just like Stans but on roids these kids, because typically immature have no sense when talking about Eminem online and believe every song eminem has put his name on hell even collaborations in that he was the best.}
{Yess. Detroit my city man}

{I like EM and Big Sean's verse}
{I was a extra in 8mile. Em would do his scene then be in a corner writing with headphones on zoned out. His daughter was young on the set. He's quiet to himself, but still had time in between takes to ask how you were doing. Cool guy. Shot out to all those guys & dej. This is huge for the city.}

{If these people really cared about their home city they would donate a lot of their money they make and give it to the community...}
{A lot of people are complaining about Em lately.. Of course he's not the same. Hes in his 40's now and a grown ass man. BUT one thing that is the SAME is he destroys the mic lyrically. Always has and always will. Just my opinion tho. - If anyone's just chillin out on youtube for a bit and wants to check some true meaningful hip hop, check me out and let me know what you think. Not trying to spam like everyone does tho, just sayin if your relaxing sittin back looking for something to do, check it out in my channel!﻿}

{I'm in college studying to become a journalist. The reason I want to become a journalist is because I love writing and I want to give people the truth! Today's media is filled with misleading headlines and vacuous, ambiguous stories. It seems like they're more interested in accumulating viewers and selling newspapers than actually reporting accurate news. I also make music with the same intent. I share my thoughts and feelings while, as rappers say, "keeping it real" lol Today's rap music is oversaturated with rappers who spit nonsensical jibberish and who are only in it for the money *cough cough lil wayne cough cough* It would mean a lot if you could give my music a listen! I just made a song about overthinking called "I Think My Thoughts Are Killing Me" and another song about high school called "Angry Adolescent". Feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks guys!

{sory guys tupac its not rap good rapgood its eminem}
{Listen : 1 it's very bad 2 it's bad 3 it's normaly  4 it's good 5 it's very good 6 fuck i love this song}
{Em your fans are so annoying. It doesn't matter if someone dislikes eminem, who the fuck cares? If you need reassurance that eminem is good and liked then you're not even a true fan / have some insecurity issues. I haven't liked anything he's done since TES- and that's okay, don't try and say i'm wrong for that lol Em will always be in my top 5 though.}
{Музыка клас}
{Кто русский ? }
{Royce killed it. Big Sean ruined it.}
{this is kinda similar to filipinos rap battles.}
{That was awesome !!}
{Em and big Sean killed it}
{Eminem !! Making black rappers look bad ~ .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. Since 1996 \!!!/}
{Big Sean, Eminem and Royce are beast then there's 3 shit people who cant even sing or rap !!!!!!!!!!! }
{GO TO RUSSIA 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺}
{im sorry im the bad...}

{It cool}
{Rip it man}
{D town weak ass hell}
{Похоже на Beatles - Help!}
{Hey EEEEEEM !!!  I love youuuu !!!! <3}
{they say no one is perfect bt nowadays no one is perfect except Eminem}
{Big sean is nice in this people don't listen to him properly everyone just comments on eminem}
{Expect a duet with Ceza ! }
{EMINEM the Best Rapper Of the World }
{2nd verse ain't shit}
{epic!}
{Eminem is still amazing but I suggest Tech N9ne if you're looking for the Rap God. And for those "Shady the only rapper I listen too" kind of people Eminem is on the Anthem with him and is soon to be on Speedom (If this is the right name for WWC2)with him in his new Album Special Effects}
{Is that Jaden Smith doing the intro for this video? }
{Detroit vs. Everybody }
{6 minutes of my life ill never get back}
{big sean killed it, here i am thinking hes got no lyrics and then he drops the fuckin bomb... this mans growing as an artist for sure. not even gonna bother to comment on the other shit}
{Jesus man every verse was just amazing}
{Even when I get my dick stuck in my pants zip I still sound better and less offbeat than Danny brown and big sean combined .}
{He still has it.}
{think danny brown had the best verse}
{lol people who say eminem is better then 2pac or big need to listen to me against the world life after death, hell nwa and ice cube are better then em}
{Woah whattt! No way they put all these artists together ...nice job!}
{Danny Brown just fucking too beast man}
{lol I love Danny Brown}
{}
{Man Wtf Is this!? Eminem just destroyed that.!}
{}
{Also can I just throw out there that just cause Eminem is someone's favorite rapper doesn't immediately make them a Stan. The guy honestly is one of the best and is my favorite but, I still have mad respect for Nas, The Notorious B.I.G, Big Pun, Tupac, Tech N9ne, Hopsin, Wu Tang, N.W.A, The Beastie Boys, Mobb Deep or any number of guys rapping right now. I listen to tons of the before mentioned's music but Em is honestly still my favorite. I just wanted to throw that out there because when ever some one say to me "Who's the best?" Or "Who's your favorite" I get labels as a Stan and it's unfair because I know a large amount of people like myself who love rap as a whole but get labeled "posers" or "Stans" because we like Eminem the most. There is a reason why he's popular the guy has real talent and regardless of if you like his new sound his lyrics are still some of the best.}
{Sounds like something Jon Lajoie would write, I think he is awesome}
{This comment has taken its toll on my pride and that was just the thought of writing it. Anyway I've one rap on my page and I would really appreciate it if you could take a look and let me know what you think. I'm irish and I live in a village that is predominantly Gaelic Football Hurling Farming and alcoholics so rap is not the route I was expected to go but it's my passion I love it so please watch listen and let me know what you think. Again I apologise this was a last resort mission thank you.}
{I really like this song and the Shady XV off the album the rest if the album I could take or leave honestly.}
{Can all the bitchy cunts stop commenting about who's a better rapper and comment about the fucking video.}
{Fuck Detroit}
{Who here is actually from Detroit}
{Eminem: Yo Sean.. I think we need Dej Loaf on the chorus. Big Sean: Definitely.. Let's pay her.}
{@Kill Strake  try hopsin or logic}
{New York should respond: Jigga, Joey Badass, Nas, A$AP, Fabolous, Ghostface & Busta. Then L.A should respond to that with: Kendrick, Ab Soul, Kid Ink, Game, Tyler the Creator, Hopsin & YG. Then Canada should respond with Drake & Logic cause that's all they got lmao. No really though there should be competition would make things more entertaining.}
{big sean is wack}
{:-D}
{Not gonna lie this song goes so hard}
{Dafuq is Danny Brown saying?}
{I left a comment yesterday on here to some guy claiming nas was better then em.       I suggested a song that em raps in tounge , the hardest language in the world to learn. I said the song was amityville but was wrong its the 1st "American psycho" off of Devils Night.}
{eminem was okayish in this song not so good but Danny brown killed,I heard him first time and I think his verse and flow was the best}
{2,585 can suck it!! Thumbs up for this!}
{wtf was that fool with the frizzy hair saying lol}
{I love this video! !  Great song.}
{eminem was in dis song to make the rest of them famous}
{Damn this shit is heavy}
{this shit type weak. Em had a good verse doe..}
{this beat is so trash.}
{way to gooo }
{This song wouldn't be shit without EMINEM}
{I m a eminem fan since the slim shay LP, and i love his new songs even MMLP2, but this song will be better without him, yeah is really sad but is the true}
{big sean did g.o.o.d i like his verse}
{not a bad song, but not that great. Production is so average.}
{Danny Brown stole the spotlight on this one. Only one to really rap about Detroit. "They say my city tougher than two fat bitches scissorin" - best line of the whole song.}
{idc what anyone says the new Eminem i respect even more. at his peak was 1999-2003 but for him to make a change in his life and mature, and be able to still relate with millions of people makes him the greatest rapper of all time. take skin color outta it, forget he's white n listen to songs like dead wronng, and even love the way u lie. his lyrics are disgusting n idc what people say he's the goat.}
{Who wants to see  #Eminem  Singing 3:39 He finishs At  5:17 Total = 3:56 ... It means Eminem Crushes The Score Right here....}
{Listen to eminem's new song}
{Listen to eminem's new song}
{Eminem fucking gets down your the shit!!}
{Brown is the goat}
{es una vena eminem}
{Anyone hear the AP comment lmao}
{Danny Brown was my fav in this}
{DOPE SONG}
{like if you like eminem:D}
{Also, song should have ended at 3.40 }
{This beat is a direct sample from James Brown - Funky Drummer, I like how often you still hear that.}
{Danny Brown is DOPE}
{No Xzibit??? Thats disrespectful}
{the best}
{Жалкое подобие на рекламу Газон NEX}
{Big Sean honestly had the best lines but eminem had a better flow. }
{I don't care what anybody says Eminem is and always will be Rap God}
{royce da 5'9 he looks like chico beans from wild n out}
{Drake is the dirt under eminems nails and lil wayne is the tissue em wipes his jizz with}
{That awkward guy with the glasses ruined it...}
{Woow big sean sucks ass, i like his song "Ashley" but hes just a lame rapper..}
{Eminem should have retired he's a joke now}
{So many rappers from Detroit who should be on this song and weren't...}
{Big sean = best verse}
{Ight should be an easy fight}
{still better than lil wayne and co}
{1COOOOOL }
{Good visuals}
{}
{Danny Brown! Dubs up! Dope song!}
{Best song ever}
{uhh that ,cool song}
{The Truthh Fuck What Errbody else say}
{Big sean is too hard}
{This is one of eminems only decent songs that he released lately , rap god and monster were pretty bad and so were most songs on the marshall mathers lp 2 but some were actually pretty good}
{The whole track Royce da 5'9 got the hardest bars}
{nice nem!}
{I think Danny Brown and Dej Loaf have got such anoying voices}
{Dear god Danny Brown is whack as hell. }
{love you all guys !1!}
{That is the ugliest fucking dog..}
{Ну хоть шоколад молочком разбавили ;D}
{I really hope you guys understand this isn't about Eminem,he took a backseat to let other people shine. IF you knew anything about him,you would know he's entering his Dre phase. Meaning eventually he will stop rapping and find him an undiscovered artist and groom him/her}
{Trick Trick does almost nothing in this song}
{ok added this song to my "best eminem songs ever" list :D i like shadyXV Guts of Fear Rap God Till i Collapse Won't Back Down Survival The Real Slim Shady Lose yourself (ofcourse!!! :D) and this one}
{Eminem is by far my favorite rapper, and in my opinion the greatest rapper of all time.... With that said, way too many people sleep on Royce da 5'9". He is seriously the only rapper who could have managed to stay on Em's level for an entire album and he shreds it in every slaughterhouse. Joe Budden's pretty underrated too}
{5'9" killed his verse}
{Maybe I am only 14 , but I'm a true fan of Marshal aka Eminem}
{he's not in his 20s anymore, there's no more slim shady.. just fuckin get over it.. }
{In my opinion I like welcome to Detroit better than this}
{Again a awesome song!}
{who is the first rapper}
{}
{Eminem, the number 1.... While all those rappers like Nicki Minaj and Drake are just editting their voice alot, and Nicki only gets money with her ugly ass... Eminem is a real rapper... since his carrerr started. One reason is because he is just like the 90 rappers... They didn't gave a fuck about Music video's. Rappers were better those days, but all the rappers in this clip and especially Eminem did great!!!! Eminem number 1..... everyone can call him a stupid fucktard... But you don't know what the fuck Em's been trough, so yeah.... go hate on Nicki or something...}
{My nigga Royce}
{Sei sempre un grande!!!!!!!!}

{#Eminem  Man U just Awesome}
{Big Sean had the best verse...anyone says different is hatin.}
{Вот так вот, зато на войну миллиарды тратят, а на свой город и людей денег нет, печаль...про Украину во истину}

{Stan ! ! ! ! ! !}
{Wish he connected with clear soul forces/gas mask/black milk/phat kat and slum village wih D12... Thats detroit right there!!! This comn from a fan in New Zealand.}
{Great verses from all parties. Eminem's flow is so on point. }
{Who is the guys who sounds like busta rhyme on meth?}
{Please don't make music like this Eminem, you've done some really good songs but this is going back to some really bad garbage of just being cocky and bragging about how good you are. I like your shit that people can relate to and gives the feels.}
{I listen Eminem, he is awesome, but this track suck balls as fuck.}

{Detroit vs Everybody! more like Eminem vs Everybody }
{EMINEM <3 <3 <3}
{damn no calicoe :( }
{This is good but.... go listen to Pro Era, Logic and Dizzy Wright}
{Some of you don't have enough skills to judge how Em raps. If you're a rapper, you should be tolerance and respect each rapper. We were born differently so our tastes in music are different also. I guess this will never stop as people keep commenting negatively. It seems like you pay attention more to your least favorite rappers than to your most favorite rappers :) It must be hard for you to just listen to your favorite ones instead of your hated ones and complain about it. So ironic :)}
{Royce killed it.. Eminem tho.. killed it, revived it, and killed it again. Damn}
{Just put my first song on youtube it would be cool if you guys checked it out}
{I thought Dej Loaf was a boy the first time I heard her 😭}
{oh I get it now, Detroit has something in the water that makes good rappers....yeah I'm the smartest in the family ^_^}
{Oh Fuck😍}
{I fucks wit eminem just like everyone else and his verse was mos def dope but yall niggas trippin if you don't think big sean had the best verse on this song. He knew he had to come hard being on a song with royce and eminem and he did. Stop being stans and actually listen to what he was saying.}
{Eminem is just like any other "great at his profession" celeb. Even if something is mediocre they just get the benefit of the doubt & rounded up to it was great lol smh. I think it was just a normal decent verse nothing to go too crazy over but that's just me}
{So,how did trick trick get listed as a rapper on this song?He talked at the end.That's it!}
{ em men  em cray  hip hop dancer from peterbough  moust respeted  ondeinnf if I be in one of your videos}
{I like Adrian Peterson and the Vikings but I've been listening to Eminem forever so if I had to chose... EMINEM!}
{Sum people think u click the button to see em but when u do u find out he's wack as fuck.. Ever since he came out the closet he's been lame}

{might be wierd, but, never saw this guy: 2:55, gotta hear more of him. }
{Welcome 2 Houston}
{Hip hop Is still alive with a slow heartbeat}
{I capital Hate Eminem all he does is swear and rap about the same stuff its stupid listen all people sing about is sex,drugs,money,violence its dumb what ever happened to the old rap it was ok know its all the same just saying its dumb to me }
{Big Sean and Eminem killed that}
{Eminem's verse was a little disappointing. Royce and Big Sean were excellent though. And i couldn't understand wtf danny brown was saying...}
{Hey hey hey girls can rap too}
{#WheresLogic?}
{Also to get the true feelin of Detroit u need the street representation as well as the soul. I wish J. Dilla was still here to produce the beat.}
{LISTEN! EM is top 5 all time but I think sometimes he is OVER-LYRICAL especially n recent music. Royce to me is under appreciated for what he brings to the game. Danny Brown is ok but I probably wouldve put some one else on in his spot possibly the battle rapper Calicoe. Big Sean  is witty today's Mc's kind of fall within that style. It's dope!!}
{Top 5 best rappers 1. Lil Wayne  2.Snoop Dogg 3.Young Thug 4.Easy E 5.The Game}
{danny brown looks like marshawn lynch lmao}
{Every rap eminem collabs with-  First 2 minutes- Kids who think theyre cool and like these rappers who cant rap about anything other than sex and drugs and then the final minute eminem comes in and actually makes the rap worth listening to.}
{GROSO}
{Hey guys Reporter:people are saying lil Wayne was sent by the rap god Eminem:I don't remember sending anybody}
{beginning killed Dej Loaf <3}
{I just stopped here to say, Em's still got it after almost 20 years on stage.. his rhymes are still razor sharp, tcha gotta admit it ;)}
{I give Big Sean credit he has the 2nd best verse he flowed very well with the beat and had good metaphors, but anyone who actually listens to rap and not just bobs their head to the beat can see Eminem had the best verse he rhymed  almost every word very rapidly while still flowing to the beat very well and telling a story. Lyrically Eminem had the best verse Big Sean the best flow to the Beat}
{big sean gave a nigga chills}
{I think Danny Brown killed it the most,  dope shit}
{eminem n1}

{All of these rappers suck donkey peepee.}
{this is what quality mean! Awesome!!}

{Royce is obviously the star..besides em}
{Wow ! Nuff Said}
{Detroit for ever}

{HELLO FROM RUSSIA}
{This is better than MMLP2 was.  Apart from rap god and few other good hits. Nowadays I'm more of a Strange Music fan. Hopefully Em is going to be in next Worldwide Choppers track or something. Tech N9ne, Hopsin and Eminem, now that's a trio I would love to hear on the same track.}
{I really like the wacky haired one is good too}
{Although the second rapper is sorta good}
{Only eminem is a good rapper the others just say stuff}

{ЭМИНЕМ ПОГНАЛИ В РОССИЮ, СУКА!!!}
{Well , Just That's it :'( , I'm the fan who listened to eminem a year ago , but i loved Eminem more than any other rapper but Eminem now is 42 years old and he's about to Retire :'( and Eminem fans and views are getting decreased until There's no Eminem , but still in our minds that eminem is the best rapper ever , and NO DOUBT FOR FUCKING HATERS , but don't forget Not Afraid which rocked you in your place and got 500,000,000 Views till today and Rap God in which he said 101 words in 16 Seconds .. All of that was thrown ?  Eminem songs aren't dying anyway , and someone said Eminem has the most annoying fans ever , well this is right and i have the enough effort remind everyone on every artist channel :p , But i want to ask some questions and i will give an answer , Why Eminem is getting down exactly his fans are getting down (lesser) , that is because he is talking about his life ? about real things in the world ? he became rapper to provide us with the armor that can stands for any situation he faced in his life , Not about Sex but to be honest like 10% he was singing like every rapper , Sorry for My English , I'm not very good in English  #SupportEminem    #EminemRapGod   }
{ADD ME :7E600BBC }
{Nice song but why "versus" ? I mean enough of the negativism and hatred, this world needs some love...}
{Be Interesting!}
{I like the girl voice}
{Big Sean ripped these motherfuckers a new asshole they too competitive on a calm track it's a thing to be lyrical but on the right track they heads get too big and a few fans gas them up it's bullshit! Shit sound just like when wu tang go overboard with wordplay on a average track slow down and do the beat and the people justice for real!}
{i think its funny my first reaction to listening to this song was to fast forward to EM's part. King among kings!!}
{[Eminem destroys] Everybody}
{grandioso!!!!}
{grandioso!!!!}
{If only trick trick wrapped up the song with a verse at the end. Would have been perfect.}
{How does pewdiepiepie have more subs then eminem}
{Ok disaster 13 go play some em,tupac,and big and hear the lyrics and then come back and tell me who kills it .? Ready go}
{Any suggestions for more rappers?  I really enjoy Eminem.  But I've tried a few Tupac, Biggie, etc songs and I can't really get into the old school stuff :/}
{The song begins in 3:39}
{Rap god .....eminem.....}
{Am I the only one that wants to stab their ear drums when Danny brown starts rapping? The guys voice is horrendous...}
{Eminem plz don't stop making music I'm going through a tuff Time your the only thing keeping me going don't stop plz😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎}
{Eminem never stop making music}
{Eminem is Eminem shadys still here but he taken a brake Eminem you are a some and here to bring you back I don't want to see you leave rap so what I say here is not true it for you can get started agian OK reddy go you stupid raper that dad noting but rap like crap and will never be good and you can suke it        K get hoped dude come on all that for you I want Eminem bake the real Eminem}
{till 3:38 it was all ok ..bit lagging but then on woa it was just awe..somethin EMINEM ur the man the next 3 mins were flowin prod to  be a stan}

{dinero dinero dinero aprende algo dinero, no hay error no hay error mi madre levita y evita un puñetaso en mi cara papapau rusia rusia rusia soy un comandante un perro andante cada vez que soy elegante no hay error papapau}
{Why categorize the fans. You all clearly like the same rapper if you're a fan of him? Sure the reasons you listen to him but dividing up the community of Em's , and any rapper for that fact isn't accomplishing anything. Is common interest not a thing anymore or do people really think themselves higher than others? Anyways I really hope to see his community and fans unite in support of him instead of arguing amongst themselves. Oh and I came for Royce, great song.}
{Would like to hear Eminem coöperate with MGK!}
{I havent heard any Eminem in a few years, but now I see he is still killing it. }
{Eminem I love your music! Please slow it down a bit. You are faster now than you were. When i grew up with you I had time to process what you said partially in my head because you said it slightly slower. Further you told a story in your songs which made it easier to follow especially when said a tiny bit slower. That had huge effect on me.}
{Сразу захотелось посмотреть 8 Милю }
{this track needed OBIE TRICE!}
{eminems part,the best <3}
{SICK!!! just disappointed OBIE TRICE wasn't in it}
{he went insane and attacked the babysitter with a potato piller lmao}
{As long as it took Sean to get a eminem collaboration dej loaf got one already lol I wonder how that makes him feel}
{EMINEM is the hip hop king !! Awesome song bro}
{I think Eminem has LONG since forgotten about what made him so great in the past.}
{Eminem, still the most "musical" rapper of 'em all.}
{I honestly thought Dej Loaf was a prepubescent boy.. whoops}
{the best rapper is eminem }
{i only came for danny brown.}
{Alright so to be straight up if you don't like eminem fuck you, you are such a hater he raps about not being afraid, determination, and showing no fear and if you can't respect that you must be brainwashed by every other rapper talking about getting high and getting money why do you think eminem is the best rapper he picked up right where bigge and 2pac left off, I listen to other rappers so I am not a fanboy of em I respect what he has done for rap. Also you can talk about him not being as good as he was well then your not a true fan eminem has nothing else to prove he has done his part soon he will be gone and rap will never be the same so just enjoy it please.}
{Eminem killed it.}
{Big Sean murked that}
{Eminem it's back. Yaho-o-o!}
{Eminem sounds the same in all his songs.}
{Em fell off... He cares about speed, not content. Just like when he was a kid. It's just a disappointment. I miss the sick-ass explicit flow, the new shit just straight up blows. He literally at the same level as the rappers that only talk about hos. But I guess that maybe that's just how the shit goes.  Fuck, I can't even do it now.}
{Sick}
{hi}
{Sean please don't work with these trash artist}
{I never knew i would say this, but Big Sean has really matured as an artist. I love it when rappers reach their realistic potentials. I think he bodied this track. Great delivery an cadence. I enjoyed Em's verse, but he needs to go back to what made him so famous all of those years ago. Slower delivery, a hint of humour and a flawless flow. What he's spitting now is just lyrical acrobatics, it's kind of taken a but of his flow out from his delivery. Dope track though, Detroit will always be one of the main hubs of hiphop thanks to Em}
{Eminem killed it. Everyone else sucked}
{Finally...the video is out... sweet..}

{Its a good song dont hate  1.its got good base}
{Crack!}
{BIG SEANS VERSE IS DOPE. HE KILLED THAT SHIT}
{There's no denying Eminem is a lyricist. His style stands out to me more than other rappers. It reminds me of Elijah Linkz. They would be good on a track together.}
{Eminem es el amo}
{why is eminem so loud now?}
{Well, this is awesome. Those guys're really, really cool.}

{Danny Brown!!!!😃😃😃😃}
{Eminem is the best rapper no focking rapper can deal whit Eminem}
{the best eminem}
{what the fuck happened Eminem}
{Rap for Eminem he is the best ever ever. Im big fan of Eminem.}
{Is EMINEM the best ? EMINEM is a person that he can make rhymes in his head so fast. Eminem never lets nobody put him down. he fights for what`s right, and he will always do staff that is right,}
{The real question is, who had control verse?}
{Big Sean should get booted off the island. foreal!}
{Man, in comment section is Stan vs Everybody  Stans do you even listen eminem musics or just listen lose yourself ? fucking cancers }
{Eminem is not better than nas or kendrick lamar}
{}
{@eminem U r just unbeatable artist...!!!}
{ill tell you all who eminem is he is the reason im here now he is the reason i want to be a rapper when i grow up i will do it}
{Any 'fan' who says he fell off is just idiotic. You just have to listen to this for proof. He is the greatest rapper alive.  I have to also give Royce credit because he killed it.}
{Danny Brown ROCKS! Fucking awesome!}
{EMINEM by far the best wtf}
{Look up, jak08y raps fast! You're welcome!}
{Who's that woman mumbling words in a horrible voice...}

{Danny Brown had killed it!  However that last verse wasn't that good﻿}
{Love it! Covered it! And yes I'm a chick!}
{норм}
{I thought Royce and Sean killed it}
{I have read all}
{Lethal Cypher. Looks like Calicoe beside trick trick. Detroit r FIRE! Great track. }
{Feel like Royce was the best in the song. Em was great lyrically but I felt his flow didn't rly work with the song felt like he was trying to emulate his rap god bit  too much. The other guys were mehl}
{I like the fact that everyone on this track and video all represent there city to the fullest and represent it from a different perspective. And the fact that each of there verses sound nothing alike is a very Detroit thing when it comes to hip hop from that city. There is a slew of artists from Detroit who have various styles and work a lot together and represent Detroit. Pass and Present.  Black Milk Guilty Simpson Esham Invincible Trick Trick D12 Aretha Franklin(She still lives in Detroit) Iggy Pop Kid Rock JDilla  Slum Village Elizhi To name a bunch. And Lots More. Male and Female.}

{they finally filmed the video for this}
{did eminem just get renegaded by big sean? yes....yes, he did}
{Hi guys! Can you please take a minute and listen to our music? It would mean the world to us. Let us know what you think. Thank you very much}
{What does he mean by " my homie wanted a chevy, so I put my dog in the vet" ?}
{Ems verse was pretty bland.Like now everybody is just used to these rapid lines.Royce was extremely good,glad he's making good music}
{Big Sean kills it along side Royce and Em.....idk what that other guy was doing :/}
{These comments really piss me off sometimes. Everyone killed it in the song, not just em. They all deserve credit. Great vid tho.}
{Thoughts on the TRACK itself not each rappers background. But Royces verse was alright I still liked it but hes had better verses, Big Sean caught me off guard with his verse and really impressed me ALOT. Dej Loaf (tbh at first i thought they couldve got someone else to do that chorus) but Im actually starting to like the chorus. Trick Trick caught me off guard too and was just like "what the hell?" I think he tried to hard to be honest. Fast flow, but kinda awkward. Eminem basically helped recovery the song back from Trick Trick. And in all honesty, the flow Em had in this video was one of my favorites compared to the others. A "just gonna throw a sick verse down then leave style is what I like from Em.}
{Who is the new "Bizarre" guy in the new D12? Never mind. Don't care.}
{It doesn't matter whose on the track. Detroit needs help obviously.}
{I dunno about the others but for me Danny Brown killed it. I really liked it}
{Everyone talking bout em on here and aint even payin no mind to how big Sean spazzed out smh}
{kmt. in terms of flow and lyrics, its eminem by far. him then big sean and then royce. although big sean didnt really start until the last part of his verse. the other dude after big sean is crap.}
{Black Milk shoulda been in this who agrees?.....}
{good song}
{Peace & Love from Rhonda London Ferguson.  I mean i want to see you, meet you.  Find me i'm family.......................}
{Loving the rap culture.}
{I wish pac and biggie were still alive turn we'd have 3 of the best rappers in one game! Just imagine them collaborating on a song and the variety of real rap to listen too}
{OKAY CHICAGO WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE??!  But actually, I'd die to see this take off, various cities battling it out.}
{This is the shit}

{I am your big fan  Eminem}
{I'm a big fan of Em, I hate when people only come to a song to listen to him. Although this song, he definitely got the best flow and wordplay on this song}
{Do you wanna ride or die... La la la la la la la. Come with me!}
{Really feeling Danny Brown. Hes got some sick lyricism even if his voice isn't the best}
{This is like a cypher}
{this song go}
{I really like Em and other rappers but oh man....all these 14 years old saying "oh im 14 and i listen 2 eminem hes tha best" you know what? Shut up. I'm freakin 15 and oh god I don't say on every video "im 15 and listening to this" you all need to shut up you're not better thant everyone one. I listen to classical music, Beatles,Tech N9ne. I'm not better than everyone else. It's music. It's made to make you feel things. Not be a f*ckin prick.}

{Stream InfiniteMC Pred 1 mesecem (urejeno)   When Eminem leaves the game, there will be not a single man or woman on earth that wont feel it. If you understood that he IS becoming older and has matured then you would see that he really is "better" as a human. Even if you think that Eminem fell off you have to admit... EVEN DRE (Who is respected as the scout for talent) fell off and produced a few songs that are "good" but they where very mainstream (Kush, sex, money, famous, NONSENSE). If you haven't noticed Eminem (In recent years) hasn't rapped about drugs or killing people or his bad relationships. If you notice closely, this song is (in my point of view) one of Eminem's best because he is admitting that he is getting old and that he has matured ("Id rather make Not Afraid 2 than another motherfucking we made you") and his mentality has changed. In my point of view "Rap God" is a good song that shows his talent as a rapper...                                       |>BUT<|  (Guts Over Fear, Legacy, Bad Guy, Evil Twin, Monster, ETC.) talk about how he got to where he is and how he understands his demons. He knows he is getting old and running out of good ideas for lyrics ("But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone? And the lights go out in that trailer park?"). He understands that the public has stopped believing in him because that "Light" and the "spark" of hate that he had with him when he began his career is leaving him ("And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun"). His lyrics are softer now because he has understood that life is full of hardships and that we shouldent take it out on others when it could also be his fault. The angry blond will live on in our hearts as long as we keep it there...                         |>BUT<|  We HAVE to realize that slim shady is his DEMON, created by all the hate and mistreatment that he received ("Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt just having to balance my dang self but on eggshells I was made to walk but thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the strength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium at least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done") and that this "Monster" inside him is what made him famous. He WILL NOT go back to that persona and "Monster Feat. Rihanna " explains that. Another example of how Eminem has matured. Listen to the last verse of "Bad Guy" EVERY PART OF THAT VERSE is just incredibly true. Marshall spits his heart out on that verse. It made me cry. Eminem is in pain, he has seen everything that he has done, all of the national hatred that he inspired. All of the bad things rap has done to him. He talks about how he is living a nightmare full of remorse but he wants to keep his fame ("I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in When they say all of this is approaching its end But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again") He also talks about how he has a ("I am your lack of a conscience") lack of a conscience and that he understands that the game controlled his life and now the game is telling him that his round is up but he don't want to go. ("I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow") There are so many more messages in that last verse of "Bad Guy" that I can explain here. Look for "Eminem - Bad Guy [The Epic "Verse 4"]" and dissect the lyrics and their meaning. That verse is by far the most powerful verse ANY MC has ever spit. Hands down. But most of all he thanks us... He thanks world because he understands that even in tough times, we are his "Soldiers up in his corners" we are (to him) worth more than a Grammy or any award. (Unlike rappers now adays, Nicky Minaj for example wrote "Fuck all you skinny bitches" What the fuck is up with rap now a days?). Eminem wrote this song for world the REAL fans that understand him! ("So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted, I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song and everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more from this day forward, just let them a-holes talk take it with a grain of salt.") When Eminem leaves the game, there will be an emptiness in my heart that will never be filled. Eminem, your TRUE fans are still here and we arn't leaving. I still believe in you. AND I DON'T THINK HE WILL EVER LEAVE US HE EVEN WROTE IT IN A SONG HE WILL STAY IN THE GAME TILL DEATH :D.... i have a biggest respect to him really amazing work :)}

{A lot of people are complaining about Em lately.. Of course he's not the same. Hes in his 40's now and a grown ass man. BUT one thing that is the SAME is he destroys the mic lyrically. Always has and always will. Just my opinion tho. - If anyone's just chillin out on youtube for a bit and wants to check some true meaningful hip hop, check me out and let me know what you think. Not trying to spam like everyone does tho, just sayin if your relaxing sittin back looking for something to do, check it out in my channel!﻿}

{I'm gonna be honest. Em did good like everyone else in this song, but Royce fucking towers over Em in this.}
{Everybody says eminem is dead but no eminem is in this video alive so anybody who made videos that said eminem was dead was wrong}
{Danny Brown had the best verse, opinion of mine of course.  Big Sean is so mediocre, and has no energy, its just boring to listen to.  Eminem does what he always does, and Royce was good too.  Chorus could have been better  "Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River" Best line of the song }
{Who is this Eminem guy everyone keeps commenting about. I came here for Danny brown}
{When they stopped manufacturing cars, they started manufacturing words.}
{For some strange reason, most don't like to admit that Eminem is the greatest LIVING emcee. Isn't it strange how most of the rappers out there that most listeners put before Eminem think he's number 1. }
{Is Big Sean standing in the abandoned Packard plant for his verse?}
{BIG SEAN had the best verse TBH}
{The RaP GOD will never get old . Eminem , this guy never stops . ;:::::}

{whatever it is they're super cool. their rap skills are awesome. I crushed on big sean.}
{I love this song}
{If you fucktards don't like eminem then don't see his videos and don't hear his music.}
{I'm a hardcore EMINEM fan, but I can't doubt that in this video, Royce was the one that killed this.}
{People complaint about eminem's fanbase, then why dafuq do you come on his videos and comment about how he sucks or fell off....}
{My dog wanted that chevy so I put my dog in the vet ohh shit}

{Only verse that gets skipped on here is big Sean ...}
{LIKE IF YOUR WATCHING 2015 (shit this vid came out 2015)}
{Everyone's here blabbing about Eminem like that's the only thing that matters. Damn, I'm sitting back just like that was one of the best videos and songs I've heard. Mostly because I can appreciate a group of people who have absolute, true loyalty to their roots. That's what this song is about, while putting Detroit on the map of course. Everyone just murdered that shit... Mad props to Big Sean for putting out bangers on bangers lately too! That Blessings, IDFWU, and this shit...Detroit may have some of the best rappers I think.}
{Whos that kid in the beginning}
{Eminem's chopping.was the longest I have ever heard by any Rapper. Though they was no rhythm change but so long going on and on. Amazing. And 5"9's verse is crystal maaan. Thumbs up for Big Sean Don and that another sick crazy MC.}

{I don't really understand how people can possibly say eminem's only successful cuz he's white or say that he's overrated. He's the greatest rapper of all time IN MY OPINION.He's WAY better than both biggie and pac. Eminem's always inspired me, he's a huge inspiration to me. I'm a 16 year old rapper that earned 2,000 subscribers in less than a year. Check a couple of my songs out and tell me what you guys think!﻿}

{This is honest criticism: Eminem snapped, like i mean if you go look up his lyrics for his verse youll be amazed with his wordplay. But global wise, and vibe wise, Big Sean had the best verse on this song, and will be the verse everybodys gonna wanna spit. To me, i think Em shouldve slowed it down and let niggas really hear everything he had to say, like a lot of ppl dont really wanna have to work to the extreme to try to understand your lyrics even though we know the shit is hot. Big Sean's delivery had swag, meaning, power, symbol, and i felt Detroit all thru his vibe. I understood his message and it was dope asf! If you disagree than so be it, Ima Eminem fan been one since dayone, but i have to say i was more impressed with Big Sean's flow rather than Em's in this one. #DetroitVsEverybody}
{Royce was best on this imo}
{banging tune !!!!!!!!!!!!!:)}

{Quit talking about how rap should be or how fans should be, are you going to teach Eminem how to rap? listen and SHUT UP}
{I hate people are arguing over Eminem falling off and selling out. Most of the people who say this only know about his pop singles, which is sad. I personally like Eminem in each stage of his evolution as an artis and I think that he is back at the top of his game right now, because his lyricism and flow are just INSANE. This song is the perfect example. If you notice on every album he puts out, he has one or two pop hits and the rest of the singles are mostly pure emotion and rap. Please, guys.}
{Holy shit, i know I'm gonna sound like a fan boy but fuck it Eminem goes so damn hard}
{Marshall the best in all time!}
{Eminem the new or the old  Both are good Fuck you if you think im wrong}
{Why didn't Em choose Obie Trice instead of Danny Brown. That dude ruined the entire song!!!}
{Я практически ничего не понимаю из текста. Отчасти из-за того, что очень плохо владею английским языком, отчасти из-за паранормальной скорости чтения Эминема =)Но, я уже многие годы уверена, что этот парень - просто невероятен!! Здоровья тебе, удачи и вдохновения! :* I almost do not understand the text. Partly due to the fact that it is very bad speak English, partly because of the paranormal reading speed Eminem =) But, for many years I am sure that this guy - just incredible !! Health to you, good luck and inspiration! *}

{Кто здесь русский? 👍}
{Big Sean verse gets boring}
{The Song Starts At 3:40}
{Im not from Detroit, but I understand this.}
{Big Sean actually raps pretty good in this track.I'm really surprised}
{ I don't really  understand how people can possibly say eminem's only successful cuz he's white or say that he's overrated. He's the greatest rapper of all time IN MY OPINION.He's better than both biggie and pac. Eminem's always inspired me, he's a huge inspiration. I'm a 16 year old rapper that earned 2,000 subscribers in less than a year. Check a couple of my songs out and tell me what you guys think!﻿}
{Not of this planet!Amazing 🇮🇹}
{well people,i think that from the time eminem sings,it's the best part of song}
{I have no idea what Danny brown said}
{Slim had the worst verse}
{Respect from Macedonia!!!! <3 <3 <3 }
{It's just....... Not the same anymore :( I know time changes, but Eminem's lyrics and flow is just.... Meh??? Even his voice has changed alot... In a bad way.}
{Eminel the best moment music}
{ems verse has to be one of the best off all time}
{lol this is terrible beat is wack af ill stick to turn up and drill this is so wack}
{The guy before Eminem sucks hard. So irritating voice.}
{all i can see is u Eminem <3}
{Danny sounds like one of them poor guys in hardcore pawn.. Why do people like him?}
{Its Impressive that Eminem still has the best verse on the whole track. Big Sean had a great verse though but Eminem went all in to prove he's still one of the best!}
{かっけーーーーーー}
{3:39 - EM COMES IN. Your Welcome.}
{This shit is dope !! 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥}
{Did Trick Trick jus' ask Em to take this song and let his hoodlums spit on it? Hahahaha}
{Proof dissed Royce Da 5'9". Em makes feat with Royce Da 5'9". Proof wouldnt be happy about this...}
{Eminem has definitely not slipped off the tracks , if you think about it , his wordplay is heaps better how he rhymes one word with 50 others and make them all rhyme in a short space of time , in my opinion he's the best rapper that has ever lived , I've heard 2pac , Biggie and other but Em just puts words together that they wouldn't think of .. (Only my opinion, plz no hate)}
{Mettre une vidéo du grand Eminem et tomber sur une pub pour gradur, impossible de passer direct a Eminem..... je m'en remets pas}
{I love Eminem}
{Came here for big sean💯}
{I haven't listened to Eminem in a while and just watched this cause of Danny Brown and Big Sean, but I was pleasantly surprised.}
{Bunch of moaners everyone knows eminem flows different now , how many songs has he made , shut up sit back and enjoy. #eminemfan since the start.}
{The song is "Detroit vs Everybody" but are all those rapper from detroit? I know em is but the others....}
{Boys have  penis, girls have vagina}
{Not a huge Eminem fan at all, but I'm so glad ths song was made. Great way to expose Danny Brown even more. Dude is original and straight dope. Highly Recommend!}
{Y'all sleepin on big Sean's verse}
{i listen to eminem because he surrounds himself  arround black people he is the only white guy here}
{Big Sean kills the fuck outa this shit}
{Standing O for Eminem.}
{Big Sean and Eminem is the best!!}
{Eminem was great, but Big Sean was the best (:}
{slim shady is the man. not 1 rapper in that song could rap nearly as fast as Eminem}
{smashing hit from slim and the crew. there isn't 1 rapper in that song nearly as fast as Eminem}
{Can't stop listening to this song!}
{If you miss old school Eminem then you aren't an Eminem fan at all or you're just too stupid to understand his lyrics. Listen to any of his new songs, his metaphors are insane, and his word play is legendary. The amount of skill that he puts into every line is what sets him aside from everybody else, the man is a lyrical genius and he's earned that title. It makes me sick to see you guy's saying that he should go back to how he rapped before. Why? He's 10 times more skilled than he was 15 years ago and he was on drugs back then too, asking him to rap the way he used to is asking him to lower himself and go back to a way of life that he isn't particularly proud of. To make it short all of you need to shut the fuck up and enjoy the music. (As of February 1st, 2018 I would seriously suggest that you have a look at the last reply that I have just finished writing before you reply with your own angry comment on something I said 3 years ago.

{Favourite part:  "You crazy for me to flip. What's making you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson, when hes raging heated and on the way to go beat his kid. On the track I spank like he just did. DETROIT, I can never leave this bitch"}
{Why are people say Eminems part is the best. In my opinion they're all fucking legends lmao}
{EminemVEVO who is the girl}
{Br stan???? Passem no meu canal to começando agr então se inscreviam blz? Então é noiz✋}
{Yo if you think these guys are good (Which they are, they are amazing) you should listen to Hopsin. He is almost as good as most of the rappers on this track. Listen to Ill mind of hoisin 6, 5, and 4. If you think those are good download Knock Madness album as it's really good. He isn't really popular so Im just trying to promote him}
{Dam M&M you need to quit before you mess up you legacy. We Remembered the old Em' With I'LL Beats and Sick bars you are way to old to rap you suck now please Quick Hang up the gloves the fight is over}
{DETROIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!}
{Royce da 5'9 <3}
{Eminem snaped!!!}
{this is sick!they all killed it}
{LET'S GO!  #MOTORCITY  }
{Big sean tho}
{I've always wanted to be like or meet eminem. He's had a special place in my heart. And this isn't just ordinary fan boy talk. Im having the same life that eminem had as a child... Poverty, no father, not very smart, etc... I just wish I could come into contact with him somehow but to be honest, I doubt that would ever happen. I have no special attributes, some terminal disease, nothing. All I have with me is(please don't start a religion war with me) God and to keep asking Him that I one day meet the man who changed the way I feel about life. He kept me from committing suicide. Before I stop typing, I hope that one day, just maybe, I can meet the man who changed me forever, Marshal.}
{Well damn t(-.- t)}
{Big Sean had a lot of good punchlines in his verse. Eminem was just rapid spitfire like usual. He never fails to impress.}
{What is Danny brown saying}
{is it true ur gay?}
{Eminem is the only rapper I can take seriously. What I mean by that... He's the only one who's convincing, that what he says, what he does, he means. The others, I can't help but to laugh, for they seem so fake. It feels like they are just putting on a show. It doesn't feel like Eminem is just putting on a show. Now, this is not me condoning what Eminem says or does... It's just me saying, he's convincing. He has that certain power of delivering things, where you don't question if he's being phony, or lying. He'd probably make for a good actor. A good liar, as well. LOL}
{If anyone can answer this I will be surprised. I looked everywhere to see if Dej Loaf was a male or a female I can only find things that say about his or her life and shit please answer}
{What's the name of the first singer a.a}
{Types of Eminem fans: 1. STAN- Children who worship Em and think that's he's the only good rapper apart from Tupac and Biggie (who they have just heard half a song from both of them and say they are big fans of them) 2. Old School- Only fans of his old shit that just watch Em's newer stuff so that they can complain about how he's "fell off" 3. Fakes- Teenagers just trying to be cool and don't even like rap, but they only listen to Em's songs like The Monster and Not Afraid and say that they are fans of Em to gain popularity 4. True Fans- Actual fans of Em who like his old and new music, yet give other rappers and other people's opinions a chance. This is the most mature category of Eminem fans}
{When I saw that Royce and Danny brown. MY FUCKING FAVORITES. I immediately came here.}
{I turn a blunt to roach with dreams of being a beetle though}
{A lot of people are complaining about Em lately.. Of course he's not the same. Hes in his 40's now and a grown ass man. BUT one thing that is the SAME is he destroys the mic lyrically. Always has and always will. Just my opinion tho. - If anyone's just chillin out on youtube for a bit and wants to check some true meaningful hip hop, check me out and let me know what you think. Not trying to spam like everyone does tho, just sayin if your relaxing sittin back looking for something to do, check it out in my channel!﻿}

{This is awesome! Everybody kills it! Especially Big Sean and Eminem! They murdered it so bad! People say that I sound like the old school Eminem!

{I am clearly better than all of these guys.  - Rawcus }
{Eminem's verse was disappointing, all he did was rap fast, maybe there was a message in that verse he was saying, but this is my first time listening to this and I could barely understand what he was saying, I'm not exaggerating when I say it sounded like he was speaking a different language, I'm sure Eminem could rap fast and put bars on bars on bars in every song he makes, but where's that emotional feeling that you would get when listening to him rap, there was no emotion in his verse, it was like listening to a robot, but everyone changes after a period of time, everything changes at sometime}

{Em is still one of the best rappers that has ever lived. Is he perfect no, but he's still awesome. One of the first rappers I listened to and got me listening to the genre. Never turned back.}
{I'm from Detroit and I am not impressed with this shit at all. I wish they would've kept this shit a secret among themselves.}
{oh por dios es hermoso }
{Hey Stans!  You should listen to these artists  There's more rap them just Eminem Run The Jewels  A$AP Rocky  Kendrick Lamar  Schoolboy Q Joey Bada$$ Earl Sweatshirt  Freddie Gibbs  MF Doom  Big K.R.I.T.  Logic Mr. Muthafuckin Exquire}
{Danny Brown killed it. He's one of the best right now.}
{Em Killed this... not being a Stan but its just the TRUTH!.}
{Anyone else think Big Sean Sounded like old eminem in the begining?}
{eminem and these other rappers? very rare}
{Who is subscribe  to eminem}
{Hey check out this guys vids.  Danny florio. He is dope AF and needs some support}
{all of yall kid its just music ok so come down kids}
{nice}
{Okay.. fuk ya... I will shut up now}
{Lmao Danny Brown is the ugliest fucking rapper I have ever seen in my life! His verse wouldn't be so bad if I could understand what the fuck he was saying.}
{Yeah the dude.. even though this tune has me wanting to listen to it again and again to understand why it moves me.. well the dude before slim that has the kim jong un haircut.. well I think he can out speed rap you slim.. just saying.. but great tune.. great collaboration by artists that may not have had a chance had you not made it happen .... that is keeping it real and paying it forward... so.. Mr. Mathers.. you are a Hero of mine... }

{Eminems flow is terrible. I liked his flow in recovery. Now it sucks. He is at the worst he has ever been.}
{Eminem is just such a genius, lyrically. He's so talented, It doesn't matter what people think of him, he's my favorite rapper ever.}
{This shit is nasty!!!!!!!!!'}
{eminem needs to stop rapping and use his position to find new hidden talent and raise them up under shady records...}
{I love it man}
{eminem is the greatest }
{Haha Eminem smoked everyone on the song once again people are mad cause he's still the best and always will be and if you disagree you know know lyrics he lyrically destroyed this shit look at his words over and over and dissect them a little better cause that was fucking insane!!!}
{I like this song, I think big Sean had the best verse.}
{Everyone fast forward to 3:40 !!!!!!! Enjoy :) !!!!!!!!!!!!}

{People say 2pac is beast but if he was alive still he would be shit}
{Good to see Eminem and Royce both in the same song again. After that Bad Meets Evil Album/Collaboration i will always respect those 2. Absolute Fire....}
{That girl... Doesnt fit to good with the video and vocals... Coul be better.. Always skip her part}
{I am a huge fan of Eminem, but some of these Stans are out of control. Saying that he's the best, when there are other artists out there who are just as good! I'll ask some of them what their fav Em songs are and they'll say The Monster, LTWYL, Lose Yourself, etc. It really gets on my nerves when they claim that he's the best when they haven't heard his other shit lol rant sorry }

It occorred to me that I really liked raping ever since i was young. I used to rape with my friends and did it in class. my teacher didn't like It though I kept on trying. I've been practicing rape for a few years now and my goal now is to be the most famous national rapist known. please help me achieve my goal by subscribing to my channel.}

{I don't want to be mean or to diss anybody, but i think that if the girl wasn't in the song, it would be perfect, she just reminds me to much of the pop singer Lil Wayne.}
{Boss}
{Eminem will never be considered "one of the best to do it" cause the black community will never admit that a white dude can do it better}
{Fuck  He killed that shit  Yall know who im talking about  Hes style today is like another beat on top the instrumental  Got to  like it  Fuck the old em  Do u really want an  42 year old drugd out shady}

{_Ugh_Danny Brown?}
{People that call eminem a pop rapper are dumb. you must not have listened to his first two albums, even the eminem show. I would agree he has turned pop but to say he always has been pop is just ignorant.}
{non of them can rap like eminem , nobody can!!}
{Hella dope cypher}
{ohhhh}
{Danny Brown is the shit though.}
{The beat was murdered so many times you can call it Krillin}
{For everybody wondering how ppl say eminem sucked, it was his delivery! If you were an artist you would know these things, it isn't always what you say but how you say it. His vocals are all over the place, you could barely make out his words, it sounded rushed, it didn't flow together well & sounded forced over all. & its not because he rapped fast so don't let that be your rebuttal. artist like Twista & bone thugs rap fast all the time. His delivery was just horrible & forced}
{Listen to songs from my In Due Time project on my channel and give me feedback. Post a comment and like or dislike. Thank you. Peace.}

{Best song :3 I love this song}
{God damn it every fucking comment section on every eminem song is filled with controversial and philosophical comments and shit.. can't you guys just fucking relax, sit back and enjoy the song?}

{Everyone else sucked. Eminems lyrics was the only one that has rhythm nd that sounded good.}
{Man Trick Trick!}
{I actually understood 3 words of Danny Brown's verse}
{5'9's verse was best}
{Marshall is the greatest of all time so haters ?! SHUT THE HELL UP}
{Eminem's songs are nothing but complete bullshit.He only like to shout and rap at that terrible speed.Shady xv is a total waste of time.Rather I should say from infinite to shady xv he has proved how rappers can degrade.I would rather prefer IGGY for her more meaningful performances.....}
{This has to be the wackiest song hand down within the last 3 years about someone's city. Seesh yall need more rappers besides Slim Shaddy and Dej Loaf because Big Sean ass}
{Fuck Detroit!}
{Every comment is about Eminem. I'm from the suburbs of Detroit, and we don't even listen to Eminem really. We listen to Danny Brown all day though.}
{Eminem starts at 3 minutes 39 seconds}
{Did Eminem just diss Adrian Peterson? lol. It's probably because he's a Lions fan.}
{Your crazy if you think Big Sean or Em killed this... Royce went hardest, followed by Em, Sean only because he had one or two good lines although they could just be recycled and Danny did not bring shit in this song. When it got to danny's verse and the music changed I was like shit they altered the beat to suit him so this should be dope af... then danny didn't even bring it. I am a fan of all artists except Big Sean so it isn't some fan boy shit, some of you are just so blinded though. Rate an artist by the flow and lyricism, not by how good they should be or how much you wanna bang them.}
{Big Sean kind of sounds like eminem in his 20s}
{Trick Trick honestly scares me}

{Bruh if 2 Pac was alive right now and rapped with Eminem they both would be selln out albums. Cause what they got in common is the truth, not like lil Wayne he ah fucked up prick and if he didn't have any beats or audio then he wouldn't be famous. All he talks about is women and fake ass stories about runnin from the cops.😒Pathetic...}

{EMINEM verse is GENIUS!!!!!}
{if it was about race blacks wouldn't rap with him or at least try to or have one sign him so the rest is history get over it and if your black and racist remember a white guy freed  the slaves so shut up either way }
{I spit that A1 all day, I'm hittin new primes. Now the stakes higher. I just got that lmao}
{Rap has gone to shit,eminems older songs are great and some his newer ones bad guy, brainless,evil twin,legacy...etc but this is total shit.Royce 5 9 was good though.}
{Straight killer man. Great job yo}
{People treat Eminem like he is a god. Don't get me wrong he is one of the greatest in my opinion, I don't mess with his new stuff so much, still one of the greatest though, but I cant sit here and say that he is the best rapper since the beginning of hip hop, when there are a bunch of rap legends out there. You could make an argument that he is the greatest alive (Currently Rapping) when you compare him against Logic, Kendrick, J-Cole, Joey Bada$$, and Run The Jewels with Killer Mike and El-P  }
{Anyone looking straight for eminems part?}
{Nice! Everybody killed it!}

{i think Eminem should do a song with Watsky even though Watsky is less known they should group together and spit something}
{If eminem isn't the best then why is everyone talking about it I don't see anyone arguing about the other rappers being the best... He is just better deal with it and move on with life}

{Glad to see Eminem's vevo is more active}
{I like this}
{YeA}
{I personally think Eminem fell off but he was so high(weed and greatness) lol and the rap game is so low that he's still on top. I'm not saying rap sucks because there is still Kendrick, J cole and some others but their not yet on the nas jay z level yet and that's where em gets compared to. By the way I hate stans and I'm a big em fan but more of a rap fan👍}

{Stans are the reason I stopped listening to Eminem. }
{I definitely dig this. Danny Brown is one of my favorite rappers, I've loved Royce since Slim Shady LP. If it's really DETROIT vs everybody then let's see a follow up track with some more Detroit artists. Esham would be the shit. I know I'll get hate for it, but seeing a track with ICP and Em together would be great for me as a fan of both. Same goes for Twiztid. Just giving my opinion.}

{why do people keep saying eminem is the rap god or best rapper ever when what eminem does is not rap anymore he became (pop) even he admitted it and the game has an interview saying it also his music didnt hit radios em was making real rap back in the day with guys like dre jay z and many others dissing pop stars as now his singing along with them drake waye rhianna pink need i say more? eminem is not a rap god his just POP and his amazing but his amazing in a subject matter that only he has touched! so it's not like rap where u say something but it was probably already taught of his the king of a league his the only one in }

{LMFAO when black people keep bringing up 2Pac and Big whenever Eminem is being mentioned. Feeling a little bit weird with a white dude dominating black music? Tupac and BIG are the two most overrated rappers of all time.. just because they're dead. You know goddamn well Eminem would murder them on their own shit if they would still be alive and made a song together. Same way he handed Jay-Z's ass back to New York on Renegade. He would murder Nas. He would rape 2Pac. He would slaugther Big. Eminem is the best rapper out there and he didn't have to die to prove that.}

Everything that's going on in the world and the best you have to bring to the party is "hurr my town is better than your town durr". Stay classy, guys. Kids are dying so you can wear clothes, drive cars, have jewelry and smartphones: you are singing songs about how you are proud to have randomly been born into a town. You do know you didn't have a choice in where you were born right? It's like your eye colour: something that happens and you have no choice or say so in at all.}

I'll need a few watches to understand Em's lol. Royce Da 5'9'' had nice flow and I couldn't understand anything from Danny Brown. You guys like him? Lol}

Plus I'm actually a really good fan because I'm 11 and I like eminem}
{Eminem slaughtered this lyrics no doubt}
{I have two favorite rappers of all time, Eminem circa 99-04 and Eminem 08-present. They seem so different but they're both the shit. Big Sean killed it too, could be cause I'm 26 too and his verse bout listening to 50 resonated like a motherfucker}
{Simplismente foda !}
{I'm black and I grew up on eminem. I've been listening to him since i was four and I never lost interest in him. He's been someone I looked up to my whole life. Even his worst songs were songs I would still listen to and be entertained by. When he came back in 2009 and got cleaned from rehab I was proud of him.  He made me realize that anyone can make it, if they put hard work and dedication to it. Just listening inspired me to be a rapper.  Other rappers inspired me too such as 50 cent and ludacris. So color is irrelevant to me in the rap game. As long as the artists put out exceptional music I'm fine with who they are.}
{the beat isn't that great. should've had key wane produce it!}
{How is Big Sean popular?}
{Yo I love eminem but I feel to many people just on his dick without even knowing his music and comprehending why it is so great. They just hear a bunch of fast rhyming but I hear puny references, metaphor, alliteration, oxymorons, and multiple of other literature devices that many rappers don't put into their raps. This is why in my opinion he is the greatest. He can do all that and even speak his story while doing it like pax and biggie. But at the same time I wasn't around to experience them when they were great. Like Wu tang is Fuvkin great but I never got the full affect of being around them when they were great. I know I can listen to their old music but I feel like being alive when they were out and about matters as well. There are a lot of eminem fans because he is great but to many of them just jump the bandwagon because he is the realest to this day and never experienced other great rappers.}

{I wonder if any of them went to the auto show}
{EM RAPS SO FAST IN THIS ONE AND IN RAP GOD}

{Shady is THE shit. DETROIT!}
{New trend "New eminem is bad , because is white"  Fuck you guys! is still the best, you don't have ears if you don't hear Em's flow here , is the best. This is how you put some lyrics on a song, Why? Because he won't rap anymore about his past bad life?  He did it already, how many songs do you think he can make about his past life? WTF!. And btw kids, The song is good, Eminem part is just sick , is like the song is made just for him , his flow and the song is perfect! HATE ON HATERS}

Eminem still over towers everyone....}
{Eminen is not the greatest of all time. not even Pac or Biggie or Nas or Jigga or Rakim or Big Daddy Kane etc. you know why? because there is no greatest of all time, it is just a bunch of great rappers with different skill sets so lets just enjoy what each has got to offer. beyond that, its just subjective. my favourites are Nas, Jigga, Eminem and Biggie}

{Anybody complaining about his "flow" or whatever the fuck. Maybe its just too complex for a regular earthling to comprehend or understand. Hes too genius for normal brained humans anyways. Makes sense to him in his hi tech brain. Sick as F.}
{Missin Black Milk ;(}
{How could people say Eminem ruined the song? If you think he ruined this song, you must not like paying attention to lyrics, cause the way Shady spits, he like forces you to listen. There's no way you can understand Eminem if your just in a car listening to it or playing it with your friends. Eminem connects to each of us individually, so you gotta listen to him individually. But he features in this song so whatever, just fucking listen and stop bitchin, he did what he does on this track, what he's always done.}
{im allitle ashamed of eminem... I mean. He would never rap with big sean when he was slim}
{Everybody did their thing on this. So nice to hear good hip-hop. Like a breath of fresh air.}
{IMO its silly to list who had the best verses, they've all good rappers because of their individual versatility, the fact em was on the track clearly made them up their game. Its a new track and the fact Danny brown is in it is clearly shocking people, give it a week and you'll be fully aware of the wordplay and how good of a song this actually is.}

{I liked every1's verse except for Danny Brown (hate his voice).  I actually really liked Big Sean's verse, thought it was pretty good, idk if he repeated some things because I don't listen to him that much.  I love Royce and think him and Crooked are the best in SH with Royce being #1.    Em's verse was the usual.  I had to rewind some parts to actually understand some of what he was saying as usual, but it was pretty good.  Em is one of the few rappers that TRULY doesn't give a flying fuck..}

{Eminem is the New York Yankees of Hip Hop. He has his ups and downs, but back in the day his ups were monumentous. He is undisputedly one of the best. He is adored by his fans but by anyone who has a different favorite rapper, he's hated on. }

{Shady Lately it seems as if it's me against the world Like it was before my life became a movie And they usually use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with But I flip that script like AB filler Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script I ain't bein' conceited But I made it to radio, eat a dick I still never ABC the shit Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla I was daydreamin' one day that I would be the shit And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage You crazy for me to flip What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid On the track I spank like he just did (DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch Sick of bein' treated like me and shit Jesus, I can see why people stop callin' me to do features And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me, I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch 180 degrees in here Trying to wait for the cedar chips MCs bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish On a reign with a two penises Hateful and genius, this inconvenience And for the record, you won't want this kind of static in your life When I'm makin' you cling to it They consider tryna reinsulate yah when it's maybe in for another crazy winter Cause it's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde Sick of bein' underdog Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with your relation, changin' it It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety center Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated that could be danger Did you make arrangements with the gangsters when you came here? And I came to kill 'em}
{Danny Brown Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River And to think y'all hood harder then I might beg to differ Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller In a blink I'll hit your kisser, have your ass not rememberin' They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman Had K's in front ya school, but I ain't going to Kettering Cough up a lung, 313 where I'm from Xan got me cross eyed like Bernstein’s son Any niggas try to copy, put a hole in his top It's us vs. them, Detroit vs Everybody}

{Big Sean Boy I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety 100 percent cut, no stitches required Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your ass firin' I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin' Boy I hit the beat I just treat that shit like a diary I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dawg in the vet Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch Got the ball in my hand and the ball in the net Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me I'm overrespected, my mama's gated community's overprotected So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 50 times a day Back when 10th grade was like 50 days away Tryna get paid 50 ways a day Used to put 50 on the layaway, now my closet 50 shades of grey 26 and I've done lived a lifetime a few times From futons to Grey Poupons In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines Or takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?" Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years I know it took way longer than 9 months, but fuck it, it's all in due time I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though Don' want to "I need to", you gotta learn to keep it cerebral When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful This is just part 1, wait 'til the sequel}

{Typical comments coming from a Stan on an Eminem video: 1. Only came here for Eminem 2. Like if you skipped to Eminem's part 3. If you don't think Eminem is the best rapper ever you are a hater because you have no right to have an opinion of your own. 4. Top 5 rappers:     1.Eminem     2.Marshall Mathers     3.Slim Shady     4.B-Rabbit from 8 mile     5.The white guy in d12 I swear Eminem has the most annoying fans ever. There is a whole different world out there in hip hop rather than only listening to Eminem. You guys need to open your ears to other artists.. I promise you won't regret it.}

{eminem changed the way of singing, because the nerve that began from psychological knot because his father left him, which had become depressed and nervous, which was caused by psychological node, and now gone nerve, this explains that eminem way to sing different, because the way he sings was  taking out the emotions and nervousness that made his songs different unlike the rest of music rappers and this made eminem legend,and now when his rage is gone he singing traditional way as the rest of rappers}
{Here come the Dickriders ! I mean COME ON!!!!! SHADY XV was trash Just that eminem used to be a good rapper doesnt mean he's gonna keep the crown forever tbh he's just another shitty rapper who has'nt dropped a good album for ten years! listen to real shit! danny's fire tho}

{ Eminem is good. But Brazil has the best rappers. Harmful Shomon is better than Tupac and Eminem together. Here's a diss to Eminem and Tupac:Tupac fuck, fuck eminem. I'm not here to say what the crowd wants to hear I came to make Empire of the bag fall And see the mouse run away and abandon ship Tired of crowded party to hear rap empty My challenge is not competition MC You fight every day to see my daughter smile At the headquarters of demolishing such repeated rhyme You account a lot of history for those who have so little life Always the same idea that only you suffered I struggled quite the rap for you say he is your There fucked, clone the the microphone is fucking On stage sends the kid lie pyre and becomes fashion Some sing for love others just to make name Treta is put kid to do man's role Inevitable wage war in this land of atheists To silence false prophet who thinks that God turned do not sleep in the noise of shit I also know Boy you is not the hill and will never turn King Be careful what you write, it should be more cautious Shouts that is the street will never be the favela Harmful hammers runs over the Ramela by which the scene Your cache is heavy but your rap is featherweight}
{eminem i love u too much u are the one who changed my life , i listen to eminem songs when i was 14 , his song full of rage and emotion , eminem singing from his heart about his sad life with full of rage and emotion  , the first song of eminem i heared is when im gone and now i have all his albumes from 1994 to this albume , and now im 19 years old , and fuck u all the haters u are just bitches hate eminem bcus the other stupid ass black rappers cant be like him  }
{The first couple of verses put me off}
{It was a good record,  but I guarantee you if my New York rappers put they ego aside and decided to get lyrically busy,  they would body this track,  and I'm gonna give you my list,  and it maybe more than 4 rappers that will body Detroit.  My fantasy rapper team: Kool G Rap Jay-Z Nas Method Man Loaded Lux Remy Ma Rakim Joell Ortiz Jadakiss Fab KRS 1 Nicki Minaj Lloyd Banks Uncle Murda Papoose Busta Rhymes Murda Mook DMX They might have to make four records because it's too much skills for one beat.  Just be glad that your boy Eminem really stays in the lab and thinks.  I'll give him major props for that.  Too many NY rappers be chilling,  and I hate that.  Overall this Detroit record was dope. I was really impress with Big Sean.  Royce is overrated.  The dude with that wild hair seems like the ODB of Detroit.  Em did good.  He raps so fast that I gotta go back and analyze,  but I'm not a true fan to do that,  and the outro was the best with Trick Trick.  Even though he talked.  THE BEAT WAS HARD! ﻿}
{If you skipped the video till Em's part, you just missed some good rappers. }

{   I don't really  understand how people can possibly say eminem's only successful cuz he's white or say that he's overrated. He's the greatest rapper of all time and you are just hating if you say otherwise. He's better than both biggie and pac. Eminem's always inspired me, he's a huge inspiration. I'm a 16 year old rapper that earned 2,000 subscribers in less than a year. Check a couple of my songs out and tell me what you guys think!}

{Awesome.}
{блять такая отстойная песня}
{thats why we came here 3:39}
{i see so many comparisons to pac nd biggie nd how they're still the best lol. ok pac nd big rapped about stuff that was only relevant to the black cultural struggle. em transcends all of that nd speaks on stuff that everyone can relate to. take a long hard look in the mirror cuz if u wanna lie to yourself nd say he's not the best u more than likely don't like white ppl... let's be honest, big n pac were def genius but they're just not on this level of thinking! have a good one :)}

{I personally love Eminem's part. I don't get why there's so much hate on him. And stop saying he is the best rapper alive,because he isn't. There are many great rappers out there(some maybe even not famous). And Eminem is one of those best rappers. Also if you miss the old Eminem,just go and listen to his old songs,instead of whining on his new songs,which are good(of course that's just my opinion).}

{So futuristic I'm already over my next bitch}
{Eminem has some balls putting Adrian Peterson on blast.  I'm pretty sure there are more than a handful of occasions where he was absolutely just lit around hailey, but you know that's not child abuse.  He didn't put her life in danger or anything so he's fine with throwing stones at a man who punished his child in a manner considered negligent because being drunk and high off pills around your daughter and making skits about it in your songs are fine.  Think about it.  What if you died from an overdose and your daughter hailey came in and decided to ingest the same poison you took.  Your lucky that never happened and you should be thankful with every breath you take as a sober man that it didn't.  BTW Adrian Peterson was charged by a court of law and punished according to those state laws.  You on the other hand have never been charged for being intoxicated or under the influence of a controlled substance while your daughter was in your custody or had TMZ photos exposing that very same negligent and dangerous parenting even though we all know it happened.  I'm sure that's something even you wouldn't protest.   Instead you have used your daughter hailey as a source of income legally punishment free.  So what if you were a drug taking pill popping alcohol binging father.  You never got caught or had photos dropped so your innocent because we don't have proof to it.  Besides the song wrote for hailey made up for all that, you know the old 2 birds one stone.  Apologize and exploit my child to further my income and hopefully make up for being bad father move.  Men who live in glass houses shouldn't throw bricks.}

{Still the king n will always be.}
{Eminem is alright,but he simply cannot ever be the "greatest". Biggie and Pac spoke on realness throughout their entire legacy, while Em was known for spazzing out over his mom n stuff. Did Em have some real hip hop joins, yea but it was about him vs the government. He never really reached the community the way Pac and Biggie did..heck even KRS. There are numerous hip hop artist both main and unsigned that are way better for hip hop than he was and is today. Just my opinion. }
{Detroit, NY would eat you and spit you out...after all...they started the game that you're still learning about...juss sayin....}
{Look at these new age Eminem dicksuckers. 80% whiteboys who are impressed with his random babbles "mom's spaghetti", and the fact that he rhymes on a quicker pace makes em go "oh shit, he did it again". Hes good but THE ONLY REASON he is as popular is because he is white. (he says this himself in "White Amerikka") There are plenty of black underrated rappers that are better. And quality ain't based on how quick you spit or how crafty you fit that shit.. it's gotta have meaning too. you can fit a shitload words, but they don't necessarily have meaning. a shitload of Em's tracks, especially in the beginning of his career were purely for entertainment "They call me superman, i'm here to rescue you.." Get the f*ck outta here with crowning him rap god and shit.. Pac was rappin about single mom's struggles, societal issues, justice and injustice.. while this nigga was making meaningless "Slim shady" songs, probably still sleeping in that Alf shirt with that f*cking mullet...}
{danny brown killed it but em still was best}
{"SHADY'S been a lady KILLER since the day I went insane and attacked the babysitter with a potato peeler, and mushed her face into the entertainment center..." CLASSIC from the ALL MIGHTY!! A lot of syllables in this video.}
{If they cropped of Danny Royce and trick, song would've been 10/10 but as it is its 8/10}
{From the beginning to the end, What is the order of rappers?}
{I like Em. I've been a fan of his back when he was super underrated by fans, some of the same fans who were claiming that Wayne was the best rapper alive before moving over to hop on Em's dick but anyway I really dislike this busta-esque flow he's been using since Rap God released, I honestly prefer his classic shady flow or more specifically his flow from songs like Renegade, Patiently Waiting, even Forever}
{This was amazing!!! But imo danny brown ruined this song, his loud annoying voice just made it funny and was hard to understand him. }
{Can you explain me ? Who is detroid ,}
{eminem is the shit. race aside, if a black dude flowed like him he'd be nearly as successful.}

{Like If Your Watching In 2015:D}
{I know i aint the only one that skips past the guys part before eminem who sounds like a constipated squirrel}
{dope}
{EMINEM DAME HIJOS}
{I LOVE EMINEM <3}
{Em is Puttin his city on like everybody is suppose too!!}
{I miss his old shit}
{4:02}
{am i the  only one that peeped trick trick say cuz then throw up BLOOD...but thats none my business }
{When will I ever learn an eminem verse smh but great track loved Big Sean verse}
{Royce still has it}
{This song defeated by fifty shade of grey this world is real cray}
{Never thought I would have ever said that Big Sean murdered this song crazy verse...now let's see wat happens when it's New York vs Everybody....}
{eminem HAS proved that he is d best n he is D RAP GOD ...noBODY can do wat he can do man..!! n this song ! nothin 2 say buddy !! keep fuckin Rap god like that !!}
{Big Sean was going in. He really proved me wrong. I wasn't the biggest fan of his. Respect tho!}
{eminem is plain and simple, a lyrical genius, in literally every sense of the word... hes crazy, he can rap about anything, in any context, and hes been doing it all of his life not just for a few years}
{Nice song this sht is a good song already and he barely made this song lol}
{Dej loaf 💕}
{"A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free"........ whoa.  }
{this is sick!!!! im up & coming, check me out when you get a chance}
{The third person who raps looks like day on crack}
{#Eminem#Amazingly Skilled}
{Anybody who says Big Sean's verse was the best...what? Did you listen to him? He sounds monotone the entire time, like he has no spark or energy. He sounded like he was just trudging through the verse, and that he really didn't feel like doing it. In fact, half way through his verse I thought it felt too long. People these days only listen to rappers for punchlines. That's the only reason people listen to anybody from Young Money. Go listen to some Run the Jewels and get on that grown man hip-hop.}
{Кому нужны скороговорки, когда есть песни Эминема?}
{Danny Brown sounds as goofy as he looks.}
{Em is amazing, the way he entered in this "black game" ( i think u understand me, not being racist ) is just amazing, no other white rapper can come close to him. I mean, i cant even think of one.}
{I would like to see someone make a lyrics video for this song 😂}
{Eminem ripped this shit up damn aha}
{Don't be throwing up illuminati hand signs at me trick! power of Christ compels you! }
{F u c k in Awesome Yo}
{this is one of Eminems best verses ever i think.}
{"26 and I done lived a life time a few times"}
{G.O.A.T...}
{i think a video for this song was unnecessary. he should do a video for psychopath killer}
{Detroit vs Everybody stfu just shut up you vs nobody you just got an additude go cool of and make a new song stupid }
{Nice I like it!}
{Big Sean definitely did his thing! Loved the chorus by Dej Loaf also!}
{There just jealous of Eminem ......... But I don't blame them he is good}
{I need a T-Shirt that says "Batman V.S. Everybody"}
{Man...a million "Detroit" posse videos in black and white with Eminem. One line about jay dee all over some "good" not "great" "good" beats. I'm not from the D, but c'mahn. C'maaaaaaaaahn, more Dilla in the Detroit videos}
{this song is like an oreo, I only like the white part.}
{Detroit Vs. Everybody#Official #Video}
{Who ever hates Eminem they SUCK!!!!!!!!!!}
{oh shit ! Eminem aint getting old for sure. He fucking killed it !}
{Save the best for last}
{Good video for eminem}
{Everyone knows that if Chicago rappers made a song together it would be better.}
{Just listen to eminem's part carefully and you will notice how deep the lyrics are}
{Who's 2nd verse?}
{Just watched 8 Mile again & got reminded how f***in brilliant Eminem is!! }
{Whoever thinks Shady isn't holding it down; you're DUMB AS FUCK. He's changed HIS game and other people's game in the process, and STILL stays around. All these fake ass rappers we haven't heard of? WE HAVEN'T HEARD OF THEM FOR A REASON.}
{Are Danny Brown and Big Sean wearing the same glasses?}
{Bring D12 back baabbbyy}
{Danny Brown is just terrible. This song has a serious and cool tone and then Danny comes in and just like he had a seizure and spits random things into the mic its hilarious}
{Dej loaf 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😩}
{"Eminem is the best rapper of all time!" -Said Every White Person Ever *grabs popcorn*}
{The flow was hot in this order:Big Sean, Eminem, (I like Eminem better, I just thought Big Sean really brought it this time) Royce Da 5'9 and then that crazy guy who I would literally pay someone a million dollars if they could recite what he said without googling it. (I know who Danny Brown is, but wtf was that...)}
{Who's the white guy at 3:40? He has potential.}
{Nice}
{That black girls voice is fucking awful.}
{Sup}
{I am sorry}
{Meh, this was lame, Em's verse was the only decent one here....}
{On point y'all, but fuck the Red Wings. }
{@ayushpandya big Sean and Eminem.}
{@LaliLicious what about smallie?}
{I'll take Em's Infinite album over the bullshit any day of the week. Since when did Eminem become the Micro Machines dude? Slow down. You're irrelevant.}
{@DannyCarranza ikr}
{Matty b is the only good white rapper he is the rap god}
{@PickedFirst4Kickball so you like the third rapper I assume. He fits your intelligence.}
{@EduardoJuarez he ruins the song}
{odel young  best white/puerto rican artist out}
{At 3:02 reminds me of that one key and peele episode holy shit.}
{@КириллАрхипов you'll have those cities}
{Danny brown is a joke.}
{Eminem still got his flow since 2009}
{I just came her because of royce the 5'9....and because he was in gta3 LeL. Oh yeah and fuck eminem :3}
{rugby pitch at 2:17}
{Am I do only person who likes Danny Brown's verse?}
{Being from the Detroit area this song got me hype shoutout to Em for setting this up! Detroit Vs Everybody!}
{This is the best music collab of all time🙌}
{Em isn't the greatest rapper he's very lryical but look at 2 PAC, biggie small, big pun, big l, but Eminem is at the top with them}
{Em is BACK on some hard shit!!!}
{If youre not a fan dont comment because it bothers them badly}
{All i ask is for yall to at least respect eminem}
{This sucked, Eminem is the only redeemable part to this video. Leave you're Crying comments below.}
{ I don't really  understand how people can possibly say eminem's only successful cuz he's white or say that he's overrated. He's the greatest rapper of all time and you are just hating if you say otherwise. He's better than both biggie and pac. Eminem's always inspired me, he's a huge inspiration. I'm a 16 year old rapper that earned 2,000 subscribers in less than a year. Check a couple of my songs out and tell me what you guys think!﻿}
{Realistically to understand eminen, you'd have to slow down the track lol}
{everyone says their favourite wrapper is eminems but i personally like the skittles wrapper}
{To tell the truth i live in chiraq but i will never go to Detroit that shit look like killers every were}
{My nigga b I g went in}
{Detroit vs. This dick}
{I listen to Eminem he's my favorite hip hop artist}
{Everyone go sub to me cuz i want money. Make my ass rich}
{Love this song}
{beast, but the girl singing the chorus sucks}
{All the eminem cock riders he is not the best to let you know chiraq is where the real rappers come from}
{OH MY GOD YES}
{In my opinion this is my favorite video of em's .... Who is with me lol}
{Like if you skipped passed Em because he sucks ass.}
{Danny Brown kills it}
{Yes omg}
{This is what happens when bad meets evil. }
{Lets be honest everyone there killed it}
{The amount of "black" and "white" I'm seeing in the comments are sad. Why are we looking at these artists by the color of their skin. Em is one of the best because he's one of the best, point blank. Can we at least keep discrimination away from hip-hop?}
{}
{Is it just me or is Danny Brown's voice really annoying?}
{3:40 You're welcome.}
{Logic is better than all of these rappers together!!}
{Eminem you are the Best human, you should be proud of you man}
{very niceeeeeeeeeeeeee}
{"So futuristic I'm already over my next bitch" Damn!}
{....}
{You Em fans(mostly dick riders) think multis are everything, but bar for bar Big Sean had the best verse.}
{I'm still pissed at this song, no Black Milk, Elzhi, or Jon Connor so it's not really Detroit vs Everybody﻿}
{i think big sean is too main stream for my taste but he fucking killed this shit. props.}
{I loved big Sean and Eminem's part! 👏}
{}
{RIP PROOF!}
{He sound like the kid who said 21 at the beginning of the song}
{eminem you're cool}
{I haven't been feeling Em lately like he's forcing it too much, but I think everyone else did good.  }
{Ohh Eminem goods }
{Eminem the best!}
{Sad to say but big sean had the best part and dj loaf omg get the shet out of here}
{It's a good thing big Sean's got Ariana grande going for him cuz he sucks ass at rapping it was uncomfortable and awkward watching him rap:P}
{União que o mubdo conheça Detroit e seu Rap parabens a todos}
{Wow.  Some amazing rhymes here.}
{Danny browns was by far the best verse in my opinion flow, lyric, and meaning all there.}
{Dont understand a word eminem says these days. May as well be rapping in Japanese sorry.}
{Eminem <3}
{That girl singing is extra fucking annoying.  Her voice is terrible.  Eminem's part was hot. His flow is nice}
{Eminem Vs. Everybody}
{it shoulda been eminem, big sean, and dej loaf}
{The 3 people that's was good was Royce,Big Sean,and Eminem}
{This video was mediocre at best. Come on, it should've been Eminem and Royce. Big Sean, Danny and Dej are crap when it comes to topics such as these.}
{EMINEM is my idol}
{eminem...the name is enough!!}
{о чем они читают то? нефига непонятно =)}
{Poor rap, it seems this music and its culture has seen it's hay day, much like rock n roll and dare i say ig dubstep. To me, there's nothing new and exciting for this genre to exploit. It all just seems as predictable as a chuck berry solo}
{I wish there were no comments on YouTube. Every burger flipper on earth thinks they're the Oracle of Hiphop. Go listen to what you like and shut the fuck up. Or at least write your hater comments on soft paper, so at least I can wipe my ass with them.  Great video. Has a hook. Showcases some Detroit talent. Introduces people to some artists they may not have heard before. Would have been nice to have Esham on this.}
{Who else is from DETROIT??}
{Eminem killed it. Big Sean killed it. Danny Brown killed it.  All I see In the comments. -.- stfu  And enjoy the good song.  EVERY ONE Killed it.}
{Eminem. Eminem, Eminem. As usual, kills it. Murders it, destroys it, obliterates and eviscerates, torn up, shreds it and burns it, pisses on it. }
{Thats a good song love at the end that thay got some one to where a jupper with prof on it love it}
{I'd say royce and danny were the dopest. I don't like eminem's flow here, and like alot say his lyrics are to predictable, I think he's overrated because of what he did in hip hop in the past. I never really liked big Sean so I don't feel like judging him}
{Dope}
{Em is all about that wordplay now.. i mean holy shit!}
{Detroit came together & killed it needs to be more unity needs to come together in hip hop this year this is a good way to start it off. Eminem killed it but idk why I would be expecting less!}
{Now do a video for the Official Remix :D}

{This is the eminem i miss}
{its a song. leave the racism where it belongs, in the 50's. you basic fucks}
{Christ, that guy at 2:57 looks like the old man from Back to the Future and I can't understand him.}
{everyones here for eminem and im just here cuz im from detroit n i wanted to see what it was about...}
{FINALLY, Eminem shows his lyrical skills again. I've been tired of his crap pop music. Before this, everything after his Relapse album was meh. Glad to see this legend go at the mic like he used to. }
{Whait it dis I don pic e.g.}
{Eminem message me asap plz atho I no u wont}
{Thumbs up if you skip it to the eminent verse}
{To all the people who think why BIG SEAN is singing in this video- he was born in Santa Monica, California but moved to Detroit when he was only 3 months old, where he was raised by his mother and grandmother. He attended Detroit Waldorf School and graduated from Cass Technical High School with a 3.7 GPA.}
{Eminem is the best rapper tho}
{Imagine if they did LA vs everybody.... RIP rap game 😂😂😂 FOH Detroit 🚮🚮🚮}
{Fucking over 14 million subscribers, and yet this video only has 1.6million views? SMH, this youtube sub system is just fucking plain sad. Shoulda hit 10 million views the first day.}
{HEY MAN GO 3:39 =)}
{I know you probs came here for Eminem but DAMN BIG SEAN HOMIE....... RUMBLE YOUNG MAN RUMBLE!}
{Fuck American Coney Island, Lafayette is were its at!!!}
{what the fck is big sean doing there i hate him soooo much (only reason why i hate him is cause he is dating ariana grande)}
{Намешали блин...}
{This is dope}
{Love the song but there are some eminem videos that are top produced and this one is so poorly recorded. Even the lip sync is weird. }
{Lo amoooo. 😍😍😍}
{Did anyone hear the part about Adrian Peterson?}
{Real hip_hop}
{Detroit aint got shit on CHIiraq!!! Humblodt Park crazy!!}
{Na moral, só vale apena assistir a parte de Eminem 03:39}
{Is the guy around 3:10 even a real rapper?}
{Eminem i  love you! peace}
{This was kind of weak.}
{lol saved eminem for last, saved the best for last}
{So what I understood was this: - Detroit is shit - people are poor and suffer - blacks shooting at everyone - no pity for the poor - take pity on Eminem because he hasn't left Detroit yet}
{3:39 for Eminem's verse.}
{Eminem is amazing}
{How does danny brown kill it but lil s got more time and sucked shit out of a asshole on that track!! I-94 robbery}
{primer comentario mexicano}

{Eminem The best ever }
{Oh my gad i need dancy now bilive me.......}
{So good}
{fuck bois, x-spet eminem, he killed it. still the whole song was just awkward, and i aint hating just because im from cleveland.}
{ I hate rap, but I like Eminem. I guess I just hate the rap that isn't Pure. He always come out with the better songs.}
{Okay, here's one thing that pisses me off, Everyone that raps in this song is actually born in Detroit except for Big Sean, they should of kept it to rappers that were actually born in Detroit to make it actually more realistic/accurate}
{Murder. SHADYXV out now via iTunes!}
{dis iz colder than Detroit}
{Em" s verse is sick but big sean fucking killed it, and I'm white just sayin!  Trick reminded me of proposition Joe from the wire and 5"9 you hard but it's just like you don't have what it takes to be in the presence of this caliber of artists.}
{Still not a big Em fan, but he did great. Big Sean usually sucks, but did alright. BIG Danny Brown fan, and he didn't as well as he could've.... Hey, at least its not another fucking song about how great L.A. is, right??}
{men , eminem his the best in the best on the best fuck he kill it loooooveeee u ur the hestori of the rap ur like the golden book that any rapers wont to know what the real rap they have 2 read u cause ur the golden book}
{Is it just me or does dej loaf say "everybody" really weird, i can't get over it}
{lol em rapping to fast for the beat xD}
{There is Nothing more annoying than people who dumb down big sean like hes not lyrical. Hes lyrically capable to put out dope ass music. He had a dope verse on this but you have to realize hes on here with royce Em And danny brown.. Theyre in their own league. but dont say big sean is trash hes put out lyrical music. Listen to his freestyles, old mixtapes especially detroit. His lyrics are there but you here IDFWU on the radio and say hes a garbage rapper off one song you dont like. Im a hip hop fan from biggie, pac, Pun, nas, andre 3000, etc. all im saying is be open and actually listen to other material not just what you listen to on the radio. His old mixtapes and freestyles will definately make you change your point of view on sean's lyrical abilities.}
{Absolutely love this video and song.  }
{EminemVEVO <3}
{Finally a video love it always loving eminem whether it's new shit or old shit always stay by ur side}
{Dislikes?? Nobody likes real bars anymore?}
{My mom hates eminem}
{Lol Big Sean look like Tyron Biggums}
{EMINEM killed it and made the best part of the song, as he usually and always does in every fucking song he is in}
{thanks again EM for this beautiful song,im telling you people he is a legend,best of all the time.EM is not the best but no one is better than him is incomparable.}

{No, back to the real shady please.}
{Straight up. Big sean had the best verse.  1. Sean 2. Royce 3. Em 4. Danny  In all honesty I like Danny's part better than Em I only gave Em the higher spot just cuz it's his song. They all did great nonetheless. Hook was really dope by Dej}
{Idc what yall say big Sean killed that shit he is a dawg bruh}
{Terrible, I could not finish this video. }
{Decent dog but that's the worst chorus I've ever heard}

{Its absolutely foolish to say Eminem is bad.  People don't fully understand the ceiling of talent that he had to reach, and the amount of overall work that needed to be done, to get to the level that he is at now from the time that he was coming up from nothing.  A lot of these guys who are big now wouldn't of had made it in his young days.  As soon as hip hop became mainstream and pop, it became more about promotion and less about talent.  Its now more about having an attractive image that will bring in money for publishers, record labels, and corporations/services that need advertising and hire artists.  Plus, its all social networking now.  It isn't about the music, its about sales.  People will eat up what is thrown in front of them because it is convenient.  Kids don't need to search for culture when "culture" is fed to them everywhere they look.  Eminem is a musical legend and always performs better than the majority of other rappers.  I actually thought Big Sean did better than usual in this song...a little bit of passion and personal substance to move with his "punchline" attraction that everyone seems to be drawn to when it comes to his persona.  Regardless, kids don't realize that the golden age of hip hop has very much come and gone.  That's not even up for discussion coming from both a cultural and musical prospective.  Another thing for kids to note is that production potential has seen major improvements in the passed 15 years.  Any one can be a producer if they have the will, a little cash, and a computer.  In the early nineties, when Em was coming up aside other big names like Jay-Z, Nas, and Busta Rhymes (to name a few), a rapper normally had to pay for a studio or get enough attention rapping and battling in public places to have them invite you in to use the tools necessary to produce a track.  These days someone bad can cost efficiently make something terrible sound perfect, while sitting comfortably on their living room couch. That's an extreme, but I think it establishes my point.  Its no coincidence that Eminem and those other rappers listed are still relevant in their forties.  Yeah they have the money to keep putting out music, but Eminem sells more albums than any other rapper in this world because of his skill.  His character is unique.  His history is crazy.  He's been through a wild house of mirrors in his career.  Yet, at the end of the day, its really just skill. The success is no surprise.  I don't like all of his verses but none of them are "bad".  The skill is certainly there. I'd rather have an artist approach skill before content.  Its the other way around with most rappers and pop artists today.  Anyway, solid video lol.}

{OKAY ENOUGH! Yes Eminem is an amazing precise rapper but im tired of all the dick-riders not fans DICK-RIDERS.Saying skipped to Ems part I honestly bet you don't even know who the other people in the song are except for Big sean. And im also tired seeing the ignorant comments like "This song is like an oreo" or "a mountain" Eminem even said himself if his skin color did affect his success in 2 songs and an interview but you guys don't even pay attention the words the dick riders of this song are 7-15yr olds and white girls.}

{ to be honest the only issue people really have is they dont want to deal with the cold hard truth that em is there primarily because white america. Whites want to live in this illusion em is there because every place and every culture that likes hip hop embraced him heavy when thats not true. The macklemoore guy is better than em because unlike him he came out and Honestly said much of his success is due to being white and white privilege. He did the right thing because that takes the pressure off him and puts it on em and igster. its just the truth man.﻿}

{Amazing how the video shows both the high and low points of the D. There is so much more to Detroit than people tend to look for. Instead, they’re focusing on what they’ve heard through media and news outlets. Give yourself time and an open mind, and you’ll love Detroit. America’s Great Comeback City.}

{Так незаметно и как-то нечаянно заканчивается в этом мире все И внезапно замечаю я, что тебя почему-то нет рядом И как это ни парадоксально, мир живет и движется, и мне тоже куда-то надо И какие-то люди другие рядом, чужая компания А у меня внутри холодная тоска и неисполненные желания Конечно, я помню все твои родинки, и твое тепло греет меня еще вроде бы А я все еще ношу с собой нашу фотографию И хочется сильно прижаться к тебе и почувствовать и обнять Ведь ты часть моей маленькой биографии Но тебя нет со мной рядом. Но я хочу трогать тебя И краснеть и стесняться под твоим взглядом И все врут, что вселенная не терпит пустотности. Ложь! Вранье! Есть кто-то, кто придумал эти дурацкие условности А я отменяю все законы физики и небо над головой Хочу знать, что ты есть где-то и ловить губами голос твой А небу не прикажешь, и с этим не спорю я И на руке у каждого прописана его история Но выбор все-таки мы делаем сами Жить, страдать, любить или просто уйти туда вслед за облаками И встречать и провожать тех, кого любишь И помнить их глаза Надеяться, что там им будет лучше И каждый день просыпаться с этим А со временем возможно даже обрести покой Но я хочу знать, что ты есть где-то и ловить губами голос твой}

Just listen to the music you like, when I feel like a relaxed flow and beat I often listen to Nas/Pac/Biggie because they're good at that, but when I want some killer wordplay and rude lyrics I'd rather listen to Em (mostly oldschool) and slaughterhouse.  And stop complaining about Em, sure he is less of a killer than he used to be but the guy is still great for Hip-Hop. The guy brought some excellent rappers in the game.}

I love eminem hes the greatest hands down, he's always there when i'm down, i wonder if they're gonna shoot another video for this album?}

{Only problems with this video: 1. Too many quick cuts, got a bit annoying 2. Danny Brown looks like a joke and made this video funny 3. Trick Tricks part at the end was so out of place it was unreal. I laughed a bit. Just get rid of those 2 parts and you have a good video}
{detroit vs. everybody? more like danny brown vs. everybody lol.}
{This girl can't even lip sync lol}
{Еменем рулит:)америка rap это ваша стихия так держать!!!}
{Lol   . Where do I begin. OK this stupid shit is only heard by crack heads in that shit hole city of Detroit . The only thing Detroit could be good for is to shoot an episode of the walking dead.  These cunts sound like shit . The high pitched voice girl is fucking annoying and has zero talent . The crack head with the glasses is eben worse . And the white fuck up that sounds like a 10 year old on meth is unbearable . Over all I see no way these cunts will ever make it in life .  Get a job hobos}
{detroit cant even look good in music videos }
{Detroit Merkez Ayık Olsun Herkes :)}

{хуйня}
{OMG em & Sean 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥}
{Люблю и уважаю Эма}
{How nice of the makers to let a local crackhead rap in the middle of this. It's not everyday you see an overweight one, good find. I don't listen to rap, because they slur and are unclear in their vocabulary. The black guy who sounds like eminem was good, but what happened to em? He sounds only half better than the crackhead.}
{Look up, jak08y!}
{I'm a huge Em fan, but idc Big Sean MURDERED his verse, he went the hardest hands down}

{EMINEM! <3 }
{1. Danny Brown (SHIIIT! Danny Brown is so dope) 2. Royce Da 5'9 (Killed it, his flow and lyricism were fantastic) 3. Eminem (Pretty lackluster, not bad but I can't stand that flow.... 4. Big Sean (He didn't have a terrible verse though, it was decent....)}
{Big Sean killed it by far. Yall trippin' mane}
{Why was trick trick on this? To intimidate any battle rappers that showed up for the video shoot. Royce Da 5'9" should've blown up with Em.}
{its fkin awesome man! hands down!}

{I live in Detroit!}
{thumbs up if you are here for BIG sean}
{I've seen an interview in 1999 where he despised himself for thinking the faster you rapped the better you were, now it's just ironic.}
{Big Sean killed shit, Best verse Big Sean.. B.I.G Sean Don.. Eminem 2 best verse}

{so is this thing an official song or music video ?!}
{New York has Empire State of Mind  Detroit has Detroit Vs. Everybody Waitin' for LA.}
{I know what I'm about to say has nothing to do with the video, but there's a few very annoying people that need to be addressed. Every time I go on an eminem video I see this ' Eminem nowadays isn't as good, he needs his old style ' He's 40 fucking years old moron! Holy fucking shit XD Okay, now I have that out of my system. Why are so many commenters on youtube so shallow in their thinking? Eminem doesn't even need to rap any longer, money wise.  His old style is dead, it's never returning. Go listen to his old records if you want to hear it. Eminem is pretty much retired, so the fact that he's making anything at all, damn people. Remember, every rapper when their young is full of energy. That's how us young men are, we have lots of confusion and energy to burn when we're young. We just wanna beat everyone up and we go through various stages. But at 40 if your pants is still saggin and you're looking to put the rap game in a ' choke hold ' you clearly have a fucking identity crises. Let the 40 year old be a 40 year old, he's not a 20 something any more, thanks for reading.}
{STOP SAYING TUPAC AND BIGGIE ARE GREATS, THEY USE TO BE GREAT. GET OFF THERE DICK DAE DAE. THERE NOT IN THE CONVO BC THEY ARNT HERE. PEOPLE ALWAYS PRAISE AN ARTIST WHEN THEY DIE. LEAVE THE DEAD PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE, IN THE DIRT. ONLY PRAISE THEY DESERVE IS CHANGING THE GAME A LITTLE. THEYD BE GREAT IF THEY COULD STOP THEMSELVES FROM DIEING. BUT THEY DIDNT. }

You think Detroit is the shit, its not Nicosia is better. I shut your motor industry down with the type of a letter. Motown sound is dead, listen to MC Halloumi from the old people's home, better than a shaved blond head eminem clone. Why you have a girl doing a chorus, you think half the people would listen to you if it weren't for the eye of horus?}

{only white part.}
{I think that Royce is a Monster, damn.  Don Sean is a Very good rapper in my opinion. Danny Brown wow. Eminem is a storyteller. I Would like to thank The Hip Hop and Eminem. They saved my life from a dark period :')}
{I really respect and admire Em's material... New and old. I study and decipher a lot of his tracks, from Hellbound to Bully to The Apple to Underground to even Stronger Than I Was. I feel like his delivery here made it hard to understand what he was saying, which is tragic because he spat good lyrics with a crazy arsenal of rhymes. Even so, the message he was trying to deliver didn't really fit the tone of this song. The delivery made me feel sorry for him rather than the actual message of the verse, which is, "money didn't change me, bitch, my heart's still in Detroit!" But whatever, he murdered the song Vegas... So he made up for any iffy parts of Shady XV.}
{Big Sean has gotten sharper.  Great verse, best verse on the track.}

{So America is all heaven, according to Obooma's recent SOU lying speech, but why he didnt even bother to mention Detroit even in passing? There were times when everyone was dreaming to immigrate to America, now its just the opposite: Americans dream about immigrating to Europe (even the situation is not OK here too), Australia and even South America. Sorry, American folks: ure gonna reap just what u sowed.}

{TURKEY!}
{The guy that starts around 3:00 is annoying as damn.}

{Finally... Detroit :-)}
{awesomeee <3 eminem great job and all the other rappers great job <3 marshall you will always be my idol keep making music because your music is unik and original <3}
{Eminem hits all of the other "rappers"}
{Big Sean though}
{Just dont give a fuck about what people say about Em, no matter what he is G.O.A.T }
{Best verses in this song 1. Eminem 2. Big Sean 3. Royce Da 5`9 4.Trick Trick(Even though he ain't got a verse still better than Danny Brown.)}
{yeaaaaaaaa }
{Ниче не понял, объясните)}
{Lmao if this shit was put out in '02 when Em was at his peak, NO ONE would be complaining. I consider this to be one of Em's best verses/songs, and you would too if we were in '02. Just cause Em has put out some wack shit (although he has redeemed himself with MMLP2 and ShadyXV) doesn't mean you can hate on him for whatever shit he drops. You will not ever hear an MC as good as Em for a long while, so stfu and enjoy his music like the rest of us.}
{A M A Z I N G <3}
{Best verses :  1.Trick-Trick 2. Dej Loaf  3. Royce , Sean , Em and Danny}
{dayuuuuuuuuum c:  eminem <3 }
{Единственный голос который не режет уши это голос Эминема}
{Eminem is overated im sick of it heres a few rappers that are better Denace, JAY B, Rush Da Russian Rapper And Tewzen,The Real Maniac. Fuck it I cant enjoy eminems music anymore cause all of these fanboyz I DONT GIVE A HOOT.}
{Eminem is the best! It's not my opinion it's a fact. I agree that his new music is not on the same level as his old music but right now there isn't a better rapper than him. Today 95% of the mainstream rappers sound like lil wayne and rap only about big booties, sex and money. Eminem is one of the few rappers these days who is trying to keep it real. And for more than 15 years he is on the top! He is the best selling rapper of all time and the best selling artist for the last decade, which proves that he has been on the top for so long. Let's don't forget how he killed Jay-Z on Renegade. And in my opinion Jay-Z is one of the best out there. Yeah we never heard Eminem on the same song with Pac or Biggie or Big L but I'm sure that he would've been on the same level as they were or even better. So stop hating on Eminem or his fans and appreciate that he is still around giving us the oportunity to listen to real hip hop not some wack ass pussies like lil wayne, drake, tyga, 2 chainz ect.}
{Big Sean sounds like a young Eminem in this.}
{Definitely one of Em's best songs}
{I'll love eminem till i die... but this song :/ i didnt liked it much... sorry eminem....plz come back to old style }
{In This Song 1. Big Sean   2. EMINƎM 3. Royce 4. Danny Brown}
{About time...}
{Detroit takes the L!!! Everybody else wins!!}
{Why is Sean getting at this hate,  I personally think he bodied his verse,  his punchlines were on point,  his flow is weaker than the rest but still had a great verse}
{Islam is the religion of war.}
{Eminem has rhymed 'swedish fish' with 'penises'.... Ha!  Loved the beat, and living just outside the city, can feel the mood in these lyrics. Don't forget where you came from!}
{Dont care what anyone says...eminem owns rap...noone greater or better...noone can rhyme words like he does...some of his lyrics blow your mind if you stop and listen...eminem is definitely the best part in this video}
{This is weak shit}
{Pair up with a metal band and make a rock&rap song}
{somehow, i thought i would like it.. but something is not right.. the lyrics are forgettable and the hook is somewhat off.. Em, what happen?}
{google: Ante Gotovina, that is out hero :)}

{Eminem Rap God}
{Daaaaamn (:}

{Wow. This was surprisingly good. So different from this new swag bullshit, the beat and the flow are kind of redolent of good old days when Hip-Hop was real. }
{the best}
{"That's none of my business, but I don't sip tea" LOLOLOLOLOL ROYCE's verse}
{Good :-)}
{What kind of world do we live in where Big Sean spits a better verse than Eminem?!?!}
{Its funny to read " how em fall off or I want old slim shady " If you listen em all life just not from Recovery (its irrelevant when these fans said hey I want old slim shady) I enjoy every New song from Em, rythm flow its HIP HOP..  example Guts Over Fear..  I read comments on YT: " boring song, same lyrics, same ideas nothing new.. " after that come Shady XV and lot of hate on Em cause he hate ( another artist, ...) but THIS IS EM not pop weak shit, and now you hate Em cause you want Em from Recovery..  Maybe one day sorted out these " fake fans "}
{Eminem legend}

{Eminem Still The Best Rapper in this world  Lol }
{I wanted trick trick to rap that wouldve been sick}
{this is such a weird song. can't tell if I like it or not}
{Eminems flow is something else! The syllables and rhyming combined is truly amazing! He's mastered all kinds of rap and flow throughout his career. The guy deserves respect. Appreciate him whilst he's still here showing everyone how it's done!}
{Big Seans Verse was soo fucking good damm!}
{So many sad cunts Love you Em!}
{Hay algún español aki?}

{Kevin Macfly, he hasn't done a colas with Nate dog for years because Nate dog has been dead for years...}

{Vanilla Ice is da best rapper in da world.}
{Eminems part was the best}
{I love youuu eminem}
{açık ara en iyisi Eminem }
{all i see is 'muricans who don't know to appreciate the artist, complaining about what he wears, how he moves, detroit, and how this is not oldschool...that's sad, he has five ,or hoping, ten years more of making music, stfu and enjoy that, or go to "swag" music.}
{People have to understand HE'S MORE MATURE NOW. Rappers don't stay the same. He isn't that drugged up 20 something year old we once knew. Of course he raps different and rhymes different but he's still good that's what matters.}
{danny b and royce fucking KILLED IT}

{Thumbs up if you are more here for big Sean}
{Danny is fucking amazing 👏👍}
{Tupac at the end of the video !! omg i almost cried. 😢}
{I don't understand how people can possibly say eminem's only successful cuz he's white or say that he's overrated. He's the greatest rapper of all time and you are just hating if you say otherwise. Eminem's always inspired me, he's a huge inspiration. I'm a 16 year old rapper that earned 2,000 subscribers in less than a year. Check a couple of my songs out and tell me what you guys think!﻿}
{FF to 3:39}

{Danny Brown shits on everyone on this one}
{From a real Detroit nigga its DETROIT VS EVERYBODY}
{I was actually waiting for Trick Trick to spit some fiya... :/}
{I love Eminem and all but his lyrics just aren't the same. He rambles like a mad man just to get an easy rhyme. His lyrics aren't as meaningful as they used to be. He should've stopped making music after the Eminem Show. Although Encore was still pretty good, It just didn't have the same style as his previous ones. Not sure why his fans are so quick to defend him as still the best. He used to be the best in his time but I mean rap has evolved, not for the better, but there are a few artists like Lupe Fiasco or logic that still make good music. You guys need to stop living in denial and realize that Eminem kinda sucks now. }
{Plz do the bad guys mv :((( or twisted :3 your fan is still witting for them :3}
{Shit(}
{Куплет Эма как колыбельная... это круто}
{Есть кто русский?}
{Yet another proof  of WHY EMINEM IS THe BEST RAPPER there ever was or there ever will be... Yet another proof of WHY ONE's VERSE WONT MATTER if he/she is in a song with Em. Yet another proof of WHY NO-ONE CAN EVER MATCH Em's skill set of spit/write a Smarter SHIT. Yet another proof of WHAT A LYRICAL GENIUS and INTELLIGENT RAPPER Em is. Yet another Proof that EM HAS Already surpassed Pac/Biggie in this game. Yet another of WHY EM DESERVES THE TITLE "RAPGOD". _/\_ (PS: You wanna criticize, DAWG? Try a little mo') }

{He's turning off all you niggas that don't want to hear his words! Listen.shout out to mice and men.&}
{Why Eminem didn't put ELZHI on here?? He definitely would have murdered everyone}
{Danny brown went in if you listen to the words 😂 hard af to understand though}
{Big Sean murdered Eminem and Royce! Eminem was just rambling! I listened to the words! Props to BIG SEAN even though I never really liked him}
{Big Sean raps like a slow kid trying to read from a sheet.}
{It's funny cuz i really do bet that their are a lot of kids here who have never heard of the beastie boys.....a huge influence on eminem by the way....}

{royce >>>>}
{Don't even bother going down to the comment section....seriously....uhhh here you go, I told you!}
{Fucking sick}
{Can we please be done with DeJ Loaf .. dude is trash.}
{And this isn't just the only thing Eminem had very shitty songs on the MMLP2 I will admit most of the songs on the MMLP2 went hard as fuck but songs like headlights so far baby desperation berzerk and survival sucked FUCKING ass big time but then again this is my opinion and honestly in my opinion I think Eminem should retire from RAP music. He's getting old everyone gets old you FUCKS can't cheat death no matter how hard you try we will all get old and die face reality for once. And FUCK Eminem has FUCKING auto tune shit at the beginning and the beat sucks dick. Sorry Eminem you had you run you had your fun now please hang up the mic you know I'm white I'm almost eighteen years old but if I become a famous rapper which hopefully I do I'm going to FUCKING retire when I am 40 years old especially for white people they shouldn't be rapping past age 40 black rappers can RAP to age 60 if they want because black don't crack and it's true but white people do get old looking when they are 40 and older. If Eminem had became famous in 1995 he would have had sixteen Grammy's by now but no he became famous at age 26 what the FUCK racist black people who wouldn't let Eminem become a famous rapper sooner racist FUCKS.}
{Let me find out Iggy is ghost writing for Royce. Smh. His verse was horrible. The first half of his verse ain't even rhyme.}
{2:57 this guy fucking sucks at rapping}
{Eminem wouldn't be as successful as he is if Tupac was still alive. I mean Slim Shady LP came out in '98. Tupac was raised by Black Panthers. You people believe Tupac wouldve been cool rapping against white Elvis?   Hell No!}
{wow nice song.... eminem u are my hero.....your lyrics are superb.....i love u so much...}
{1-10 of the verses i like (in order of appearance) Royce-9 big sean-8 (even tho he is smaller than i imagined him from his name...) danny brown-4 (wtf he even say?) eminem-7 a solid 7... went for a while...  even though they were like the intro/outro/hook people and not rappers i'll give my 10 cents on dej loaf and trick trick as well: dej-7 (pretty good as far as hooks go, was a little auto tuned tho.. not a fan of that, not much to complain about) trick-4 (because it was kinda awkward with him standing there saying the outro like that..) overall i liked it, it's on my playlist but it's not my favourite, still better than katy perry.}
{Dej Loaf!!!!}
{I wanna see eminem and hops in}
{Eminem as always on top. Professional reciting. God rap.}
{I don't understand how people can possibly say eminem's only successful cuz he's white or say that he's overrated. He's the greatest rapper of all time and you are just hating if you say otherwise. Eminem's always inspired me, he's a huge inspiration. I'm a 16 year old rapper that earned 2,000 subscribers in less than a year. Check a couple of my songs out and tell me what you guys think!}
{i neva even heard of danny brown but he killed it, im a big em fan but brown killed.}
{Seriously I ain't being a dick for saying this I am speaking out in my own opinion this song sucks FUCK you I never said Eminem sucks he is a beast, a legend, the most illest Mc to have ever lived. But if you ask me I am very FUCKING pissed off that Dr. Dre did not help Eminem become famous sooner what should have happened is Dr. Dre immediately shoots Aftermath records through Interscope then signs Eminem on in march 1995. Eminem starts making the SLIM SHADY EP and releases it January 1 1996 at age 23, then on February 23 Eminem releases the SLIM SHADY LP an includes demon inside and till hell freezes over, then on may 23 1998 Eminem would release the MARSHALL MATHERS LP at age 25, may 26 1999 Eminem would release the EMIN3M SHOW at age 26, same year but later Eminem 8 mile soundtrack October 29 1999 he would release that soundtrack at age 27 he has a late birthday it is October 17, little later 8 mile movie November 6 1999 and he would be in that movie at age 27. The reason I wish Eminem's RAP career went like this instead and he becoming a famous rapper sooner really none of you know well I tell you why. Because that way Eminem could have been in songs on Eazy E's last rap album which was released on January 30 1996 same day N.W.A released it's greatest hits album Eminem could have also been on some songs on that album. Also if Eminem became famous in march 1995 then Eminem could have collaborated with 2PAC and NOTORIOUS B.I.G on 2pac's last two album's and notorious big's last RAP album. He could have also collaborated with BIG L before he died to. And I'm really FUCKING pissed at Dr. Dre for not making Eminem a famous rapper sooner. And I'm also pissed off at Eminem just a little bit though since Eminem did not become sooner famous as I'd hoped so Eminem should have released as many RAP album's as he could in his twenties. Like for instance Eminem SLIM SHADY LP released February 23 1999 at age 26 OK cool, not long after that the MARSHALL MATHERS LP may 23 2000 released at age 27 great. But the EMIN3M SHOW should have been released may 26 2001 at age 28, then Eminem 3NCORE should have been released may 26 2002 at age 29. But that's not even the FUCKING point Tue point is I wish Eminem became famous sooner period and I FUCKING hate that there's nothing I can do about if I could go back in time that would definitely be the first thing I would do make Eminem a famous rapper sooner. Also this way if Eminem became a famous rapper sooner he would have been able to have more rap album's in his twenties and more Grammy's.}
{cool}
{Eminem is Rap god, shut up haters !!.}
{top 4 rappers 1.lady gaga 2.katy perry 3.justin bieber 4.lil wayne}
{What the fuck is this? }
{I like how DeJ Loaf does a 5 second chorus and she's "featured" in the song I could sing that shit too with the auto tune she b usin wtf how much they pay her for that, and don't get me started on Danny brown(syndrome) jeez. Dope song tho lol}
{Honestly I don't think em did that bad. But some of these other artist are completely trash.. For example Def loaf just killed it for me with her annoying voice but she ain't the only one.. I don't get how some people listen to these artists.}
{Damn EM ...  Nothing less than absolute perfection ... }
{Big Sean had the best Verse !!!}
{Keep rapping and rhyming Eminem & everyone else. It's something you love and you're good at it. This song has some sick beats and the lyrics on Eminem's part are really great.}
{Danny Brown wins always}
{Why the fuck is danny brown on this shit????}
{Good shizzzzzzzzzz.}
{em is on point! and the second male rapper is kinds good!}
{I love Eminem> i will always do. But wtf is Big Sen doing here lol.}
{In my opinion, Em had the best flow and structured verse. Royce had a clean flow too with great word play. Big Sean was eh, he sounded boring with no energy but I liked the flow he picked up halfway through his verse. Never was a fan of Danny Brown due to his high pitch voice and slurred speech. Dej is just a hook lead with no real lyrical contribution to the song. And Trick Trick is featured just cus he was an outro? lol. Trick Trick to me is just a hype hook gangsta rapper with no real lyrical flow so why should Em send him the instrumental for a down grade version of this song? I feel like these collabs should only be done by musicians with structured lyrics and smooth flows. I don't care what anyone else thinks otherwise, it's "my opinion".}
{<3}
{this beat is craazzzy}
{Cant wait for someone to do a parody on this!}
{Meh, Eminem is usually good but he was kind of weak, Big Sean was weak as usual, the only dude that was any good on this was the first guy. }
{You ppl say this is not em and you all lost him. -.- PLS how long or many times will he tell y'all bout his frekin life. Btw buzz off ppl. He is and will always be the best so go ..!.. Off}
{i break the replay button...........}

{Сольные треки ему удаются куда лучше...}
{There was like 0.05% Eminiem in this. Like really he said like 1min of this song.}
{this shit WAY fucking better than ANYTHING Jay-Z evar did }
{Eminem has gone real hip hop now which is why you dont like him. Not no pop hip hop like Lil Wayne does. Down and dirty gangsta old school stuff. Real Eminem fans will love him no matter what he raps about or the style}
{Rap has gone to shit......this shit doesn't even rhyme or sound good. Rap used to be about the hardships in life and had a meaning "let our spirits live on in our lyrics". Now it's just about how fast you can spit meaningless words. }
{Hii}
{Eminem teared this up}
{Eminem😍😍😍😍}
{Big proof shirt at the end :"(((( R.I.P. Big proof. I imagined if u were still alive u would be part of this video, behind Em's back with D12 crew, supporting and part of representative of D.}

{I'd love to see a collaboration between Eminem and Esoteric(7L & Esoteric) from Army of the Pharaohs, they interviewed Wu Tang Clan member Inspectah Deck after they finished their album Czarface and he said after working with Esoteric, he considers him up there lyrically with Eminem.}
{Speechless...................so glad they did this but want them to remake the vid for guts over fear and they need to make a vid for twisted...Who wants to see Eminem sing in a video with yelawolf and skylar I mean it would be legendary but great job Em R.I.P.

{I was born and raised in Detroit! Six mile and Joseph Campau area! But, recently I lived in Fort Wayne, IN. I know this is a larger scale but this is like a rip off of CertiFLYYED's MY CITY song from Fort Wayne. I know it's not, but it feels the same way. I support Eminem and anything that uplifts Detroit but it just feels like I've seen it before.}
{I was born In Detroit}
{Big sean and Royce had the best verse and i never even heard of the nigga before. eminem doesn't even know what he is doing with his life i don't know why people love this nigga he is corny he hasn't made a good song in ages }
{Eminem как всегда охуенен! С возрастом только хорошеет.}
{Em has been trying too hard to rap fast and not rap hard It's like a fucking lambo. If you got something nice, you don't drive by extra fucking fast so that no one can see it...  if you got raw bars, you don't need to rap fast just to prove a point}
{i get chills whenever i hear eminem's voice }
{Cool but a guy on the hook would be better I think}
{yoooot yoooo......that call rap....awww aawww awwwwww aww awww awww aww}

{video and song are sick.  Em  still   got it.  Haters and some older fans aint liking his new flow but whatever.  Its his music .}
{ENIMINE PART WAS BETTER}
{Amazing !}
{All hail Eminem !! His lyrical flow is just SUPERB.}
{i like cows}
{EMINEM RAP GOD FAST VERSE AND GOOD LOOKING AS ALWAYS}
{I ain't from Detroit but I rep it}
{I can understand why some people don't like "Eminem's new flow," but I don't think it's all that bad. It's just different, and it should be. His delivery is way more subdued and (admittedly) monotonous-sounding than all the screaming on Recovery, and of course his voice or style aren't going to sound like what they were on his earlier albums. Times change, as do vocal cords. Personally, I wish he'd raise his voice more often, but the dryer sound he's been using is cool because it's this kind of laid-back, cocky thing that's like, "I'm gonna drop killer verses like it's no big deal because I can." He also uses the same flow pattern (or lack thereof) a lot, but I think it's kind of hard to do anything different when you're trying to pack so many multisyllabic rhymes and punchlines into one verse. I mean, you could probably swap out his verse in this song with one of the ones in "Guts Over Fear" or his verse on the Busta Rhymes song "Calm Down" or something, but I don't think that's a big deal. He's still super-clever and his wordplay is still miles above most other rappers I can think of. So yeah, he's not the same as he used to be, but that's not the same as saying he's not what he once was. P.S. If you're complaining that Eminem's become a "pop star," I assume you say that because he's made some radio-friendly hits and because he's not using as much shock value with his lyrics anymore. Here's my best guess as to why that is the case: he tried to shock and offend people at the beginning of his career to make people listen to him, but he doesn't really need to do that as much anymore because he has already secured a massive fanbase. He has also probably realized that there's value in making some radio-friendly hits that everyone can relate to. I don't think that's a bad thing, because he has lots of good messages that everyone should hear, but if he didn't make more pop-oriented songs to express those messages, not everyone would hear them because a lot of people don't like to hear a bunch of cussing and dark imagery in the music they listen to. In other words, he has grown up a little bit, and if you can't respect him for that, you clearly haven't.}
{I'm not sure if alot of you know this- but this song is very meaninful and holds alot of significance to all the artists featured in it. They all relate to the struggle as one and all have roots starting from Detroit. }
{That fucking chorus with the brass.. Its so fucking good and unique. This is amazing}
{Shoutout to the D it's yall time this great I'm glad they turned they negatives into positives that's wussup and if you've got time I'm new at music got my first video on my page if you could check me out show me some love I'm trying my hand at music but I want to make music with meaning but thank you to people who are giving me a chance}
{You know what sucks? A great song is made with nothing but rappers straight up rapping, and all people do in the comments is complain about Eminem. "Dickriding," "Typical Stan," "Em is overrated." Honestly, just enjoy the music. Goddamn.}

{fuck it Eminem has definitely...NOT fallen off how many rappers do you know that used to rhyme fast and now starting to slowly fall off and get slower or put all intelligence and great punchlines and now dont really have any that are as good and can never be topped again, Eminem reversed the shit used to rhyme fast around 88 with his rare songs and songs like "take the whole world with me" hes at his original pace but it takes alot of hard work to go from a pace that was medium to go as fast and as smart as his rhymes are now hes still the same Eminem and hasnt changed, the "Real Eminem Fans" know that. dont judge the muhfucka for getting his life together and setting priorities straight if he didnt get clean he probabaly would've died of an overdose and wouldnt be able to make as many great, humorous songs that we all like. IGAF if im dick riding, haters dick ride their idols so im not the only asshole here.}
{Can everyone stop bitching on who's the best rapper? Its just music enjoy it.}
{1:59 No more Ariana?}
{shady. my God. still got it.}
{good apart from the odb wanabe who the fuck and what the fuck is he}
{I love u eminem plz resend to me I love your vids I love rap god I can do the leaquics}
{all these rappers coming out and posting on this video saying they sound like eminem...but they don't... I DO....AND I FUCKIN HATE IT!!!  it sucks cuz i'll never be taken seriously even tho i try to do completely different flows, i've tried doing different voice, rapping about different things, and that's all people can see. "wow you sound like eminem"  Im over it. Gonna start rapping in an australian accent or somthin lol.}
{Love the song but Danny Brown verse was fucking horrible}
{Omg I adore you all}
{This is a classic anthem that I hope will be remembered ten years from now there should be a mega remix to this song with many talented Detroit mcs.  I am not from Detroit myself but I like the way the people on this song rep for where they came from hard.}
{im here only for marshall fuck u all haters}
{Every major city need one of these}
{да ну страшная какая-то девка,но классный голос и я не обращаю внимания на это)}
{EMINEM ES EL DIOS DEL RAP , ACTUALMENTE (Y) }
{After Big Sean Part , couldn't understand shitttttttt}
{Y do people hate on em be cuz ur still in trailer and he moved uptown}
{Lame music video.}
{Eminem killed that shit}
{Yes. Another one .(Eminem) love you}
{Tech n9ne said eminem would get a verse on world wide choppers 2}
{Its a new fad on the internet to criticize eminem for stupid reasons. People saying he doesn't have a good flow and then listening to Iggy Azalea. They do it just to sound cool and show how much gangsta rap they listen to. Lol. The point is that, get it straight, into your heads, eminem's flow is better than all rappers *alive*. Better than Tech N9ne. WAY BETTER THAN NAS.  Everyone changes with age. Linkin park is no longer the same as it used to be years back. If you think eminem would go back to slim shady and make songs about doing drugs after being treated for it, you are a fool. And the funny part is, the people who criticize him do not actually buy his albums. His music has changed with time, but one thing has not changed yet. HE STILL DON'T GIVE A _______.}
{Обожаю Eminem'a}
{who is that annoying ass rapper that went after big sean ? his voice irks me lol}
{Saw 50 Shades of Grey coming a mile away.}
{detroit was nice before the blacks moved in}
{I don't think Dej Loaf from Detroit.... She came outa knowhere too fast}
{Yall ever heard of creative Expression,  I like how Em has progressed his style... trying new things is a good thing... yall just stuck on stupid. Repetitive ass bitches...}
{SHADY #1 from CHILE !!}
{Holy fuck!}
{I don't care about what anyone has to say, Eminem is a great rapper. Everybody did good on this song and if u didn't like it then click the dislike button and be on your way. No one wants to hear your reviews or reports because we don't care. The sooner you trolls realize it the better.}
{RAP GOD!!!}
{This is fucking sad, if you want too hear REAL RAP from Detroit check out the song "The Left - Reporting Live (Ft. Guilty Simpson)" OR "Apollo Brown & Guilty Simpson - Reputation" }
{Fuck i love danny brown. Fuck what all you think.}
{Yes!!}
{U have ur opin I have mine}
{Eminem you fell off years ago. It's time to retire man.....}
{Em is the best rapper ever by far}
{more like LA vs everybody}
{It's So Cold In The D.}
{People who say em fell off need to listen to this.}
{Wow I mean like...}
{Eminem... I love you man but your 42 going on 43 its that time..}
{Big sean verse was lame}
{Sooooo where.has this.big sean been}
{Fuck Dej Loaf, I wanted to hear Trick Trick go in... Everyone else killed it though.}
{The industry don't wanna see us lol. We some monsters n all they looking 4 is puppets lol}
{1. Don't Trick Trick got grand kids to babysit? The hell he's doing in the video? 2. Dude at 2:56 looks/behaves like a fiend, and I could barely understand what he was saying. 3. Surprised Em got Big Sean on the track. The best rapper after him and Royce in the D is probably Calicoe (landslide); why he ain't on it? This is one track em should have left on the cutting room floor, sorry.}
{Not gonna lie. Every person on this song killed their verse (in the good way).}
{To me personally, take out big sean=best song 2009}
{I like Eminem BUT i prefer Esoteric.}
{danny went and snapped on this tho!!! best verse on it!!}
{Damn em just kills man that's why he's number 1}
{Damn well done}
{3:39 to replay Eminem 0:11 for Royce da 5'9" 1:14 for Big Sean 2:55 for Danny Brown 5:28 for Trick Trick}
{I wish Trick would've actually gotten his own verse.}
{TRICK TRICK!!!!}
{Damn this is sick}
{Damn  well done}
{eminem is a chump nowadays. shoulda let ICP in there concidering they squashed the beef and proof shouted them out before he died... they are detroit legends to no matter what anyone says}
{This fire}
{Not tryin'na b a h8r, but bein' from the D themselves is the only reason an' way that sean an' brown would have evr gotten on a track w Em; I would have loved 2 hear Dej an' Trick spit 2... madd ppl always talk about how Em fell off an' he's gone 2 mainstream an' his flow ain't the same, etc etc yet he remains 1 of the most talked about MCs in the Hip-Hop community 2 this day... I feel like he brought back his crazy ass lyrical/syllable scheme freestyle flow an' Slim Shady subject matter an' content wen he did the Shady Cxvpher an' released ShadyXV, which might explain y anybody who started listening 2 him after Recovery prolly can't keep up w his verses... I won't evn lie, sometimes I'll evn listen 2 his verses an' catch myself reacting like I have no clue wtf he's saying but after a few more listens I can keep up w his rhythm an' he actually says some over-the-top shit... If Trick an' the Good Squad actually do throw 2gether a remix w this beat them dudes bettr kill that joint off so that no other rapper can reuse the beat... Detroit All Day and Forever!!!}
{No desmerito el gran trabajo de estos raperos cada uno tiene su estilo, pero diablos... Eminem esta en otro nivel, es el amo sin duda uno de los mejores de toda la historia!}
{EM.}
{still not as good as Run the Jewels. }
{Why do you guys hate Eminem so much ? He's 42 not a drug addict and the song is about he's past in Detroit , so he's lyric is exactly fits the song. So get over your fits and accept Eminem is over he's drug days and more matured. Thanks for reading .}
{Style old school wow!}
{I feel as if this song should belong in 2008.}
{This is like watching the slow death of punk when if turned into Emo Crap. Rap is dead}
{Danny Brown and Eminem in the same track? What a treat!}
{"eminem sucks" no hes just done it all. Imagine if biggie or tupac were still alive doing their 28th album. It would get pretty boring as well.}
{How come Royce never shows up on these high profile songs? His bars in PRyhme were crazy and these were nothing to get hype about. Em is old and just trying to stay relevant, Big Seans voice didn't go well with this beat (he sounds like a little kid), and I couldn't take Danny Brown serious. Disclaimer: I'm a fan of Royce and Danny Brown, so this isn't me attacking them, just my thoughts. You could think for a song of this caliber (basically calling all other major cities out) that they would have had better verses or something to actually get you hyped.}
{great video... love the showed off detroit so well}
{Big Sean had the best verse}
{Im Stan.}
{lol there was no reason to make this song}
{Kevin McFly he hasnt collaborated with Nate Dogg cause Nate Dogg is DEAD}
{like if you're from the D}

{Dope song but Dej Loaf is TRASH!}
{Eminem Best Rapper singer (Brazil Observing Releases) \ õ /}
{Every comment on Eminems shit nowadays is about how much he's changed and people arguing with each other about whether he's fallen off or not and stuff like that....}
{im going to skip this and watch Ed, Edd n Eddy}
{white people, if you wish to say the n word, you can go to this site:  pay 5$ a month or more depending on how white you are and freely be able to say the so much desired word. Have Fun!!}
{wtf Is all this why are the views so low. is this how fucked up teens have become, what has our society come to. im only 15 and I know eminem still remains the best rapper. I bought this album and it was really something great butt wtf where are all the views ppl rather jerk off to miley cyrus' wrecking ball video or some shit than listening to good music? that's just silly}
{Thank god Dej Loaf didn't get anything more than a slight hook or she would of ruined it.}
{Big Sean matured instantly when he put on those glasses. He turned into some kind of street philosopher.}
{Eminem wack 👊}
{!!!!!}
{i fucking loved it}
{This remind me of 4 Brothers . who agrees?}
{the comeback in Detroit is SO real. Place is legit. }
{Whatcha lookin at ? it's just a fuckin post !}
{I was an eminem fan at the age of 12 and now i'm 28. He was way better back then and now I think he is just trying to stay relevant for his fans sake. Most artist are tired of rapping but they are afraid of becoming forgotten about. Once you leave the spotlight nobody really cares about you even if you are super rich. There are a few like pac, micheal jackson and other noted rock stars that live on everyday but for the average successful rapper one you leave that main stage it's over. }
{Eminem got me into rap music. I never really listened to it before, but after hearing some of his most rescent stuff ive since started going back to older stuff, and branching out into other artists.  I dont know whos the "best" or "worst" rappers, but from my limited experience, you either like the song or you dont, the only people that can critique this stuff on a technical are the people who can do it themselves, and at that point us lamen need to step off and just enjoy the music.}
{Em's verse is better than anything on marshal mather's LP2 sadly..=/}
{Eminem isn't from Detroit wtf? If you little white boys were real fans you would no it bitches}
{THAT WAS FUCKIN FIRE WOOOOOOOO!!!! Shit gave me chills.}
{all you people saying eminem is trash compared to lil wayne and them least he dont rap anout pussy money and weed all the time}
{Yayy ive been waiting for this <3 I just skiped to ems part *STAN FOREVER* and btw to all of you -HIP HOP IS NOT DEAD-}
{Eminem is a beast a monster truly amazing 😎😎😎😎}
{3:40 You can thank me later.}
{Could any one understand trick trick ?}
{Eminem Canta muito , sou fan , e no Brazil tem muitos fans tambem , e sempre vou ser um <3 melhor rapper kkk claro os outros são foda tambem , mas so mais Eminem, FOREVER }
{Man, they sure _love_ the D.}
{people saying em has lost it I don't know man. he seems allot different he raps allot different now so I get that some people don't like him but I think he's still a amazing talented rapper and I will still backup the fact that he's one of the best. his rhymes and verses are one of a kind man.}
{Тут есть русские которые слушают Eminem'a ?}
{wheres Detroit che}
{Wow this is fucking good.}
{props @eminem, made me a fan again with this track!  }
{Who's the second guy singing not counting the girl}

{에미넴 갓}
{Big Sean had the best verse..}
{muito foda <3}
{Eminem has the greatest rapes that you can't help to rap along to. 👌}
{Big Sean's verse tho}
{Second verse was boring as hell, but the next guy killed it. 3/10}
{Why is everyone saying he is getting dull and boring . He schooled everyone in this and every other video. He is still the same white rapper like he always has been. He is #1 and would rap out biggie and 2 Pac ..... #RapGod}
{Too fast camera movements, too fast clips absolutely not fitting in with the music and some cuts delayed was the video editor on speed or something? WTF! It is suppose to flow with the music!}
{Danny Brown had the best verse}
{Danny Brown is a good rapper but holy fuck his voice is annoying}
{Cool}
{Eminem fans are like pewdiepie fans they think he is the best and attack other people with a different mind set ....}
{I would really appreciate it if some of you could take 5 mins to fill out my survey on nutrition and consumer shopping habits. I would really appreciate it! Thanks! }
{Welp Detroit Vs. Inglewood, CA. The stakes are high. But I think me and my team can do it and the rest of the unexplored talent in Cali. }

{505 people are deaf.}
{Like the song and nice team work on this song but I don't like Big Sean part because he is trying to rap but he is just talking. I don't think he is even a rapper cuz he can't rap. Well at let's nothing good but other then that I like it #HIPHOP}
{Illuminati!!!}
{This is cool... good job every1}
{The Best Rapper  <3    Brazil }
{lmfao Detroit is shit}
{Look I'm not a Stan on Eminem's dick or anything. Eminem for 42 can still rap his ass off. I've been listing to marshall since 03. Old shit new shit I've listened to probably every song. Yes I agree his old flow and lyrics were defiantly better but like I said he can still rap his ass off. You actually have to listen to the lyrics ... Hell even watch a lyrics video because he has a couple nice punchlines here and there. Big Sean still murderd everyone on this though lol.}
{Trash}
{Its good to see em with a hoodie back in the dirty}
{Em is back}
{DETRIOT BABY}
{Grime is better.}
{Milwuakee is really segregated too  and all those people who are hating on eminem just leave nobody asked you to watch this}
{It's like if he's freestyling now.}
{Big Sean is insanely talented. His flow is so strong, and his lyrics are good. Even though he is a pretty big name rapper I think he deserves to be even bigger. I'm glad the song "I don't fuck with you" increased his popularity cause he deserves it, but he has much better songs then that one, it just has a good beat.}
{I love em, but shady xv was trash. Soz for voicing my opinion for those who disagree}
{Eminem killed it}
{3:40 }
{I'm not feeling hook/chorus parts.. She sounds annoying Cx Is it just me?}
{REAL SH#T EMINEM STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM NOT THAT FAKE ASS DRAKE }
{F#UCK the haters man. Eminem is real and has never changed he always tells a great story about his life and a lot of things he talks about people can relate to him as-well of what they are going through man. Before anyone says I'm dick riding I'm not just because a say he is one of my favorite rappers if not favorite and I can relate to some of the stuff he talks about that's not dick riding at all. Lets face it right at least Eminem talks about real SH#T man in said of these fake ass rappers out today who just talk a load of BS all the time about Guns,Cars.Girls,Money that SH#T to me just gets boring after a while hearing the same crap over and over again I mean rap about something else four once man.}
{Killers!..}
{love seeing em and royce together but what ever happen to obie he hasnt been featured on nothin for years }
{Sean went in 😱}
{My city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring. WTF Danny Brown lol.}
{wtf is this shit?}
{I have no idea why, but I actually enjoy this song alot. }
{Big Sean murked this ain't goin lie}
{I love eminem}
{Eminem with Multi-syllable +spitting fire}
{That big Sean verse was Litt !!}
{In this video eminem no is the star?}
{didnt realise this was shot in 1948}
{Dej Loaf sucks. She shouldn't be making music.}
{Danny brown looks exactly as he sounds lol}
{Eminem im very thankful for you visiting gage it was his last wish R.I.P. Gage god bless eminem.}
{Swag}
{I may have been a metro detroit upper middle class white kid my whole life, but I stand by Detroit with all of my heart. It is my dream to see this city resurge, my dad constantly tells me about how amazing that city was back when he was young and it saddens me to see that it is a ghost of its former self. I love Detroit and I want to help it back to its feet.}
{I think my problem with this new eminem is that he sounds like a pussy hahaha like he doesn't record mutliple tracks of his voice anymore it doesn't sound like he should he just sounds nasily and it's not fun to listen to}
{I cant take nobody serious with them detroit vs everybody shirts}
{ALBANIA ♥ }
{Lmfao Detroit sucks. If I was from there, I'd move out as soon as possible.}
{The youtube comments make me want to shoot myself. I guess people aren't aloud to enjoy what they want to anymore. }
{Royce da 5'9" <3}
{This song would have been better as just Danny brown Vs everybody. seeing he is the only one with a good verse. }
{#2 sucks}
{Yelawolf is the only hope left}
{WHO THE FUCK DISSLIKED THIS !!!!!!!!!!!}
{Str8 trash ur falling off.. should just call u m&m the old u falling of like pieces.. should have stop you're a legend in rap hip hop stay that way}
{Really hope Strange replies with KC vs. Everybody.  It could create a pretty badass series of cyphers.}
{I love his songs}
{One Word: DOPE}
{Under 1000000 club}
{If eminem was only successful because he is white then I guess Logic, Mac Miller, G eazy, MGK, Action Bronson and many other white rappers are successful because their white too? Get outta here kids.}
{Fucking dope. Kinda wish D12, Obie, Twiztid, Gordy, Boldy, Blaze, Elzhi, Black Milk, Guilty Simpson, ABK, and R.O.C. would've made appearances. Big Sean went harder than expected. Danny, Royce, and Em killed it as always. Never heard of Dej before.}
{Eminem stop talking about Sweden in your songs and get the fuck over here instead!}
{PLEASE DISLIKE MY VIDEOS IM FUCKING RUSSIAN KID}
{MARSHALL I KNOW HOW YOU AND EVERY ONE IN DETROIT IS GOING THROUGH IT IS LIKE IN MOST PARTS IN TEXAS THAT THE CITY HALL OF SAN ANTONIO IS JUST THROWING PEOPLE OUT LIKE THERE TRASH}
{Where can I get that proof t shirt at the end? RIP big proof}
{Dios del rap que excelente canción}
{EXCELLENT }
{Great song and Great Music video as-well. Man Royce da 5'9's flow on this beat is sick man it goes so well could of listen to just him on it. In my opinion it is the best song of the SHADY XV album and tell you what when Eminem and slaughterhouse come together on songs if that's all of them or not they both make great music man. Its like as-well when 50 cent is doing songs with Eminem or G-unit in my opinion that's were 50 Cent shines he just seems to up his game all the time when he is with them.}
{Eminem's part is a music orgasm}
{we've survived Encore, his accent on Relapse, his Rihanna/Weezy/Dreezy/Pink/Sia collabz and mainly STRONGER THAN I WAS, so we'll swallow his too lyrically constructive robotic flow with pleasure. }
{they all wearin timberlands that are laced}
{Why do we watch music video's? '}
{Eminem is as dope as he has ever been, shady xv was dope and if you don't like him at the least you have to respect him if you don't, you shouldn't listen to rap because you dont know shit about rap}
{Cuz im adrain Peterson, when hes ragin and heated and on the way to go beat his kid}
{They finally made the music video...}
{BIG SEAN BRUH he the best n u all now it}
{OMG *------*}
{I heard this song when I was on Pandora, had to check out this music video. Eminem got almost every rapper or hip-hop artist of Detroit in this, and didn't know my dude had his record company}
{Best for last eminem}
{My 5 Fav Rappers 1. Eminem 2. Slim Shady 3. B-Rabbit 4. Marshall Mathers 5. The white guy from D-12}
{The guy at 1:37 should play young Ice Cube in Straight Outta Compton movie. lol}
{I find it funny when people use a video on youtube to get really mad and just spew bullshit all over the comment section. Voice your opinion, that's cool. It's a different story when you're just slandering something with no respect whatsoever to the artist and the other people commenting. As for the video, it doesn't really blow me away. I love the whole idea and concept behind the song though. A different hook would have worked better in my opinion. }
{BR POHA !}
{Em you need Dr.dre to do you classic beats, cmon man!!!}
{im pretty sure Detroit would loose vs everybody. ... no but really whats the point of this song.}
{Eminem wasn't enough to save this song... RIP.}

{Eminem is my favorite rapper, but Royce's verse was the best...}
{The woman cant sing}
{Watch me put lansing michigan on the map}
{Big Sean had the best verse}
{This is dope. Danny will always make the song imo tho}
{Eminem the best keep make music like this <3}
{Haters everywhere... Shut up and listen to the music! If you don't like this shit, you can go to listen something else. You judge the flow and the beat and that's fine... but why insult? "Racism is not dead as long as there will be an Hitler in each of you". Fuck off!}

{Rap Gods!}
{Everybodys flow was wack af except for Em he did his shit fr. But I was disappointed in Big Sean and Danny Brown Royce da 5"9 too.  I wasn't convinced  that they really was going hard for Detroit.}

{Wow, this really sucked. I wanted to like this so bad, especially Eminem part, but I think that is what killed it. Ugh. Maybe if I replay it}
{You fuckin suck}
{Just listened. Em's verse was tight as always don't understand the hate..well it's by EM haters so I guess I understand}
{  BEST SONG}
{this track blows the dicks of every OG rap artist out there who actually has skill but isn't noticed because everyone thinks his shit is older than the 90's but hell id take any track from the 90's and early 2000's over this shit and everything everyone puts out these days. is this even Eminem? feels so full of bullshit and new school shit seems like its washed up, re hashed shit, been the same sound since 2012, lots of mono toned, fast horse shit or that singing shit he went through. like what the fuck? did your anger, fuel, fire.. burn out? seems like it. nas was right, raps dead. this new school poprapdubsteptechno shit is in, whatever the fuck it even is. nobody even really likes it they just bump it because its popular, nobody listens to the music anymore all they care about is the name, you could write a track saying one word, the rest is everyone else in the song and the beat and everyone would go "yo u hear that new Eminem track? shits dope" honestly either just fuckin quit and stop wasting everyones time and make way for the next truly good artist or hmm I dunno, make something good for a change? damn. you've showed us your collection of just random shit wrote down on everything from notebooks to napkins, im sure you've got some gems in there somewhere that a fifty times the track this is or any other shit you've put out in the last 3-5 years. get your shit together man what are you doing.}

{I prefer to be a stan than one of those idiotic lil wayne and drake bitch ass fan  eminem is even better than tupac ...people will disagree...because pac is dead ..and you wanna show respect  but lets be honest......eminem spits it better than every other rapper ...even dre even jay z even nas  there's a reason why he's the best selling artist of the decade  eminem's music and the way it connects with hus fans is incredible. ...he doesn't rap about money or cars or all those other bullshit  he raps about life, something people can relate to so stfu ...eminem is best}
{03:38}
{Glad to see they made a song for the D. This isn't a dick riding contest people, it's about showing love for Detroit}
{stop complaining on the  comments, enjoy the good fucking music fellas }
{Beast Coast vs Everybody song?}
{All of them killed it. I'm just not a fan of Danny Brown's delivery. Does anyone have a clue what he's saying?}
{I expected a bunch of "Oh wow i love this song" or "Nah man this song ain't too great" or "I liked the part where" but instead theres only "Stans only like Eminem cuz he's white".   -.- You fucking people these days. Fans like what they wanna like. It's always a constant battle of who's better, when there really is no one who is better. It's a music preference, there's no right or wrong. It's like food. Maybe you don't like steak but love vegetables and maybe you like strawberries and not apples. That doesn't mean they are bad foods cuz if they were bad nobody would eat them. Get my drift?}
{Royce D 59}
{I love how no one said anything about big sean}
{Em is the 1st white rapper that cracked the hip hop code and made a respectable place in black people's heart. Dude opened the gateway for every up coming MC with the same color which *makes'Em a historical figure.}
{This shit goes hard 🔥🔥}
{No offence eminent was by far the best}
{Lecrae's freestyle was better then this...}
{Эминем ахуенен!!!!}
{What's a rappers favorite candy? Eminems. }
{top five rapper in Detroit Eminem big herk big sean cash kidd calicoe}
{i miss the old school em! bring back som funky beats by dre and your good old flow and not to mention the dirty lyrics.}
{I'm not feeling it. Danny Brown went in though.}
{Best verses  1.Royce 2.Em  3.Sean 4.Danny Its just imo Ems verse and Seans verse are in a tie for two cause em was basically telling a story instead of going in like the rest of them}
{Top 5 rappers: Lecrae Tedashii Andy Mineo Trip Lee And Eminem, when he was good...}
{sickest rap video ive ever seen}
{yo i need subtitles}
{I only came for Danny Brown}
{I love this!!! All the verses are amazing and the video too!}
{People must understand that most of us like Eminem. But that doesn't mean that we love all his songs man. We just fucking love most of them. We can listen to different rappers and respect them. That doesn't mean Eminem fans suck dick, damn. Maybe nowadays, we ain't the same generation anymore, and most of us are just TIRED to Be Eminem fans, that's it. You have to admit it that this white guy is rap master. He just lives it, and we ain't like him. Nobody can be the best constantely in this art. That art is his Passion man, and i have to admit that he wasn't inspiring me anymore since 2010. But before his music was something of different... something i didn't use to hear to, something i was sick of..... . I want to say that since 2010 he started to make "shit". This song is a lil bit different.. it has something. But i can't descibe what.... Just don't remember that this guy was the best for a long period of time and he was inspiring most of us. So just don't say shit about him. He still must be respected at least for what he has done maaayn.}
{It's amazing how overrated big sean is, he's so bad..}
{eminem just got mad flow that few rappers can match }
{ok, that was DOPE!}
{<3 <3 <3 }
{ahhh shit, already dropped an AP beating his kid line. haha}
{Hands down, Danny Brown got the best verse}
{They should have replace the dude who went after big sean with payroll from doughboys cashout}
{Eminem did some crazy rap on this. Understood most of it. Need to slow it down. Very fast.}
{White people like Eminem because he's white so let's cut the bs...Proof was just as nice so is Royce and Obie Trice... Em is dope but he's not the greatest of all time.. album sales really? Shit Nelly sold records, Bow Wow sold records... Macklemore won grammys gtfoh}
{Trick Trick's entourage looks MEAN as hell}
{A lot of eminem videos are full of wanna be gangsters in the comment section.:/}
{Badboyrome1}
{Actually asshole i am a stan i hate kim the song and more i am a huge fan of eminem and i dont do crazy shit for him just a normal fucking person}
{eminem is good but people who are black don't like or talk shit bu have to listen to his lyrics like just listen we don't like eminem because he's white if he was black I would still like him just how I ike him now }
{2:56 to 3:37 ruins the song imo}
{Big Sean has the weakest flow in the game. The beat was overriding him.}
{is danny brown rapping in english?}
{terrible only royce and danny bars were ight rest was garbage }
{The realist shit on this song was trick trick talking good lord}
{Royce crushed it}
{Royce da 5'9" sounds so autotuned its not even funny anymore.}
{this is clear to me: so many rappers here but one and only Eminem a.k.a my inspiration kills it. Eminem part, is the best. i would like to hear this song only by eminem cause the beat is good it would've been better with Slim's voice alone}
{Royce had the best verse}
{Big Sean verse: "See im never call and collect I call to collect My homie wanted a chevy so I put my dog in a vet".  just in case yall didn't catch that fire.}
{This song is shit Fucking bored! Eminem and maybe royce are good but the rest sucks}
{would the real slim shady fans , please stand up and tell the hating bitches to stfu}
{Wtf that is not the same Danny Brown from 1996 How do you want it.}
{Eminem and the rest of slaughterhouse = TRASH}
{Royce and Danny Brown killed it here. }
{CRACK IN THE MUSIC}
{Clearly Em killed it!... big Sean was Awesome and Royce too.... loved these three... and eminem's style is like crazy man...}
{I like the song but i don't like the video that much. I'm a huge Eminem fan but i think that his music videos have sucked since headlights. I hope that he makes more but i also hope that he makes them like his old ones. His old ones were like mini movies with the quality and story telling and now it's watching them stand there with some random footage.}
{The 2nd dude sounds like young slim shady  maybe it's my earphones xD}
{any one else have to look up the lyrics to understand the third guy(sorry dont know his name) but hold on before you starting hate. i looked it up and now i understand and it is really good. they all killed this shit. been waiting for this song for 2 months}
{Eminem is the best.}
{Sick video, would be dope to see other cities reply, especially wit that LA vs Everybody pic Snoop put up. I got an EP on my channel called 'The High School Genius EP', check out a track on it called 'High School' and if you like it go head and give the whole EP a listen! Much love}
{My question is can anyone understand what Danny Brown said LOL.}
{Chicago Vs. Everybody}

{Everyone talk about L.A. and York but Detroit got some good elements in the game too. I love how rappers be reppin' where they're from. Can't wait for "L.A. vs Everybody" too heard it's dropping soon And stop talking shit about Eminem he's a legend.}

{Total lip sinking}
{im here for danny.}
{God Danny Brown is fucking annoying}
{Aaaaahh 😃😭}
{Royce I think had a great verse that suited the beat, and I enjoy listening to his part the best but he didn't have the most complex verse on here, I would say big Sean had the most complex verse but I personally don't like his flow}
{GOAT}
{Your awesome eminem and so am I}
{I thought his him and Iggy Azalea would go good XD but he has children and all that.....}
{danny brown x shady would be sivck}
{ShadyXV was shit. My opinion best album right now 2014 Forest Hills Drive}
{l}
{I don't understand why people tend to come hate on musicians art, Eminem is the one who killed this whole track, yet everyone went hard, this is Big Sean's only badass verse, you're not gonna tell me he's an AMAZING rapper, so stop getting mad cause people liked Em's verse better, now, I'm not dick riding, I'm just saying, everyone has their opinions, some think royce went harder, some think danny did, some think sean did, some thimk loaf did, some did em did, so just enjoy this song, cause it's been a while since rap had a song that went this hard!}

{Eminem's part was good}
{Henry The Hatter is about to get really busy.... I like Danny Brown, never heard him before this....Good stuff.}
{I'm a big fan of Eminem, I'm a stan. But, I admit that it flow it is ultimately bland, on this bead was not very good, if he wants to do a different flow, to return as the Infinite times! Eminem is a guy who loves the city of Detroit and I learned to admire even here by far (Curitiba city, Brazil). I hope this beautiful city to recover and hope one day to visit Detroit! Eminem is far from its peak, but his proposal is not currently do more RAP POP but the RAP Classic, this song is very good and as I said Eminem's verse was not the best, my opinion is that the Big Sean did the best verse. PEACE}
{that chorus is cringe worthy}
{Best rappers  - Eminem - Slim Shady - Marshall Mather - The white guy in group D12}

{I understood nothing from Danny Browns part.}
{Can someone tell me who are Danny Brown and Dej Loaf in this video. Thanks!}
{How the fuck did Danny brown become successful.}
{Eminem was like fuck it, lemme just keep spitting to the end of the song. About like 5 or 6 times i thought he was gonna stop but he still continued...that's some amazing shit right there. He did it in a couple of other songs too, love it when he does that}
{Why is everyone hating on eminem ?}
{I'm honestly impressed that they came up with an anthem for Detroit. All verses, equally, were great for me. Hands down. }
{Estupenda canción, sin duda el mejor mc de todos.}
{Royce is the only rapper that outshines Em when he does songs with other rappers, renegade, vegas now this.}
{Good song. Good video. Yet they praise detroit. Too bad it isn't a good city like Minneapolis or something or like Seattle. Its such a shithole city.}
{h8}
{Why always dudes talk shit about stans .. ? Yeah I'm Stan ..But i don't dickride Eminem .. I think Eminem is the best rapper ever .. But I respect other rappers and their fans .. Like 2pac fans eating shit about Eminem he is white , did u know that 2pac was against racism..Eminem favorite rappers are 2pac and Biggie .. If was 2pac still alive he would make so many songs with Eminem .. But you don't have brain to understand that .. That's all i've got to say . Thank you I'm outie .. ! }

{Eminem bruh just marry me}
{Eminem yaaaa ben seni yerim yerim şu tipe bak :) bu arada TÜRKİYE'den S.A}
{All I heard was "Mush her face into the Entertainment Centre." LMAO}
{Sean Actually surprised me on this. Him and Royce top 2 on this, but i feel they all came with it}
{Why am I not surprised Danny looks like that?}
{Like if you think shady should sign hopsin, kendrick lamar, and logic!}
{Goosebumps! .......P rock we in this bish now}
{De legend about angry blonde is comeing back}
{Big sean said my boy wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet. Does that mean he made his dog fight for money?}
{Big Sean & Danny Brown, DAMN!!!}
{sempre al top! em!}
{YEEEEESSSSS}
{Royce's verse>}
{This was a dope video}
{Awsome}
{Not bad, em is being em, but I am not a fan of that flow he uses in his recent songs including this one, Royce and Sean were cool, which trick would've given us a verse}
{For me the best verse is Royce's verse.}
{that girl ruins the whole song}
{AWESOME}
{Most these rappers arent that good thats why eminem sounds a little better, in general he is better than these guys anyway,  i am a huge eminem fan so dont jump on my ass im just saying that this song wasnt much of a test. But we are about to see if eminem can hang or not because For those who dont know... he is going to be on Worldwide Choppers 2.}
{Here is a couple of words from a REAL STAN, Not the stan that has Eminems dick as a forever ring, I want you real Eminem fans to wake the fuck up, Eminem has lost it, he lost his flow and his wordplay. His Last good album was recovery. Eminem raps to just rhyme now a days. he is not that angry poor blonde who use to rap about 100% Truth and said it funny. he is now an old man that is trying to fit in with this fucked up music industry, where every rapper just needs to shut the fuck up and sit down. because there either trying to rap about stuff nobody gives a fuck about, with catchy beats to get kids attention. or trying way to hard to be like tupac and biggie. I Still Like Eminem He Is My favorite Rapper of all time, still but he is not himself no more. only a real stan will know that Eminem lost it.}
{EMINEM is the bestt  ;)}
{Big Sean had the best verse for sure followed by Royce}
{Черный красавчик!}
{Can't understand Danny Brown}
{None of y'all want to be from here. It's safer where y'all at. #DetroitVsEverybody}
{My man Danny Brown KILLED it}
{Only eminem & trick trickdej loaf in nothing :)  Shady we love you}
{I have YET to see a valid argument on why eminems verse was trash. Just because he rapped too fast and complex for you dumb fucks doesn't mean anything, you're only hating oh him because he's white he raps so fast and complex you guys cant comprehend it}
{YOOOO! my nigga eminem kilt this shit! }
{eminem like a fucking fortune ille grated Although born to rap does not exist this white rapper that kills black}
{Honestly i am a Stan, but slow down and let us understand what the hell you are saying Marshall , lyrically this is good but delivery sucks ass}
{ fuck yes }
{love this :D}
{God damn everyone shut the hell up and watch the fucking video. A bunch of hating ass retards always flood these comments so I have to put a badass comment so it gets the most likes and ends up on the top so people know. Danny Brown cracks me the hell up.}
{Living in the the Detroit area, I gotta say, this shit's nice. By far one of Big Sean's best verses. Truly improved and has grown into dope emcee! REALLY REALLY don't wanna sound like an Eminem Stan but c'mon now, he did have the best verse.}
{nice Eminem you rock}
{313 stand up}
{BigSean>Danny Brown> Em> Royce for best lyrics on this song}
{Ройс как всегда на высоте!}
{this song is alright, thought I thought Big Sean's verse on was meh, he ended well, but nothing else stood out for me, his flow improved in this song, but he lacked the conviction that everyone else had, Danny Brown was a typical Brown verse that lacked his usual aggression a little bit it weren't anything special, maybe cus it was too short compared to the others, which is a shame cus I love Danny Brown, verse was still decent though,  and I did not like Dej Loaf on the chorus one bit, her singing voice sounds really off to me, not so nice, but Royce Da 5"9 and Eminem killed their verses, and those 2 starting and ending the songs made it good for me !!!}
{Big seans whole career is depressing and so is his flow and hes not even from Detroit hes from Pontiac lol he just drives over to the D and claims it}
{Why do eminem fans call themselves 'stans'? Stan died at the end of the song because of his obsession with eminem. I don't think its a good thing to be called a 'stan' then....}
{Everyone went hard damn.. and for those people who only skipped to Eminems part I feel kinda bad for you cause y'all are missing out on hip hop but Eminem freaking killed it }

{44 to you Marshall.... B,,B,,B,,RABBIT.   Rap gun}
{On This song  1-ROYCE DA  5'9 = Flow was sick and His verse was epic .. his rhymes were a bit meh at some points but He Was The Best On This Track 2- EMINEM = Royce's only real competition on this track is Marshall , His flow was a bit off but his rhymes were on point , Plus I kinda like his new style .  3-BIG SEAN= Both his flow and rhymes were good but I just didn't feel it for some reason.  But he just wasn't energetic enough  4-DANNY BROWN = His style is unique but his seems to have a hard time annunciating his verse .. Plus he bends words to the point where it doesn't even make sense  Total rating for the track = A-}

{Заябись!!Долго ждал этого!!}
{I knew ppl would hate on Em in the comments smh. I love this ssssong}
{Best verse goes to Sean.}
{Trick Trick had the best verse}
{"honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets" dope}
{Eminem is the Best forever <3}
{This song is awesome !!  Em's verse and Royce are the best !!}
{You can have a good verse base don the flow and a good verse based on the lyrics! Big Sean had the best flow verse and Royce has the best lyrical verse! Im a Em fan but not because he's saying 30 words per second and using sophisticated words makes him the best rapper}
{Who is the little kid singing the hook?}
{Damn big sean killed it}
{Royce is fucking insane brooooooo}
{Hope to see a little bit more of Detroit on this video. Very good song I think, long verses and all do something interesting.}
{Eminem long said that he sold his soul to the devil so my assessment 2}
{I'm personally A huge Eminem fan. Been a fan since MMLP , I was 10 back then. Now I'm 24. NEver stop listening to this cat.BUT, Danny in my opinion is the best one in this track :) Even tho it was actually ROYCE who had the best verse. The scale of the best rapper who killed this track goes like this : 1.ROYCE 2. SEAN 3.DANNY 4. EM Em might have the sickest bars, but the flow kind-a fucked it up for me. I'm too patient. This flow he has right now is ok FOR RAP GOD. Don't use the same chopper flow on every song man, goddamn.}
{Взрослый рэп...о Эм ты шикарен }
{Eminem is not even that good in this song what all u folks talking about ...}
{This is perfect}

{Holy “Fack" that was amazing! #ŠTÅŃFØRŁĮFË}
{#١ eminem  king rab}
{Let's not forget the fact that trick trick did absolutely nothing}
{Hearing an eminem verse now n days is a bore I seriously yawn when I hear this overrated dude, not saying he isn't good, above average yes but not the best he barely makes my top 20 when making a music list.}
{Music started at 3:40}
{please make a music video for the remix }
{The king is back!}
{so so wonderfull . can't be thought of  without Eminem!!}
{Good shit}
{Just amazing!}

{Eminem is the best rapper........i love this song and the video is great sooo shut up u haters and if u don't Like it then dont watch it u idiots}
{Big Sean had the Best verse imo. JS}
{eminem rozjebał}
{With whole respect to Eminem, but his styles is starting to bore a little, need more variety.}
{Next up...  "Detroit Vs. Everybody" Official Remix video?}
{Love ittt}
{Fucking good song, god song}
{This is so insane!!!! Reminds me of the 99 problems video}
{This song is dope as fuck. Everybody killed that shit badly}
{Rispetto assoluto for Detroit ❤️}
{He should change the beats in his songs rn,miss the old slim shady.His beats rn are rock kinda and that sucks}
{О Бож,как круто *0*}
{I didn't understand a damn thing Danny said.}
{awesome song but I feel like it needs D12 on it}
{Em killed it as usual}
{KING}
{While eminem is one of the best rappers ever, Royce BODIED him on this beat}
{Danny Brown looks like a crack head, he raps like one too. }
{Brasil aqui !!}
{I don't like Big Sean but i'm impressed with this verse}
{LMAOOOO! So many comments about Eminem "Stans" (fans) and how they "ride his dick" even though there are no comments praising Eminem and riding his dick. So stupid...}
{Eminem raw and shit but yall em fans are some major dickriders lol}
{KOSOVA FOREVER}

{hell yeah}
{No bias, Big Sean had the best verse}
{Eminem is my favourite rapper, but I think Big Sean had the best verse on this one. But hey, that's just my opinion.}
{Like this comment for no reason}
{Being a stan doesn't mean i only listen to eminem and it doesn't mean that we say that eminem is the only rapper in the world -_- , grow up ! He had the best verse in this song  though <3 and he is the best rapper alive .  Ps: stans do admit that eminem makes some mistakes :D no one is perfect and it's normal to make some mistakes , but Eminem almost has no mistakes in rap}
{Eminem the shit period!🙌💯 I'm from the "D"!!!}
{I have to say... Big Sean killed that shit, redrum !!!}
{Too much hate on comments.If you don't like this song just don't listen it :) Also, Nobody cares if you don't like Em really ;)}
{I like how everybody who hate eminem came here just to diss us. But in the words of eminem "I ain't gotta say a word i just flip 'em the bird and keep going we don't take shit from nobody"}
{Eminem for the end, it´s just amazing !!!!}
{Typical Stan: -Has a picture of Eminem or one of his album covers as their profile pic -Skips to Eminem's part on songs he's featured on -Says that he's the best rapper alive but doesn't even listen to other rappers -Says that he's the only rapper that raps about meaningful shit when in the past he rapped about rape, drugs and killing his mother -Makes up excuses when he has a shitty verse -Likes Eminem because he's white}
{this song is straight fire good job Eminem im looking forward to the verses hes gunna spit with the legendary tech n9ne and LL cool j}
{eminem is the best rapper alive}
{301 просмотр. Фу, накрутка}
{Я не знаю почему,  но меня пиздец бесит баба в припеве}
{Dope Shit!!!!}
{THIS WHAT I'M TALKING BOUT!}
{YES!}
{feel like Eminem is rapping for others rappers now, is faster than ever, but it doesn't sound good like he used to. He's showing his talents, not making good music}
{power!!!}
{This...was...AMAZING!!! Total Detroit all star lineup here; WOW!}
{***** Eminemmmmmmmm <3}
{For three whole seconds I almost wished I was from Detroit. Job well done.}
{This is so fucking cool *_*  but still dont know what is the worst Detroit or baghdad???}
{OVERRATED}
{AWESOME !}
{Ficou tooop o clip.}
{damn danny brown killed it}
{I mean obviously Eminem does either amazing or at the least better then average on every song, you can't shit on him.  Peoples careers and styles always change through time like any great respected artist.  I'm not gonna lie i really fucked with Big Seans verse tho (yes obviously Danny Brown and Royce had nice verses)}
{Look guys this is just my humble opinion. I am not going to lie There are alot of rappers who are really really good but for me Eminem is the G.O.A.T. Get real guys i saw a comment that said Drake is better than Eminem! Jesus!}
{Good god, i forgot how much of a cess pool the youtube comments are. Out.}
{3,160th!}
{What i learnt: If u wanna come out on top make ur verse special..even though if it takes you to rap like a chimpanzee! 2;56}
{big Sean's verse is sick}
{Как просто трек для альбома - Всё заебись! Подача флоу и всё такое! Эт всё чётко! Все пацаны збс зачитали! Но давайте по сути! Detroit vs Everybody - То есть - С этим треком они выходят в свет и как бы говорят - Ребята мы Детройт и мы против всех! С таким треком = Провал! Честно! Припев слабый, минус не могу понять почему именно он! Пацаны читают так как будто немного устали от жизни! Ребят ну это не серьёзно! Для "Такого" трека всё должно выглядеть и слышаться мощно чтоб смело можно было говорить - Да мы Detroit и всем вам пиздец! А так ребят ну 50\50! Возьмём Em'а - Флоу голос темп и текст в треке "например" Guts Over Fear и здесь! }
{DETROIT FINEST QUALITY!}
{So cool!}
{Just putting my 2 cents in but I used to be a huge Eminem fan and I still think he is the best of all time overall but he just isn't what he used to be.  His flow and lyrics are very good but its almost like he removed all emotion from his delivery and just relies on the skill of rhyming as many words in a sentence as possible.  Which may be impressive its 1 dimensional and gets a little stale.  He used to rhyme with such raw emotion and skill it was incredible but he is older now and probably dosent have the same me against the world mentality which made him so great.  Now I listen to a lot of J. Cole, Lupe, Ab-Soul and Kanye. }
{Eminem will be 100 years old and still be killin' it!}
{Im an eminem fan, but his verse was weak on this. Big Sean and Royce da 5'9 had better verses. Danny Brown was ok. Anyone who thinks Big Sean and Royce didnt kill this doesnt know shit about hip hop}
{Raw asf}
{My top list :  1° Eminem Rest i don't care..}
{Royce though.....damn}
{i havent seent his yet i bet ems wearing a hat with a hoodie over it}
{welcom back Hip Hop <3 }
{I love this song but this video is boring as fuck...}
{Wow ems flow is shitty lol}
{Big Sean fuckin' killed this song tho.}
{I used to rap like Eminem, or so I thought.  I gave it up because my youtube was getting shit on, and i'm white, so there is that. }
{theres two things missing in this song..  J Dilla on the beat and Proof}
{Royce and Sean had the best verses! Eminem delivery was dope but he said some weird stuff }
{In my opinion, if they left out Big Sean It would be a better song....he doesn't come in as hard as the rest of them, and it kinda just takes away the energy of the song.}
{Racism is played the fuck out. White people this, black people that, grow the fuck up we are all the damn same get the fuck over it. There are black doctors & white gangsters. Black country singers & white rappers. Yall make the human race look pathetic.}
{3:39 you're welcome. }
{Shoulda seen my face when I saw Denaun Porter}
{Very good soongs beautiful}
{Em killed it}
{Badass!!!}
{spit dat fire boiii}
{Quien es el que canta antes de Eminem}
{This song makes me so proud being and living in Detroit ♥ }
{Big sean isnt even from detroit}
{чёт шлак}
{danny brown gets paid to literally not say any words and just make sounds}
{This is too nice}
{Every single rapper here did beautiful! But to be honest, the dude with glasses (The one before the second verse of the girl) He didn't start that amazingly but still a very good start.}
{Marshall 😍❤️}
{if you rappin with Em, step yo game up. Big Sean did his thing}
{заебись, посоны, а обама хуесас}
{Where's noah and kane lol anyways peace on the streets SAANN}
{Eminem isn't actually from Detroit  He is from my hometown St Joseph}
{301 oh ye}
{Like if you are watching in 2015 hhhhhhh}
{eLZhi should've been on this record. Royce is Royce. Big Sean snapped. Em was hard to hear at times. Danny could've done better. Not a fan of Dej Lof. Go find Invincible, if you want a female from Detroit to represent on the mic. Btw, am I the only one that thinks Em had no choice but to give Trick that instrumental for "the others" remix? haha cuz it already happened. I guess Trick is the Suge Knight of Detroit, with his "No Fly Zone", keeping Rick Ross from performing there....}
{So Trick Trick was just here to flash the 666 sign, great.}
{No Obie Trice :-(}
{Each one had different flavor so yeah it was fire raw I love my city downtown Detroit yesss}
{Danny brown takes time to grow on you. I thought he was whack when i first heard him on that xxl cypher but after listening to XXX and old hes def one of the realest out today no doubt}
{SHADY for ever!!!}
{Big Sean murdered this shit.}
{Boom. }
{The vocal production was a little weak and the entire song was sloppy plus this was not a great choice for the instrumental. On the other hand this is actually genius. With Dej Loafs up and coming popularity, danny Browns growing underground fame, royces skill, and sean & ems mainstream appeal I feel like this helps detroit a little when it comes to the hip hop sene.}
{THE BEST VIDEO ON THE CHANNEL!!!! EMINEM RULZ!!!}
{Jesus whats wrong with eminem? TOday Music is shit...}
{People usually hate on Big Sean and I have to admit I didn't like his rap in Open Wide but his flow was dope in this song.}
{there are no words to describe Eminem.... he is the RAP GOD}
{No entendí una mierda, pero el ritmo está chido :P}
{I love this song. Like eminem  concert in spain (madrid)}
{Where they at doe? LA vs Everybody? DISAPPOINTED.}
{Wow 301 views i got in early yuss}
{Guys... Eminem is washed up... he is very technically good, but his content is dead. Same shit different song. He will never be back to his glory days,  he has changed.}
{jajajajja a la ´pu8tn AS´SÑ´ CSDÑVCSXZCVSVDXC}
{At first I thought that this song ain't gonna be good bcuz there are Like 6 rappers but then I heard the song and now I'm like Holy Shemurr☺}
{Freshhh}
{Красавец Эм!!!}
{Dope to see danny on a track with em}
{just mastery B|}
{If Biggie, Nas, N.W.A. were still alive, they would have the same hate LiL Wayne, Eminem, Nas, and Jay-Z get. :/ Let old school be old school and new school be new school.}
{1}
{They forgot the Clear Soul Force crew..... Would've been that much better.}
{FINALLY!!}
{Can't wait for the remix to come out!!!}
{Damn, not a huge fan of Big Sean but he killed this!}
{Where can I find its LYRICS ?!}
{wooooooooooooolllllllllllll}
{Big Sean had a good verse, but I think people are calling it the best because it's easiest to pick up on his lyrical ability from it. Royce had the best verse here for me, closely followed by Em. A lot of the genius in their lyrics go over most peoples heads.}
{EMINEMM <333}
{lol what is the line danny brown says before, 'like to fat bitches scissoring'?}
{Esto representa hasta mi zona Valencia España y a todo el mundo entero inigualables...  One Love para esto}
{cool music}
{Eminem is G.O.A.T ...End of story!}
{This collab is pretty nice, I guess, but the one collaboration I wanna hear is the rumored L.A. vs. Everybody. That's shit's gon' be fire! Hahaha!}
{All these fucking racists and trolls in the comments....jesus. The "best rapper of all time" argument is always a circle jerk, just shut up and enjoy the track.}
{Eminem kill it}
{путин хуйло.}
{Big Sean murdered everybody.}
{Love it}
{Look at all the Eminem haters in the comments mad cause he can spit better than they're favorite rapper lol}
{Omg this is soo amazing 😊😊😊}
{I don't listen to any other rap but Eminem that obviously mean's he is the best in the world. I'm being sarcastic for you slow people.}
{I keep seeing comments on Eminem videos talking about "Stans" and Eminem fans. But for some reason I hardly see Eminem fans on his videos. What I do see, however, is all the people hating Eminem fans. If you do not like Eminem fans then stop watching his videos and reading the comment section. Also, stop trying to draw attention to yourself by talking about the same "I hate Eminem stan's blah blah blah..." that you find on every video with either a white rapper or Eminem. Get over yourself and just enjoy the music.}
{Trick Tricks part was so pointless.}
{The chorus kinda sounds like a kid I know. But its fitting.}
{Clear Soul Forces needa hop on this. }
{Royce is trash, half the shit he spits makes no sense. }
{so the best rapper in da world is white }
{Eminem sucks}
{ge.e.e.e.e.e.e.e.e.e.e.e.e.e.e.e.e.e.e.e.e.e.e..e.e.e.e.e.e.e..e.e.e.e..e.e.e.e.e.e.e..e.eniaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaal}
{Ok, is the third guy literally Jordan Peele making a joke? I'm sorry, but he's fucking terrible}
{Im not a hater (im a big fan of eminem) but I think eminem's part is like edited}
{Some people say that girls can't rap but look at DJ Loaf she is killing it so all the GUYS that say girls/Women can't rap shut up cuz u don't know s***}
{Eminem is the best no matter what. EMINEM FOREVER!!!!!}
{Am I the only one who skips to Eminem's part?}
{RESPECT!!}
{Клип понравился!!! Круто сделано! Кто русский, отпишитесь)}
{Detroit vs everybody......﻿}
{so great !!!! keep up the awesome work}
{R.I.P. Proof}
{I like the lyrics he uses.}
{Em killed it with his verse}
{Cool!}
{"They don't call him slim shady for nothing}
{Big Sean is the reallest}
{Royce has best verse !}
{Shady recordzzzzz...7th street..}
{Lol the comment sections on these type of videos are cancerous I swear...}
{That Def loaf chorus, simple but catching...}
{...the current Detroit fuck up, the future fuck up of the USA...}
{Русские, вы где? :)))))}
{<3}
{Love the song Eminem was ripping that shit}
{4:37 I like how they show hot dogs after he says "penises" nice touch.}
{Stop ridin EM's Dick!!!! verse not that great.}
{Dafaq did danny brown say. People tryna say he got the best verse but I'm still yet to decipher it.}
{Big Sean shit was to dopest... em is doing to much... take it easy em..,. it didnt fit to me peridod.... and yeah im a fan of Eminem.}
{"eminem is the greatest rapper of all time. he raps about real shit unlike every black rapper that just talks about money drugs and women. macklemore iggy azalea and g-eazy are good too." - white people that know nothing about rap and are lowkey racist}
{I personally think Royce and Sean had more clever verses, but I can't help but enjoy Em's emotion in the way he spits.}
{Happy Birthday ***** ! #ThisBeatIsHipHop Salute EminemVEVO Dope Of You . Salute, Sir}
{FUCK DEJ LOAF AND BIG SEAN! THEY RUINED THIS SONG!}
{You all need to stop arguing about who's the best here. It's an OPINION, not a fact. I personally think that Eminem is the best here but who cares if someone things someone else is. Chilllllllllllll xD Rant over.}
{Em's verse was fire as always}
{This is only good cause eminem is in it. Everyone else is a nobody or a has been}
{Лучший белый репер}
{i aint fucked with eminem since like 2006 bro all his new shit corny as hell}
{big sean been killing features lately}
{Brazil best song of the year}
{damn}
{IMO, Eminem surprisingly didn't have the strongest verse. And I'm a big  Em fan. He's in my Top 5 DOA. But he fell off a bit. Ima have to give it to Big Sean and Danny Brown for coming out the strongest on this track.}
{Ems verse on this is not as great as it is hyped to be.  I think Seans verse is the best and that Danny Browns verse has good lyricism but his voice annoying as fuck}
{If Seth Rogen and the Weeknd had a kid, it would be Danny Brown.}
{Eminem Deus Do Rap .. }
{☺😊☺😊☺😊☺💜💜😘}
{Danny brown is so wack}
{Eminem, best rapper ever :-)}
{Eminem, Royce da 5'9", Big Sean, Danny Brown, Dej Loaf, Trick Trick  . The Bests , Eminem Forever .. Big Detroit .. }

{OXXXYMIRON! PS. Американцы лохи}

{This song is amazing, great job to everyone!}
{Tbh big Sean was amazing but I am a Stan and idk what it is but when I hear eminem come in my ears perk up and I start paying attention more Bc Ik something is gonna happen. I love me and his music}
{At this point its now getting annoying with all the people saying that the Eminem dick riders are annoying... Both sides, stfu and listen to the damn song if you want. ALL the rappers on this track would be disappointed in the cunts that care more about making a point in the comments then listening to the song and sharing it with friends. smh}
{Didn't Sean diss Danny brown awhile back?}

{Evrybody who doesn't like detriot can jump in a hole☺️}

{#HeLikeABOSS}
{eminem is dead}
{It's been about three months since this song was originally released and it's still hard for me to decide who here had the best verse, I mean they all went hard on this. This is easily one of my favorite tracks of ShadyXV; Vegas and Psychopath Killer are my other two favorite tracks on ShadyXV. All of the tracks on ShadyXV were amazing but those three are easily my favorite. (Edit: Grammar error)}
{boom!!!}
{fire i say}
{Em's verse is awesome!}
{Royce da 5'9" is one of the best}
{Dude on the left at 1:00-1:01 is the person who started his clothing line Detroit vs Everybody. Long before Big Sean dropped it in Control. Went from a tiny store to now Em making a song inspired by it.}

{RAPGOD}
{Fuck these comments}
{Royce killed it the most. Eminem didn't even phase me.}
{The fact that eminem is white, has nothing do with the fact that he is one of the best rappers who ever lived. When I first heard a song of his I didn't think white or black. I just listened to the song. If the color of the artist is a problem, trust me your the problem! Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I'm going listen to what I want to listen regardless of what anyone thinks. Em's verse was not the weakest you should listen again.}
{Eminem eu te amo ❤❤❤❤}
{Perfect.!}
{Nice!!!}
{Eminem shouldn't try to rap fast and just rap a bit slower like he used to do}
{Royce killed it Big Sean went in hard And em went in hard and killed it I would say Danny Brown killed it or whatever but I couldn't understand what he was saying}
{Claramente son de los mejores aunque la gente solo lo mire a Eminem los aristas que lo rodean los pueden llegar a mejorar.}

{Some high next level shit, Em and Big Sean killed it !}
{Why is everyone saying Em? To lazy to type Eminem or wat?}
{OldSchool Eminem.}
{This song should be done by Bad Meets Evil. Both, Royce and Eminem has amazing flow and lyrics. And it's joy to listen them. Instrumental great as well. But other rappers turned this song into crap. And it's really disappointing.}

{Danny brown look like and sound like a crazy homeless dude}
{Guys face it, Eminem is never going to be like he used to. This verse is a prime example what's wrong with Eminem today. His flow is makes it unlistenable to what he is saying and his lyrics are trash. Sorry but Drake >>>>>>>>>> Eminem.}
{Is Proof? 5:48}
{I still can't believe Elzhi ain't on this. How you gonna make a song called Detroit Vs. Everybody and not have the illest emcee from Detroit on it?}

{Eminem have the most annoying stans ever, I mean Eminem is 1 of my favorite rappers, but I don't go around with his dick in my mouth claiming how how hes the best rapper ever, eminem stans never want to admit when Eminem spits a bad verse or make a horrible song, they'll just come up with some excuse of like "did you not hear his flow, or his lyrical structure?"  While Eminem may not be the most mainstream ever, he sure do uses a lot of shitty POP beats these days. His verse was fucking horrible in this song, maybe he did spit something lyrical but still was horrible..I don't even think it went well with the song flow. Eminem can make a song rapping about bullshit and his fucking stans will still fucking defend the song. Most of all, most of his fucking stans only like him because he's fucking white and that's a fact. How come he's the first rapper to win an Oscar? Simple, because he's white, I can name several POSITIVE songs just as Lose Yourself and the artists never won not even a grammy.﻿}

{Royce is sick}
{Это ахуенно }
{1) Royce Da 5'9: The most balanced verse, of all the rappers here. 2) Eminem (technically brilliant, but a verbal overload doesn't make a best verse) 3) Big Sean: First half of verse was wack then he caught up at the end-too late. 4) Danny Brown: I need a translator (rap genius required) 5) Dej: I still wanna hit it though-Try Me.}

{Of course Em had to go last}
{OPINIONS OK SHIT}
{dope}
{Dis kingblazze on ig yo dis real hip-hop wish miss loaf had a verse she wud of blazed it}
{Be real, Danny Brown killed it, Big Sean normally has weak verses but this one was surprisingly good, and Eminem's flow is weak and doesn't fit the beat. Who cares how many internal rhymes he squishes into his verse if it sounds like shit?}

{If Eminem go's to hard on a track when he's featuring  others they cant keep up with him, he's done it time and time again so if it's not what you expected then that means he had to step back so that the rest can shine cause. I know just like everyone else knows what he really wrote would have killed everybody else so he had to fall back so he's team he's city can shine.}

{*It's actually pretty lame. Uncreative. Has no meaning. No purpose. Just a bunch of random shots all filmed separately. Remember the days when all the rappers were actually in the same shot? And not all filmed separately all on different days. Remember when music videos had treatments? This video literally has no substance whatsoever. Makes Detroit look like a pile of shit that I'd never want to visit. All dark, dirty and dingy with homeless drug addicts on the street. If you were trying to make Detroit look like a pile of shit you succeeded. It's the only concept Eminem has now. He lives up in a huge house in a private area but comes to the slums to film things in abandoned location then heads back to his life of luxury.* *This video looks like it was shot on a shoes string budget. It's literally, "stand here, in this abandon location, while I point a camera at you." There's nothing to it. I could make this video. This has the same production value as the cypher you just put out. Has the exact same concept as well. "Stand here while I film you and we'll cut it all together. It fucking sucks! Seriously. This video is horrible. Shot with a digital still shot camera that has a video setting. I fucking hate these people making videos with these commercially sold cameras that anyone and their mother can buy. Remember the cameras they use to shoot videos with? You the average person couldn't afford it, and they didn't sell them in Buy Best. It's what separated the professorial film makers from the amateur. Now that line is blurred and everything looks amateur because it's just a bunch of amateurs who think they're professional. Everyone and their mother can buy a camera and edit a video on a computer. Now even big names in the business hire these amateurs directors who edit their videos on a home computer. What the fuck is that? Hype Williams never shot a video on a fuckin digital camera and then edited it on a fuckin laptop.* *Music videos use to be a big industry with big companies and creative concepts and creative directors. Now it's reduced to nothing but student films. Now all you have to do to became a director is go to Best Buy and get a camera and a laptop, and now you're a music video director. It's one thing when amateur rappers do it, you expect their video to be amateur, but when one of the biggest names in rap starts doing it, that's when you know shit is finally over!*}

{Eh. Eminem is a lyrical genius but I'm not feeling this song. As well as most of Shady XV. Some of the shit he produces is fire though. Maybe he should stick to producing and mentoring up and coming artists.}
{Eminem and all his team!!! I think that you should carry out charity or even more, to pass in a city administration of Detroit! Difficult work, but I think quite justified, especially the people will support you. At all this, many remember Arnold Schwarzenegger's arrival to a position of the governor of California. I think it is worth carrying out the same course to Eminem because years pass, he will grow old and I don't think that he can sing further, in the best for a case to be a producer. So Marshall Metters, make for this city better, HEAD it!!!}
{1. Big Sean 2. Royce 3. Danny 4. Eminem Damn Eminem fell off so hard. His flow sounds so forced. Glad his verse came on last so I know when to skip to the next song. And if you're a backpacker, don't reply. (i.e. you've never heard anyone besides Eminem)}

{Eminem wou. ... ♥}
{eminem come to boston}
{EMINEM is a fucking boss}
{Danny had the best verse I think, I respect that maybe his voice can annoy people but personally I think that's what makes him good because it's original, to me Eminems whole style and image is pretty stale now and he needs to kind of go away...}
{I don't know anyone except Em..}

{Eminem Albaniaa <3 }
{Eminem Is the best <3 <3 <3}
{This music video is SICK! The song is dope and the video has a really old school feel to it! Everyone did great on this song and Eminem Killed it with those insane rhymes , Flow and all that! How he transitions with the same rhyme scheme with two different sets of multis , and changes them up throughout the verse. IMO this is one of the greatest and one of the most complex Em verses Of all time. I even broke down his verse to show how genius it is.}
{Big Sean had the best verse..}
{This shit was dope}
{1.Danny Brown  2.Eminem 3.Royce 4. Big Sean}
{I didnt understand a single word that Danny Brown said}
{First view :p}

{Come To TURKEY and show who is real RAPPER!  our rappers is so weird they making ass hair style pls come here Eminem plsss we need you}
{Great song. Everyone have dope lyrics. Danny Brown has a weird voice, but when you get used to it he's good. He looks like he stepped straight out of 90's in this video, but still... I think Royce and Em have the best verses.﻿}
{#Respec  From Algeria <3}
{Eminem > Big Sean > Danny Brown > Nickel da Nine but that Obie Trice Walking Dead remix dookies on it all Everyone killed it... damn if there's a part 2 to this oh lord}

{Em is the best rapper. Y'all haters will laugh at me when I say this but when he is gone,you will Realize how bad mainstream music has become. Em is a true wordsmith,he has had several different rapping styles over the past 15+ years and he has mastered them all,and to all of you complaining about his new style,just be thankful that he is still here...}

{Eminem the best rap, #cometobrazileminem}
{Big Sean must be crying since he's so offended because hardly anybody wants to rewind his part. Also that guy before em had one of the most annoying voices, it made it hard to listen to his lyrics, but when I did they were simple and trite.  Royce and em were good though. I agree with whoever said Vegas would be a more entertaining music video.}
{Big Sean was good}
{u r the greatest Em'}

{niiiiiiiceeeeeeeeeee}
{Eminem you're the best fucking rapper of all time!}
{what the fuck happend to eminem he just shows of that he can spit quick which makes his flow wack as fuck, couse he stops in the middle of a line becouse he spit it to quick and he waits for another i cant fucking listen to that sounds like shit. Other rapers did well}

{Есть есть!}

{Eminem ofc boss !!!}
{Detroit vs everybody!}
{all of you fuck off he is awsome and you all want to just like him calm the fuck down and leave him alone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!}

{idk about that girls vocals. raps were all good tho.}
{Danny > Sean }
{Эм найкрутейший!!!}
{Why is there so much hate these days? Can't we just focus on the music, and not on the rappers or on their backgrounds. Music is about lyrics, flow, beats, rhythm. Not about how certain people look like. It's really annoying to read comments judging them, I bet you couldn't do any better. Remember the meaning of REAL music.}

{This song is a great tribute to Hip Hop industry, now rappers have to be careful when Detroit name comes on public, this song is my favorite from ShadyXY, and the history of Hip Hop will be way more brutal if Eminem makes it real and master Teck N9ne new song "Worldwide Choppers 2"}

{Em nailed it, as usual ,the incredible Marshall..}
{Enimen is much better..}
{The problem is with ya'll is that you came here to discuss art and music, you debate on whos better. You guys are not getting the message they're trying to deliver. Detroit is a tough city to live in, it is bankrupt, abandoned. Try to get the message and understand they sing about themselves struggling in a tough place which needs help. }
{The odds vs the world !!!}

{What ever comes... Eminem is still the best motherf***ing rapper!}
{yeah ok}
{hell yeah}
{Eminem killed it !!!}
{By far one of the best collabs in history 👌}

{Eminem Please Come To Morocco  #Morocco_After_Russia  }
{Royce and Em (y) Daaamn and I still don't know why People critisize Em Wtf the guy is a legand :3 !! well haters gone hate ain't they :p}
{i love eminem saludos desde Mexico}
{this whole track is just amazing ,i was 10 years old when i started to be a fan of EM and now im 17 and still a huge fan of EM , and one of my dreams is to go to detroit and meet him }
{DETROIT VERSUS EVERYBODYYY}
{Em went the hardest, but Sean's metaphors and lyrics were on point.}
{Amazing piece of work! Hands down!}
{i don´t know why, but i just didn´t like royce´s, big sean´s nor brown´s flows. and eminem is not screaming here, so my ears can rest a bit.}
{This is so long overdue}
{See a few people hating on Danny here, now I'm not trying to say I'm right you're wrong, but I feel the reasons are all wrong and they don't know Danny at all. First off, if you dislike him fine, but to say he's awful and whatever is ridiculous. You're judging him because of his unique voice, you don't realise his flow, his lyrics etc. This dude got one of the most critically acclaimed albums of last year and is well respected by many of rap's current top guys. He's different sure, he may not be everyone's cup of tea, but the Danny is fucking one of the most talented rappers out there at the moment.}
{I think they gave Big Sean too much time on the song that could've been spread out better. Sean,s not exactly the best rapper on the track.}
{Приезжай в Россию Eminem!Русские поддержите лайком ! Может он это увидит )}
{ , from morocco to detroitt Big Up  ...}

{cool}
{ЗАЕБИСЬ!}
{Eminem come in Italy!!!}
{Trop bien la musique juste enorme le son}
{I don't think anybody could lyrically fuck with Em right now}
{Dude big sean went off period}
{Big Sean should start writing lyrics like this for his actual albums/singles, that would be *sick*}
{i have waited soooooooooooooooooo long for this music video. AND NOW IT'S FINALLY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!}

{Eminem killlllllleddddd it thoooo ! 💜💜💜💜💜}
{best song ever!}
{Shady XV wasnt an album I was able to listen to over and over like previous Eminem albums but I did like the variety of artists on the album. Lets hope Em goes back to his original style like MMLP or SSLP. Those were absolutely great albums and he always had a story to tell but now its not the same.}
{Eminem is a trend setter. Real Talk. He just fired all other rappers to shoot up their tracks on the theme.}
{lol}

{Ахиренчик как всегда супер балдел балдел балдел}
{301 wievs ? EMINEM, have you just broke the wievs of youtube?}
