I was mad and I thought to myself, why not let\u0027s just take it slowly and do my homework at an average pace. However in 6th grade, my bullies told the teacher again how I always turn my homework late and the teacher kinda made fun of me for that. I got so mad that for the entire year, I\u0027m the first student to turn in homework and got good grades in exams. It was epic.",

Faça-os receber tudo de volta Não me diga que você acredita nisso Você só vai levar isso ou você vai contra atacar? ----------- Você não vai conseguir Você nunca vai quebrar isso Você nunca poderia superá-los, cara eles são melhores do que pode enfrentar Pensando que eles dão a mínima o seu pensamento diferente Não, eles dão a mínima você entende o que estou dizendo? Eu não estou brincando Eu vou dar a você homem hetero Há muitos outros e você não é tão grande cara Pare o que você está dizendo Pare o que você está fazendo Todo mundo aqui sabe que você está apenas fingindo Naa eu não quero mais ouvir Eu não quero mais ouvir isso Todos esses pensamentos eles não são o que eu preciso mais Eu estou prestes a fechar a porra da porta Em todos os seus pobres aborrecedores com suas cabeças nas nuvens Falando alto e em bom som tão orgulhosos É melhor vocês calarem as suas malditas bocas Antes que eu faça mais do que falar Está prestes a desaparecer",

  "Letra da música em português: Você nunca vai conseguir Você não é bom o suficiente Há um milhão de outras pessoas com a mesma habilidade Você realmente acha que é diferente Cara, você deve estar brincando Acha que você vai acertar Mas você simplesmente não entende É impossível Não é provável Seu irresponsável Muitos obstáculos Você tem que pará-lo yo Você tem que ir devagar Você não pode ser um profissional Não perca seu tempo, não mais Quem diabos é você Para me dizer o que fazer Eu não dou a mínima se você disser que desaprova Vou fazer minha jogada Eu vou fazer isso em breve E eu vou fazer isso porque é o que eu quero fazer Porque todas essas opiniões E todas essas posições Elas vêm em milhões Elas estão bloqueando sua visão Mas não, você não pode ouvir Essa merda é toda ficção Porque você segura o poder enquanto seu -------- Você nunca vai conseguir Não tem como você fazer isso Sim, talvez você possa fingir Mas você nunca vai conseguir Você vai apenas aceitar isso? Faça-os receber tudo de volta Não me diga que você acredita nisso Você só vai levar isso ou você vai contra atacar? ----------- Você não vai conseguir Você nunca vai quebrar isso Você nunca poderia superá-los, cara eles são melhores do que pode enfrentar Pensando que eles dão a mínima o seu pensamento diferente Não, eles dão a mínima você entende o que estou dizendo? Eu não estou brincando Eu vou dar a você homem hetero Há muitos outros e você não é tão grande cara Pare o que você está dizendo Pare o que você está fazendo Todo mundo aqui sabe que você está apenas fingindo Naa eu não quero mais ouvir Eu não quero mais ouvir isso Todos esses pensamentos eles não são o que eu preciso mais Eu estou prestes a fechar a porra da porta Em todos os seus pobres aborrecedores com suas cabeças nas nuvens Falando alto e em bom som tão orgulhosos É melhor vocês calarem as suas malditas bocas Antes que eu faça mais do que falar Está prestes a desaparecer",

  "This song means so much to me. Here\u0027s the Story why even though no one is gonna read it after 5 years probably.😂 Some background Information about me. I\u0027m German, 14 years old and I\u0027ve known him since Collapse, so the 8th of March 2023. The Summer break in Germany ended a couple months ago. In Germany, there are many different types of schools. And when 5th grade starts, it\u0027s possible to choose between many different types. I\u0027m in the so-called \"Oberschule\" which basically translates to high school.  Now it gets interesting: I have a bet with another person that\u0027s on a \"Gymnasium\" which also translates to high school but you have to do more on a \"Gymnasium\" then on an \"Oberschule\". Now it gets interesting: The other person I have the bet with is now in 9th grade and her grades are not from this world. In Germany, the grades go from 1 (Neffex aka the best) up to 6 (the absolute worst). On her last Certificate with all the grades she had 8 of these 1s and 6 times one grade below that so a 2. That means she had the best grade possible more often than any other grade. And like I said, I have a bet with her. We\u0027re comparing every exam and also the 2 Certificates we\u0027re gonna get in this school year and seeing who has the better grades. The one with the better grades wins. And now all the other people suddenly want to talk to me again saying something like: \"bro, you had only 2 of these 1s and you want to go up against someone with 8 of these?\" \"Bro, you\u0027re ruining your free time\" \"Don\u0027t you think that\u0027s a bit too much?\" \"Don\u0027t you think she\u0027s too good for you to beat her?\" And soooo much more.  And now, it\u0027s my time to Fight Back. I\u0027m gonna edit this Comment after every Exam and every certificate to let y\u0027all know who\u0027s winning.  And lastly to everyone somehow seeing this comment and thinking of something that they\u0027re doubting to reach or to achieve, this is for you: Hey, I know that you\u0027re doubting yourself just as so many other people do. And that\u0027s alright. Things feel scary when you first see them. And I\u0027ve been to that place as well. Do you remember the Covid Pandemic? In these 2 years, my self-confidence didn\u0027t exist anymore. I was doubting that I can live another day, that I can stand up, that I can go another step, that I can go another day telling everyone that I\u0027m fine and I\u0027m alright. But after these 2 years I got out of it and I\u0027m motivated to do something every single day. Now I\u0027m not gonna tell you to do something different or try something new, not at all. You can live your life as you want, I have nothing to do with that. But please don\u0027t make the same mistake as I did and waste 2 years of your life with these doubts. Thank you and I hope you have a great day or night.❤",

  "перевод песни Neffex - Fight Back - перевод песни  Ты никогда не сможешь сделать это Ты недостаточно хорош Есть миллионы других людей с такими же навыками Ты действительно думаешь, что ты другой?! Парень, ты должно быть шутишь! Думаю, ты собираешься ударить Но ты просто не понимаешь... Это невозможно Это маловероятно Ты безответственный Слишком много препятствий Ты должен остановить это, эй Ты должен притормозить Ты не можешь быть профессионалом Не трать больше свое время Кто ты нахрен такой Чтобы говорить мне, что делать? Мне наплевать, если вы говорите, что не одобряете Я собираюсь начать действовать Я собираюсь сделать это очень скоро И я сделаю это потому, что это то, чего я хочу Потому что все эти мнения И все эти ситуации Они идут миллионами Они блокируют твоё виденье Но нет! Ты не должен слушать! Вся эта дрянь - всего лишь фикция! Потому что ты силён до тех пор, пока тобою движет Ты никогда этого не добьёшься Нет способа сделать это Да, ты можешь притвориться. Но ты никогда не сделаешь это. Ты собираешься просто принять это? Заставь их вернуть свои слова назад! Не говори мне, что ты веришь в их слова! Ты просто собираешься принять это? Или ты, блядь, будешь сопротивляться?! Ты не собираешься делать это. Ты никогда его не сломаешь. Ты никогда не сможешь победить их, да они лучшие! Они лучше и ты видишь это! Думаю, что им просто наплевать, парень. Нет, им наплевать, что ты понял, что я тебе сказал. Я, блядь, не шучу! Я говорю всё как есть, парень. Есть слишком много других, и ты среди них не самый великий. Прекращай говорить! Прекращай что-либо делать! Все здесь знают, что ты просто подделка. Не-а, я больше не хочу это слышать! Я больше не хочу это слышать! Все эти грёбанные мысли они не то, что мне нужно! Я закрыл эту грёбанную дверь! На всех вас, несчастные ненавистники витающие в облаках! Говорю, чтобы все слышали: \"Ты лучше закрой свой чертов рот Ведь я сделаю больше, чем обещал До того как исчезну\"",

  "URGENT MESSAGE  !!! We\u0027re all going to live in this world temporarily. That\u0027s why we should  Repent and Accept JESUS CHRIST as our Lord and Savior. Repent for all your sins. Believe what he did in the cross that he died for you to save you and in the third day he rose again. Live for him, with that you will be saved. 💗 Pray this prayer : Dear Lord JESUS, I know that I am a sinner and I ask for your forgiveness. I believe that you died for my sins on the cross and in the third day you rose again. I turn from my sins an invite you to come to my life. I accept you as my Lord and savior. Now, let your will be done in my life. Through faith I believe that my name is already in the book of life. AMEN. It is written in the bible in Romans 10:9❣ If you declare with your mouth, \"Jesus is Lord,\" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. In John 3: 16  For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. Also in Ephesians 2:8-9 ❣ For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God. Now if you do that you are already save. 😍❣ God has already forgiven you. You are now a new creation. The old has gone the new has come. ❣ You are saved by grace through faith in Lord JESUS. You should not remove your faith with God and just allow the holy spirit to work in you. All the days of your life. CONTINUE SEEKING GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, SOUL AND MIND. 💓 After salvation is to live in the ways of the Lord all the days of your life. Read the bible and be a part of a group/mass that truly seek JESUS CHRIST and worship him in spirit and truth.❣ God Bless everyone! 😍❣",

You really think you\u0027re different? Then you must be kidding.  Think you\u0027re gonna hit it, but you just don\u0027t get it.  It\u0027s impossible, it\u0027s not probable.  You\u0027re irresponsible. Too many obstacles.  You gotta stop it yo, you gotta take it slow.  You can\u0027t be a pro, don\u0027t waste your time no more.  Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do? I don\u0027t give a damn if you say you disapprove! I\u0027m gonna make my move, I\u0027m gonna make it soon.  And I\u0027ll do it \u0027cause it\u0027s what I want to fucking do.  \u0027Cause all these opinions and all these positions.  They coming in millions, they\u0027re blocking your vision.  But no, you can\u0027t listen, that shit is all fiction.  \u0027Cause you hold the power as long as you\u0027re driven.  You\u0027re never gonna make it.  There\u0027s no way that you make it.  Yeah maybe you can fake it.  But you\u0027re never gonna make it.  Are you just gonna take that? Make them take it all back.  Don\u0027t tell me you believe that.  Are you just gonna take that? Or will you fucking fight back? Or will you fucking fight back? Yeah,  You ain\u0027t gonna make it, you ain\u0027t never ever gonna break it.  You can never beat \u0027em man, they\u0027re better than you, face it.  Thinking that they give a damn, you\u0027re not thinking straight kid No, they don\u0027t give a damn, you got what I\u0027m saying? I\u0027m not fucking playing, I\u0027ll give it to you straight, man.  There\u0027s too many others and you\u0027re not that great, man.  Stop what you\u0027re saying, stop what you\u0027re making.  Everybody here knows that you\u0027re just faking.  Nah, I don\u0027t wanna hear it anymore I don\u0027t wanna hear it anymore.  All these fucking thoughts, they are not what I need anymore I\u0027m about to shut the motherfucking door.  On all you poor ass haters with your heads in the clouds.  Talking out loud so proud You better shut your goddamn mouths Before I do more than speak out, it\u0027s about to head south! You\u0027re never gonna make it There\u0027s no way that you make it Yeah maybe you can fake it But you\u0027re never gonna make it Are you just gonna take that? Make them take it all back Don\u0027t tell me you believe that Are you just gonna take that? Or will you fucking fight back? Or will you fucking fight back?",

  "What Neffex songs taught me: Fight Back: You\u0027ll never make it without hard work and perseverance. Things are gonna get better: Things get harder as you get older. Failure: Failure ain\u0027t an option, work hard, be that 1 in a million. Unstoppable: You are unstoppable, climb to the top. Soldier: Keep moving on, even if it\u0027s difficult. Never Give Up: You got this, never give up. Best Of Me: The mistakes you make, make you stronger. Destiny: Be the best, never listen to those haters. Greatest: Don\u0027t be lazy, do work and aim for the top. Self Made: Don\u0027t believe in any luck. Believe in your talent.",

I only heard the beginning and it was too much for me. I couldn’t hear it it, because it was too loud for me. I couldn’t identify it as music. I knew it was music, but for me it was just noise. I’m back again now and I even give a like. The song is pretty cool! I like how you played the mean role at first and then sometime you looked at the other side and contered. You did a great work! You knew exactly when you had to switch. And now I understand why this song is so popular. I’d rather place My Way or Till I’m on Top at 1st of your songs, but nobody has to be with me.

Everything was went great as far as I could tell and I had a referral from a manager backing me. I also have 9.5 years 850k safe driving miles and they still turned me down for the position. It really hit me hard. I don\u0027t need the job. But it was a great opportunity to really branch out and grow my income and knowledge. This was 2 days ago that they turned me down. I just discovered this artist today through a mix and searched for more stuff. This song really changed my mood and helped me clear my vision. I\u0027m gonna show them they made the wrong decision and progress my career forward without them and do even better than I could have with them.",

  "Fight Back - перевод на русский Ты никогда не добьешься этого. Ты недостаточно хорош. Есть миллион других людей с такими же навыками. Вы действительно думаете, что вы разные? Парень, ты, должно быть, шутишь. Думаю, ты собираешься ударить его, Но ты просто не понимаешь… Это невозможно, Маловероятно. Ты безответственный. Слишком много препятствий. Ты должен остановиться, эй. Ты не должен торопиться. Ты не можешь быть профессионалом. Не трать своё время больше. Да кто ты нахрен такой, Чтобы говорить мне, что делать? Мне плевать, если ты говоришь, что тебе это не нравится, Я собираюсь сделать свой шаг, Я собираюсь сделать это сейчас И я сделаю это, потому что это то, что я хочу сделать! Потому что все эти мнения, И все эти ситуации: Они идут миллионами, Они блокируют ваше видение, Но нет, Ты не должен слушать! Вся эта дрянь, всё это лишь выдумки! Потому что ты не сломаешься, как можно дольше! ——— Ты никогда не добьешься этого. Нет никакого способа, чтобы ты сделал это. Да, ты можешь притвориться. Но ты никогда не сделаешь это. Ты что? Заставь их вернуть их слова назад. Не говори мне, что ты веришь в их слова! Ты просто собираешься принять это? Или ты, черт возми, будешь сопротивляться?! ———— Ты не собираешься делать это. Ты никогда его не сломаешь. Ты никогда не сможешь победить их, да они лучшие!Они лучшие и ты видишь это! Думаю, что им просто наплевать, парень. Нет, им наплевать, что ты понял, что я тебе сказал. Я, бл@ть, не шучу! Я говорю всё как есть, парень. Есть слишком много других, и ты среди них не самый великий. Прекращай говорить! Прекращай что-либо делать! Все здесь знают, что ты просто подделка. Неа, я больше не хочу этого слышать! Я больше не хочу этого слышать! Все эти грёбанные мысли они уже не то, что мне нужно! Я закрыл эту грёбанную дверь! На всех вас, несчастные ненавистники витающие в облаках! Говорю, чтобы все слышали: “Ты лучше закрой свой чертов рот Ведь я сделаю больше, чем обещал До того как исчезну",

  "The Gospel ¨For God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.¨ John 3:16 ¨For i delivered to you first of all that which i also received: how Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, was buried, rose again the third day according to the scriptures,¨  1 Corinthians 15:3-4 ¨Jesus answered, ¨Truly, truly I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.¨  John 3:5 ¨that if you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God has raised from the dead, you will be saved,¨ Romans 10:9 The story: God loved the world(us) so much that He gave His one and only Son to die in our place. If you ever feel like you\u0027re not loved, remember the creator of the universe sent His Son to die in your place regardless if you believe in him or not! ¨Why did Jesus have to die?¨ Because all of God\u0027s creation has rebelled against Him at some point, Yes! Even You and I. When God created everything in existence, He looked at it and said ¨It is Good.¨ Well I think we can all agree humanity as a whole is not good! We were made in the image of God yet as whole we are not good. We kill, steal, lie, commit crimes, ignore the needy, don´t obey our parents, we break the laws, and humanity as a whole has done every sort of evil under the sun. ¨Well I\u0027m a good person!¨ To who´s standard? You have done at least one thing on the list above. Can you comfortably say lying is a trait of being a good person? What about stealing? You can say that but that would make you a liar and that would only prove my point. God creates the standard of good not us! His standard of good is perfect and none of us are perfect. Don´t let the arrogant ¨Christians¨ in church fool you either. They also are not perfect and need Jesus just as much as You and I. ¨So wait, why did Jesus have to die?¨ The answer is sin. We have all sinned and fell short of the glory of God. According to word, all of us will die someday and we will have to be face to face with God and give an account of everything we have ever done in our lives, good or bad. Your next question may be ¨does God know everything we have ever done?¨ The answer is yes, He is all knowing and Has a book of everything little thing you have ever done in your life and you will be judged off what you have done. Imagine this, you have to go to court to prove your innocence. You´re on trial and God is the judge. God will call your name and go through your book. He is going to ask why have you gone against him with the way you live and then ask if you think you really deserve to go to heaven. At this point any person would be terrified and speechless. How can we tell a perfect, Holy and all knowing God we deserve to go to heaven? We can´t! The bible says the wages of sin is death! In other words, one sin is enough to say you don\u0027t deserve to go to heaven. Wages means ¨something we have earned¨ when you work, your wages are a paycheck. When you sin, your wages are death. But the good news is if we place our trust in Jesus He acts as our lawyer. The Bible says he has the ability to blot out our sins! He can go in our book and remove anything that would keep us from going to heaven. How does that work exactly? Again the Bible says the wages of sin is death! Meaning for every sin something or someone has to die. Jesus came and died on the cross in our place. He took the punishment for us! He basically went into court and paid our fines so the judge could legally let us go. Jesus paid a price we could never afford.  So Where is Jesus now? He is in heaven! God is a just and good father. He would never send his child to hell. Want to hear the greatest news in the history of the world? ¨But to all who believed in him and accepted him, He gave the right to become children of God. They are reborn-not with a physical birth resulting from human passion or plan, but a birth that comes from God.¨ John 1:12-13 You can become a child of God! How do you do that? You have to believe in Jesus and His good news! What is the good news? The Gospel literally means the good news. This is the gospel: ¨I passed on to you what was most important and what had also passed on to me. 1.) Christ died for our sins, just as the scriptures said. 2.) He was buried, and 3.) He was raised on the third day, just as the Scriptures said.¨ 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 ¨Based on this how can I go to heaven?¨ ¨If you \u003copenly declare\u003e that Jesus is Lord and 2.) believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved For it is believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved. As the Scriptures tell us, ¨Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.¨ Romans 10:9-11 Jesus calls all men everywhere to repent(forsake sin).       Although God overlooked the periods of ignorance, now He commands everyone everywhere to repent. Acts 17:30.  But if the wicked turns from all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all My laws and does what is lawful and right, he will surely live, he will not die. Ezekiel 18:21 It\u0027s not just a confession of sins but a change of action. Without repentance we will not inherit the kingdom of God. Peter said to them, “Repent, and let each of you be immersed in the name of Messiah Yeshua for the removal of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Ruach ha-Kodesh. Acts 2:38      One who covers up his transgressions will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them finds mercy. Proverbs 28:13.  Following Jesus isn\u0027t just a one time thing or a prayer; it\u0027s a relationship with him until the very end.       But the one who endures to the end will be saved. Matthew 24:13.  If you are reading this all of this he is calling you to repentance he doesn\u0027t want you or anyone to perish but that all may be saved choose today whom you will serve.        For He says, “At a favorable time I listened to you, in a day of salvation I helped you.” Behold, now is the favorable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation. 2 Corinthians 6:2 To those who truly repent(turn from sins) and believe in Jesus/Yeshua you will be gifted the holy spirit which will give you the power to obey and God\u0027s laws will be written on your heart.       “This is the covenant that I will cut with them: ‘After those days,’ says Adonai , ‘I will put My Torah upon their hearts, and upon their minds I will write it,’” then He says,“I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.” Now where there is removal of these, there is no longer an offering for sin. Hebrews 10:16‭-‬18  Whatever we have done it can be forgiven only through the blood of messiah      for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the removal of sins. Matthew 26:28  God also gives us power over sin to not just to forgive us and save us. For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, training us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live in a manner that is self-controlled and righteous and godly in the present age.
