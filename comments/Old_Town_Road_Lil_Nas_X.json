I’m not ready for the 2030s, ain’t no way 2020 will be 6 years ago, I remember when 2014 was 6 years ago and we all saw how fast 6 turned to 10 years now. How is 2016 going to be 10 years ago next year, it was just 4 years ago??!! I started elementary school in September 2015, take me back! I hate high school so much. 2010 - 2019 was so peak. Mainly 2012 - 2016, then 2014 - 2017. I miss Summer 2012 - Summer 2018. Take me back please, I hate 2025, this year sucks so much. Take me to a place that I once knew that was filled with happiness and thrill and everything was possible. I went through so much these past 2 years since 2020. I\u0027m only 15 and I remember all of these, I started elementary school in September 2015 and graduated in June 2020, lol. That virtual graduation was so miserable, but these memories are coming back, my favorite school years would have to be 2015 - 2016 (Kindergarten), 2016 - 2017 (First Grade), and 2017 - 2018 (Second Grade), mainly because all of my teachers gave me best memories of my life/childhood and most of my friend group started from here. I seriously wish I could go back, I remember when the Fidget Spinner trend was popping out in 2016 and 2017 the teachers got annoyed with us about it, but we didn\u0027t care. I remember the \"DAB\" back when everyone was doing it and it was a whole thing during 2017, I remember in Kindergarten we had a \"Kindergarten Zoo\" basically it was us picking animals that we wanted to do and create a diorama of the animal and their habitat. After we watched Madagascar (chosen by me since it\u0027s one of my favorite movie franchises). I remember when Despacito came out, me and my friends entered a talent show and performed. I can\u0027t believe that was June 2017 and June 2018, I miss those days and I pray for those days to come back once more. I can\u0027t believe this song is almost 6 years old and considered a throwback, this was so big in 2019 and had everyone on a chokehold.",

  "Вы бы знали какой он сейчас. Так, рассказываю как я начала его не любить. В 4/5 лет мой брат слушал эту песню (Old Town Road), и эта песня мне очень понравилась! После этого, я частенько просила брата, что бы он включал эту песню.  Потом, я знала песни MONTERO, и разные другие.  Тогда, когда он был уже ге_м.  Я не знала конечно же что это означает, и хотела их тоже слушать. Я также просила его включить и эти песни, и он их включал, но ему было будто все равно, будто он тоже не знал что это, хотя ему уже было 12/13 лет.  Наверное, вы знаете эти клипы, и видели что там.  Но я продолжала слушать. Я подросла, мне было 11, и уже в этом раннем возрасте я узнала что это такое. Посмотрела клипы опять, чтобы по ностальгировать, но увидела эти сцены и моменты.  После этого, я больше не любила его. Но песню Old Town Road я обожала, и даже сейчас я просто не могу с нее.  Знаю весь текст, немного ошибаюсь, но, эта песня очень крутая.  Остальные альбомы и другие песни, для меня самые самые фушные.  Извините, если вам они нравятся, это чисто МОЕ мнение.",

  "A child is born weak in every way. Above all, he needs the affection he receives from his parents or caregivers. They are his role models, and he learns many of their habits. Over time, these habits become instinctive and are stored in memory, but he may also acquire wrong habits, such as favoritism towards siblings or other wrong habits. Religion may also be a wrong habit. A child\u0027s mind is not yet fully developed, so how can he choose a religion and learn about God at an early age? For example, reproduction in nature and science is natural. It is very likely that a child will come and worship strange things. For example, if I change my religion, leave my family, travel to a faraway country, get married, and have a child, my child will come and worship my new religion. What a wrong principle in choosing a religion! This is the greatest evidence that God created us with the heart and mind to know God when we grow up. I have a suggestion for you: Food and drink contain happy hormones. Fast for ten full days. Abstain from food and drink until sunset.  Go to your temple and repeat, fast for another ten days, go to the mosque and pray with the congregation. Read in your own language, and that\u0027s fine. Where does peace and tranquility come from when you are in direct communion with God? Life is short. How long will you live? More than a hundred years, and then you will die. Only your work will benefit you. Everyone will abandon you. If you like it, follow my posts and share the post so that everyone can benefit.",

  "A child is born weak in every way. Above all, he needs the affection he receives from his parents or caregivers. They are his role models, and he learns many of their habits. Over time, these habits become instinctive and are stored in memory, but he may also acquire wrong habits, such as favoritism towards siblings or other wrong habits. Religion may also be a wrong habit. A child\u0027s mind is not yet fully developed, so how can he choose a religion and learn about God at an early age? For example, reproduction in nature and science is natural. It is very likely that a child will come and worship strange things. For example, if I change my religion, leave my family, travel to a faraway country, get married, and have a child, my child will come and worship my new religion. What a wrong principle in choosing a religion! This is the greatest evidence that God created us with the heart and mind to know God when we grow up. I have a suggestion for you: Food and drink contain happy hormones. Fast for ten full days. Abstain from food and drink until sunset.  Go to your temple and repeat, fast for another ten days, go to the mosque and pray with the congregation. Read in your own language, and that\u0027s fine. Where does peace and tranquility come from when you are in direct communion with God? Life is short. How long will you live? More than a hundred years, and then you will die. Only your work will benefit you. Everyone will abandon you. If you like it, follow my posts and share the post so that everyone can benefit.",

  "HAPPY 6TH ANNIVERSARY TO OLD TOWN ROAD!!! THE FACT THIS IS OVER HALF A DECADE OLD HURTS SO MUCH. I wanna be happy and go back to the 2010s. I’m not ready for the 2030s, ain’t no way 2020 will be 6 years ago, I remember when 2014 was 6 years ago and we all saw how fast 6 turned to 10 years now. How is 2016 going to be 10 years ago next year, it was just 4 years ago??!! I started elementary school in September 2015, take me back! I hate high school so much. 2010 - 2019 was so peak. Mainly 2012 - 2016, then 2014 - 2017. I miss Summer 2012 - Summer 2018. Take me back please, I hate 2025, this year sucks so much. Take me to a place that I once knew that was filled with happiness and thrill and everything was possible. I went through so much these past 2 years since 2020. I\u0027m only 15 and I remember all of these, I started elementary school in September 2015 and graduated in June 2020, lol. That virtual graduation was so miserable, but these memories are coming back, my favorite school years would have to be 2015 - 2016 (Kindergarten), 2016 - 2017 (First Grade), and 2017 - 2018 (Second Grade), mainly because all of my teachers gave me best memories of my life/childhood and most of my friend group started from here. I seriously wish I could go back, I remember when the Fidget Spinner trend was popping out in 2016 and 2017 the teachers got annoyed with us about it, but we didn\u0027t care. I remember the \"DAB\" back when everyone was doing it and it was a whole thing during 2017, I remember in Kindergarten we had a \"Kindergarten Zoo\" basically it was us picking animals that we wanted to do and create a diorama of the animal and their habitat. After we watched Madagascar (chosen by me since it\u0027s one of my favorite movie franchises). I remember when Despacito came out, me and my friends entered a talent show and performed. I can\u0027t believe that was June 2017 and June 2018, I miss those days and I pray for those days to come back once more. I can\u0027t believe this song is almost 6 years old and considered a throwback, this was so big in 2019 and had everyone on a chokehold. July 19, 2019 - July 19, 2025.",

  "Aqui vai um resumo bem organizado sobre os temas que você pediu, com explicações claras: --- ### **1. Classificação das Ondas quanto à propagação no espaço:** - **Unidimensionais:** Propagam-se em uma única direção (ex: onda em uma corda esticada). - **Bidimensionais:** Propagam-se em um plano (ex: ondas na superfície da água). - **Tridimensionais:** Propagam-se em todas as direções (ex: som no ar). --- ### **2. Quanto à direção da vibração:** - **Ondas Longitudinais:** A vibração é **na mesma direção** da propagação (ex: som no ar). - **Ondas Transversais:** A vibração é **perpendicular** à direção de propagação (ex: corda vibrando). - **Ondas Mistas:** Possuem componentes longitudinais e transversais (ex: ondas no mar). --- ### **3. Quanto à natureza:** - **Ondas Mecânicas:** Precisam de um meio material para se propagar (ex: som, ondas em corda, água). - **Ondas Eletromagnéticas:** **Não precisam de meio material**, podem se propagar no vácuo (ex: luz, micro-ondas, raios X). --- ### **4. Cálculo do comprimento de onda e da velocidade:** - **Fórmulas principais:**   - **v \u003d λ · f**     - *v* \u003d velocidade da onda     - *λ* \u003d comprimento de onda     - *f* \u003d frequência da onda   - Se souber o tempo (*T*), use: **λ \u003d v · T** --- ### **5. Características do som:** - **Intensidade:** Relacionada à **força/volume** do som. Depende da amplitude. - **Altura:** Relacionada à **frequência**. Sons agudos têm alta frequência; graves, baixa. - **Timbre:** Permite distinguir dois sons de mesma altura e intensidade. Está ligado à forma da onda (harmônicos). --- Se quiser, posso montar um mapa mental com isso tudo. Quer?",

  "A child is born weak in every way. Above all, he needs the affection he receives from his parents or caregivers. They are his role models, and he learns many of their habits. Over time, these habits become instinctive and are stored in memory, but he may also acquire wrong habits, such as favoritism towards siblings or other wrong habits. Religion may also be a wrong habit. A child\u0027s mind is not yet fully developed, so how can he choose a religion and learn about God at an early age? For example, reproduction in nature and science is natural. It is very likely that a child will come and worship strange things. For example, if I change my religion, leave my family, travel to a faraway country, get married, and have a child, my child will come and worship my new religion. What a wrong principle in choosing a religion! This is the greatest evidence that God created us with the heart and mind to know God when we grow up. I have a suggestion for you: Food and drink contain happy hormones. Fast for ten full days. Abstain from food and drink until sunset.  Go to your temple and repeat, fast for another ten days, go to the mosque and pray with the congregation. Read in your own language, and that\u0027s fine. Where does peace and tranquility come from when you are in direct communion with God? Life is short. How long will you live? More than a hundred years, and then you will die. Only your work will benefit you. Everyone will abandon you. If you like it, follow my posts and share the post so that everyone can benefit.",

  "Muslim: Let me ask you something. Do you believe that everything has a cause and purpose? Seeker: Yes, I believe that. Muslim: Then, this vast universe, with its precise order, couldn\u0027t have come into existence by chance. It must have a Wise Creator. Seeker: Maybe, but how can you prove that Islam is the true religion among others? Muslim: Islam supports its message with rational and practical evidence. The greatest of these is the Quran itself. Did you know that the Quran contains scientific miracles confirmed by modern science? Seeker (curiously): Scientific miracles? Like what? Muslim: Let me share some clear examples: 1. Embryonic development: The Quran says: \"Then We created the drop into a clinging clot, and We created the clot into a lump, and We created the lump into bones, and We covered the bones with flesh.\" (Quran, 23:14) Modern embryology, discovered centuries later, confirms that the human embryo indeed develops in these exact stages. 2. Expansion of the universe: The Quran states: \"And the heaven, We constructed it with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander.\" (Quran, 51:47) Scientists, through the Big Bang theory and ongoing astronomical observations, now know that the universe is continuously expanding. 3. Mountains as stabilizers: The Quran describes mountains as \"pegs\": \"Have We not made the earth a resting place? And the mountains as pegs?\" (Quran, 78:6-7) Geology confirms that mountains have deep roots that stabilize the earth\u0027s crust. Seeker (impressed): That\u0027s fascinating! How could a book from the 7th century contain such advanced knowledge? Muslim: That\u0027s the point. The Quran is not just a book of guidance but a divine revelation from the Creator, containing knowledge that no human could have known at the time. Seeker: I see. Maybe it\u0027s time I read the Quran for myself. Muslim (smiling): Absolutely. Seek the truth with an open heart, and you\u0027ll find it.",

  "Idk how it would have worked out if they released his original version worldwide on radio, tv, the internet, \u0026 \u0027media\u0027 in general ; considering the beat is a combination of the primary Trent Reznar / NiN production \u0026 Kio\u0027s remixing it into a popish beat.  However, i still think he would have made a buttload more money than he ended up making. I am talking him making as much money off this single track as he eventually made off of his entire library combined. They likely never would have gifted him a career though if he tried that ! They had to get the rights to the Master of the track, which led to the remixing of the aong before it was truly pushed. They, of course, helped him settle all the legal liability in the process, HOWEVER: *THEY NEEDED TO REMIX TO OBTAIN THAT ALL IMPORTANT MASTER COPY, AND GIVE THE SLAVE THE SLAVE COPY.* [IT IS IN ALL ACTUALITY CALLED A SLAVE COPY...
