{Children voice ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1. Kid( nagarjuna )  is changing himself to attract parents and doing what father (naga chaithanya) and mother (samantha)  likes. Note : I forgot characters name. 2. Kid wants to fulfill his childhood untold memories within himself. He is listen every word of his parents, because past years he wants to talk with them many things happend his life. 3. Kid is playing with his parents 4. Kid don't there birthdays because both are orphans. That is why he wants to celebrate, mother's day and father's day 5. Again kid  is treating his parents as children only because they were younger than him 6. Kid  wants to remember past life experiences to mother, I didn't understand father experience. 7.  He is father and mother died in car accident, this black and concept is connected to movie. 8.Both are adults, so they know what is love, that's why they're crying by watching heartbreaking climax. 9. Dog is also crying - to represent animals has also feeling 10. When dad saw other woman, kid is telling you have my mom. " Imagination of kid"}

{Song translation... Kani penchina maa ammake ammayyaanugaa For the mom, who gave me birth and raised me…I am her mother now Nadipinchina maa naannake naannayyaanugaa For the dad, who taught me how to walk…I am his father now Okaridhi kannu okaridhi choopu…Iruvuri kalayika kanti choopu One of them is eye and the other is vision…both of them together form the vision of my eyes Okaridi maata okaridi bhaavam…Iruvuri kadhalika kadhipina kadha One of them is word and the other is its meaning…both of them together form the story of my life Idhi premaa premaa...Thirigoche thiyyagaa This is love!...It came back to me dearly Iddi premaa premaa…Edhuroche haayigaa This is love!...It found me happily Idhi manasuni thadimina…Thadipina kshanamu kadhaa This is the moment that touched my heart the most A, Aa, e, ee nerpina…Ammaki guruvunu avuthunnaa I am turning into a teacher for my mother who taught me alphabets Adugulu nadakalu nerpina…Naannaki maargam avuthunnaa I am turning in to a path for the father who taught me walking Pillalu veelle avuthundagaa…Aa allari nene choosthundagaa I am witnessing the mischief of these kids who are my parents Kannollatho nenu chinnodilaa…Kalagalisina egasina bigisina katha I am spending time with my parents like a kid…This is a story close to my heart || Idhi prema prema ||  Kammani buvvanu kalipina chethini devatha antunnaa This hand which fed me tasty food is my goddess Kannula neetini thudichina veliki kovela kaduthunnaa I would build a temple for this hand which wiped my tears Jolalu naake paadaarugaa…Aa jaalini marichi polenugaa You both sang lullabies to me…I would never forget your affection Meeroopinaa aa ooyala naa…Hrudhayapu layalalo padhilamu kadha You swayed me in the cradle of love…all these moments are treasured in my heart || Idhi prema prema ||  ( Copied)}

{I'm greatly surprised at the No of people who have given thumbs down to this superb heart-touching song. This shows that how much we have not only diversified in caste, religion, beliefs but also in inner feelings, which in this case constitute the fundamentals of humanity. Why should India be happy and prosperous with these kind of anti-Human elements floating around?? God alone can wipe them off.}
{The highlight of the Song is the voice of Mr.Bharat. What a beautiful pitch he has maintained and hatsoff to the Music Director for creating such a fabulous song in such a beautiful way and kudos to Chandra Bose for his heart touching lyrics. Just Incredible.!! A perfect song befitting a outstanding movie. Congratulations to the Manam team for creating a great piece of art work and fitting and memorable tribute to ever-green ANR..}
