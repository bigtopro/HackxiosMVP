It was for \"Loitering\" by Jason Ferris of Laguna Beach police department It was 2013 Jason Ferris wrote me the ticket at the Laguna Beach homeless shelter on Laguna canyon road. A loitering ticket in 2013. I tried two times calling and emailing Jason Ferris and all he did was brag to me about his promotion from Corporal to lieutenant. I was asleep fully clothed when Jason Ferris in 2013 woke me up and wrote me a loitering ticket telling me it would help get in the shelter quicker after Damon told me I had to leave the hotel above.  I had permission from the shelter staff to be there with 5 other people and I was the only one written a ticket.  Then the shelter staff took the ticket and said they\u0027d take care of it on Laguna canyon road.

  "The phrase “Niggas in Paris,” popularized by the song from Jay-Z and Kanye West’s 2011 collaborative album Watch the Throne, has become a cultural touchstone, resonating deeply within the realms of hip-hop, fashion, and global identity. Though the phrase itself is rooted in the specific context of African-American experiences, it has garnered significance far beyond its original usage. By exploring the implications of the phrase through a more advanced lens—examining race, culture, and geography—it is possible to better understand how the term evolves in different contexts and how it reflects the intersection of African-American identity with global spaces. The Significance of Place: Paris as a Symbol Paris, often called the \"City of Light,\" has long been associated with artistic revolution, intellectual freedom, and a legacy of multiculturalism. From the Harlem Renaissance to the African diaspora’s connection to French intellectualism, Paris has historically been a destination for African and African-American artists, intellectuals, and cultural figures seeking refuge from the racial tensions of America. It is within this rich history that Jay-Z and Kanye West’s decision to reference Paris in their song holds deep significance. By placing \"niggas\"—a colloquialism heavily loaded with both empowerment and historical trauma—within the context of Paris, the artists frame their own cultural identity as not only global but also transcendent of the racial limitations often imposed in the United States. The phrase implicitly critiques the historical isolation of black people within American society, while simultaneously celebrating a cultural reclamation of space—both physical and intellectual—in the global arena. The inclusion of Paris is an acknowledgement of a world where African-American culture has found influence far beyond its country of origin. The Reclamation of a Term The term \"nigga\" itself is loaded with complex cultural and historical baggage. Originally a derogatory term used to dehumanize enslaved Africans, it has been reappropriated by some in the African-American community as a means of defiance, empowerment, and solidarity. The reappropriation of the term is not without controversy; its use among African-Americans can signify a reclaiming of power over a word once used to diminish them. However, its use by others, particularly outside the African-American community, remains highly problematic. In the context of “Niggas in Paris,” the term signifies both a self-awareness and a celebration of success against historical odds. The song’s use of the term isn’t just an assertion of identity; it’s a recognition of the power of African-American cultural production—hip-hop, in particular—to influence and reshape global narratives. The phrase encapsulates the idea that African-American culture, once marginalized, has moved beyond the confines of race and place to become a force that reshapes international spaces. Globalization and Cultural Influence The concept of “Niggas in Paris” also reflects the broader phenomenon of globalization. The term captures the intersection between the hyper-local (African-American culture) and the cosmopolitan (Paris as a global cultural center). This tension between the local and the global is emblematic of how contemporary hip-hop culture has transcended national boundaries and become a dominant global cultural force. In Paris, as in many other major cities around the world, African-American music, fashion, and culture have been absorbed, reinterpreted, and celebrated. Jay-Z and Kanye West themselves are not just American artists—they are global icons. Their influence extends far beyond the United States, shaping not only the soundtracks of cities like Paris but also the trends that define luxury, style, and modernity. The phrase \"Niggas in Paris\" therefore symbolizes a broader cultural movement where African-American influence is no longer relegated to the margins of society but is central to global culture. Racial Identity and the Ambiguity of \"Niggas in Paris\" While the phrase “Niggas in Paris” carries connotations of empowerment and celebration of African-American culture, it also prompts reflection on the complexities of racial identity in a globalized world. By placing the term “niggas” alongside Paris, a city that has long been associated with notions of cosmopolitanism and privilege, there is an implicit commentary on the contradictions inherent in African-American experiences. In many ways, it underscores the tension between the desire for acceptance and recognition in global spaces and the reality of enduring racial inequality. The phrase also speaks to the ways in which African-American culture has had to negotiate its place within these global spaces. In Paris, black culture is often both celebrated and commodified—artists like Jay-Z and Kanye West, while celebrated, also navigate the complex dynamics of being both celebrated and \"othered.\" The tension between the aspiration to be universally embraced and the persistent challenges of racism—whether in Paris, New York, or elsewhere—is part of the subtext of the song. Conclusion: A Multifaceted Expression of Identity In conclusion, the phrase “Niggas in Paris” operates on multiple levels, offering a rich commentary on race, culture, and global influence. By juxtaposing the term “nigga” with Paris, Jay-Z and Kanye West are not only celebrating the success of African-American culture but are also engaging with a globalized world where boundaries of race and geography are increasingly fluid. This phrase encapsulates the spirit of modern hip-hop—one that acknowledges both the historical burdens of race and the transformative power of culture. To reframe this phrase in a more \"advanced\" or formal sense would be to lose some of the vitality and immediacy of its original meaning. The phrase itself is a testament to the ability of language and culture to evolve, taking something once meant to demean and transforming it into a powerful statement of identity, resilience, and global influence.",

  "A distinguished young African-American gentleman, refined in both manner and appearance, finds himself immersed in the heart of Paris, the capital of France. He is dressed in a sharply tailored charcoal-grey suit, the fabric glinting subtly in the late afternoon light. His crisp white shirt and a silk tie in a muted shade of maroon complement his polished look, while a classic wristwatch peeks out from beneath his cuff, marking the passage of time with precision. His skin, smooth and rich in tone, contrasts beautifully with his attire, and his neatly groomed hair enhances the sophistication of his overall appearance. As he strolls along the grand boulevards, his leather shoes make soft, rhythmic clicks against the cobblestone streets. The Seine River flows calmly to his right, its surface glimmering under the golden hue of the setting sun. The iconic Eiffel Tower rises in the distance, casting long shadows across the cityscape, while the faint aroma of fresh croissants and brewing espresso drifts from the numerous sidewalk cafés lining the street. He pauses momentarily in front of a patisserie, where the smell of warm pastries tempts him, but he continues on, eager to explore more of the city’s wonders. His gaze is thoughtful, taking in the blend of modernity and history that defines Paris. The old-world charm of the Haussmannian buildings, with their ornate facades and wrought-iron balconies, contrasts with the sleek design of contemporary art galleries and high-end boutiques. The Arc de Triomphe looms large in the distance, a reminder of the city’s rich history, while the buzz of conversations in French and other languages fills the air, giving the city its cosmopolitan feel. As he walks, he exchanges polite nods with passersby, some of whom are tourists clutching maps and cameras, while others are locals, effortlessly chic in their casual attire. A soft breeze tousles the leaves of the plane trees that line the avenues, and the distant hum of a street musician playing a soulful tune on a saxophone adds a layer of melody to the city’s soundscape. The gentleman, with his poised and thoughtful demeanor, seems perfectly at home amidst the elegance and vibrancy of Paris, blending the timeless grace of the city with his own quiet dignity. Approaching the Louvre Museum, he slows his pace, taking in the sight of the iconic glass pyramid glinting in the waning light. He marvels at the juxtaposition of the modern architecture against the backdrop of the classical museum, reflecting on the layers of culture, art, and history that permeate the city. As the streetlights flicker to life and the soft glow of the evening descends, he takes a seat at a café terrace, ordering a café au lait and a pain au chocolat, savoring the moment as he watches the world pass by. The rhythm of Paris, the City of Light, wraps around him as he sits, poised and contemplative, in this timeless yet ever-evolving metropolis.",

  "My brother, my sister, I know, life is hard. You are probably going through a very difficult time, and you have the impression that it is getting worse and worse, you don\u0027t know who to confide in, because the world is turning its back on you, your family can\u0027t understand you, or maybe -maybe you\u0027re simply afraid that he won\u0027t understand you. You are no longer sure of having real friends, you no longer sleep at night, you are tired, mentally, physically, spiritually. This world calls you weak, and you start to believe it, you are desperate. Know it, God is with you, he sees your pain, your suffering, your loneliness and he wants to help you and is just waiting for that. But for that, you have to open the door for him. God loves you with a love so pure that he sent his only son Jesus Christ to save you from death. So return to him and your heart will be at peace. BE BLESSED",

nosotros consultaban los cristianos y luego dijimos que los cristianos que nunca vamos a escapar de esa maldición de hipótesis resbala en Inglaterra después que le gustan los audios con los americanos que fueron los los los jamaiquinos cómo iban a poner los afroamericanos diciendo que esos son los mejores negros que hay en la tierra pues sabían que los negros haitianos nunca dejaron de que ofendieron a los afroamericanos de no saben cómo son el Jaime aquí no estaban llenas ahí la antes que ellos entonces se dieron cuenta que eso eran los piratas existían acá entonces cuando nosotros llegamos en Haití nos dimos cuenta que los camarinos ya estaban en esa Isla entonces lo mismo sí que ellos tenían piratas ellos vinieron con Cristóbal Colón muchas veces y se hizo fueron los primeros esclavos que se escaparon pero ellos no habían esclavos sino que ellos tienen un capitán negro como tú igual que tú eres por eso los jamaiquinos se quedan pensando si tú realmente resucitaste de su capital entonces ellos están pensando que ese negro era igual es que estoyde utopía son negocios y ellos también navegaban por los mayas y fueron ellos que se quedaron en esa Isla entonces de ustedes ya conocían la isla de Haití antes de venir a distrito se dieron cuenta que fue que vinieron los africanos de allá de de África que lo siguieron para viajar a los mejores africanos de África entonces ellos llegaron a África al América con todos ustedes dijeron que ustedes no van a pelear nada por ello todo lo que querían era venirse ahí toda su gente y su mujer y su familia como si fuese como esclavo ustedes sabían que nosotros fingimos ser esclavos para venir con ellos para luego pensar cómo nos quedaríamos ahí y luego usted no quisieron llevarse nosotros los cristianos que no hemos sido antes la isla para que ustedes nos vengan a traicionarnos y a pelearnos porque usted no sabían cómo llegar por allá porque estaba detrás de Miami y él no lo podían ver la isla si no iban a ver okay la Cuba y así se va a quedar la propiedad uno con los cubanos nosotros hablamos con los cubanos les dijimosaprendemos hechicería la brujería desde África por eso el changan se quedó pensando que si yo lo traicionero no lo voy a traicionado sí lo voy a traicionar y dijo mira no nunca te dije no porque él siempre se quedó como uno de nosotros como un yogur como un Yoruba era un Yoruba lo que pasa que no entiende que los Yoruba son gubernamentales sino que yo no quieren gobernar como la gente como los luchadores Yo quiero gobernar como los nacionalistas y se dan cuenta que los youtubers sino de poder a alguien para apoderarse de ellos sino que lo dejan que ellos vivan libre según su mentalidad pero ellos saben que nosotros tenemos El poder del militar y se dan cuenta que nosotros lo llamamos entonces ellos se asustan y piensan que nosotros estamos jalando y realmente si no estamos jalando porque los yorubas no intervenimos o los agentes a los delincuentes nosotros lo entregamos a la cárcel y lo entregamos a la poesía así no lo matamos sino que lo metemos en las prisiones pero no impresiones para que estén como si no fuesen precios no para que yo pagué mi castigo de los que están haciendo incluso como yo estoy pagando así como lo pago aquí yo estoy pagando y me dijeron que yo debo sentirme orgulloso de que un gubernamental me pongas como prisioneros dentro de mi propio hogar porque así es como los dioses y los reyes alababan El más grande de todos los prisioneros porque así es entenderle a todo el mundo que es el mejor gubernamental y sabían de que querían ocultar de que fuesen conocido como un Yoruba como una gente grande que no es grande sino que es grande porque se quiso nada siendo todo y se supo saberse así como se abrió un rey entonces sabría de que Yoruba también se fue un rey por el único Yoruba que fue más grande que todo a medida que fui yo porque así le dijo y volví porque el espíritu que tenía sobre la faz del cielo estaría bajo el corregimiento de Rafael Gabriel y Miguel y Sasha cel así conocerías de que ese sería pues el príncipe y luego sería ascendido a Dios y tendría pues el control igual que al jefe rey de reyes y señor de señores que estarían pues los Ángeles bajo su autoridad tantos como las humanidades después de la muerte estaría exigiendo el mundo después de su vida en su día para conocer de que él fue el más grande del mundo mental de que Dante porque hasta Dante quería ser como yo dijo no él va a ser mejor que yo que no tenía nada de sensibilidad nada de corazón Dante lo único que quería era querer para darle una puñalada y luego no sentí nada y estamos loca de la cuñada y lo mataste y si lo quería querer pero lo hacía como lo quería creer así como lo tenía así como lo vería como el rey y así sabía que Dante era igual que tú no sentías sentimientos entonces antes no pude entender de que es un criminal y de que no quería la gente él quería igual que tú a bañarte de la gente y luego manipularlo como experimentarle como un como un como un como un como unno descubrió que tú también era un alquimista y quería saber que como un alquimista criminal que no sabía por qué lo quería así como lo quería así como lo tenía y pensaba que no quería sino que no sabía cómo quería la gente lo quería haber muerto lo quería haber enterrado porque él también quería saber dónde iba el alma igual que el alma dónde estaba el alma entonces se quedó pensando por qué tú te dejaste de conocer de mí porque así Yo no te voy a poder seleccionar como traicionarías diciendo que yo también te quería igual que Napoleón igual que Bonaparte yo solamente quería saber por qué tú no estabas bajo su potestad y por qué te iba a ser libre igual que ellos y si dio cuenta que el rosario descubrió antes que ellos entonces se dio cuenta que tú también querías criminal con nosotros criminales fundamentales entonces te dije te voy a enviar todos esos criminales gubernamentales para ver que ellos piensan así el primero que te voy a enseñar Barack Obama ese te va a ser la vida imposible como criminal y luego dice que te quería como te quería para decirte que él también sabía como franca yeri pues no se da cuenta que tú también lo querías así como lo quería así como lo tendría así como lo pensaría me dio cuenta que tú le pensaste así como le pensaste que dijimos que tú lo iba a ayudar porque tú puedes pasarle a alguien él porque él se dio cuenta que le dijimos que tú sabes que eso también se queda grabado por la vida eterna y todavía siguen viviendo la gente del mundo mental y los muertos van a ese lugar donde yo estaba y se quedan y entran dentro de ese video Giovanni y ella y tú lo estás viendo que se están meneando así como se merece pregunta que se pongan tanto así entrenamiento y sale así no te das cuenta que es un demonio que se parece a tu mamá porque le sacaron un demonio y tu mamá para recoger su personalidad luego a confundirte cuando te voy a hablar con el demonio de tu mamá vaya a hablar con ella y su madre quiénes son ellos en ellos y van a saber que ha sido devoraban de calle güey así se burlaban de ellos así como se están burlando mira que nosotros somos mejor que tú ves que tú no eres nadie para que tú eres un pequeño creación de una masonería que te ponen un poquillo un poquito de voltaje para que tú pienses voltaje que tú tienes tu potabilidad y te voy a voltaje pero Kevin Clinton era más malo que John Bush porque es muy malo que no era malo cuando cuando te arrepentirás negro El grito le dijo y salió dijo aunque un ejército dijo no temas porque aunque un ejército acampe contra mí no temerá mi corazón porque Jehová siempre estará contigo y conmigo amén hijo kanye Wesley si no teman y canta la canción en Francia porque yo era un soldado con macro cómo hacer cómo

There was nothing else like it at the time. It was the biggest thing ever in middle school at my school haha! All these young jits would be walking around the halls on “iPod day” singing the insane lyrics of this song and playing it on repeat. I had just randomly remembered today the “balls so hard mfs wanna find me” and sang it in my head so I came back to this masterpiece. I always knew “big brother” Jay-Z was behind this song, but i didn’t remember who was on it with him. Sure enough, it was the great KANYE WEST. This timeless hit only further solidifies the great YE WEST as the greatest of our time you guys!!! Stay blessed everyone if you’re reading this and made it this far.

  "About two days ago you were on TicTok with Big Boy from 92.3. You said \"I\u0027m positive the culture is negative\". When you said it my first thought was Ye just said he is HIV Positive. I know that\u0027s not what you said, I\u0027m not saying you are, that\u0027s just what I thought. Oh yeah you said \"the culture spreads fear\". Anyways I was thinking about it for last two days. I wrote a couple years ago that I don\u0027t have HIV AIDS. I had the impression someone was lying on me saying I had it. I remember I went \u0026 took a HIV test \u0026 showed my test results to the camera on my phone \u0026 took a picture \u0026 showed. I did a second HIV AIDS sometime later \u0026 once again I\u0027m clean. I took pictures of my results or paperwork \u0026 showed it on my phone. I remember at the time, I don\u0027t know if it was one of those computer experts or not but t Presodent Biden image was on the social media saying he thought I was the one who was crying \u0026 begging for someone not to let people know \"I\u0027m sick\" \u0026 I was like that wasn\u0027t me. I think that\u0027s why I did a second test \u0026 posted my results a second time, I remember I went to a facility , can\u0027t remember name of it but it said it was dedicated by Maxine Waters , she got the funding for it. Anyways I then saw Biden walking on Whitehouse lawn \u0026 he said something about having a cure in 10years \u0026 I wrote at the time that I thought that meant they already have a cure for it, there just working out the details on the money. I don\u0027t know if you said your positive like saying you have good energy or if you were forced to let the public know you are positive but did it in a way that people wouldn\u0027t notice but whoever forced you to say it couldn\u0027t say you didn\u0027t say it or tell the public.

We’ll even choose to take the 4WD with no air conditioning just cause that car has a sub \u0026 we know this song will be on repeat!! Even us whities love this song!! 😂😅 ‘Ye once said in a interview he has that “disorder” where he physically sees sounds. Some people who have it hear colours but can’t see them, others smell letters, it’s the most fascinating thing. ‘Ye physically sees sounds so he literally paints his beats like a canvas in his mind, not knowing what it’ll sound like till he puts it together \u0026 they always sound on point!! He said he didn’t realise as a kid that was “abnormal”. I’d love to be able to see what he hears!! I regret not looking into ‘Ye more years ago, watching FULL interviews rather than clips \u0026 articles. He’s the most fascinating human being. I don’t care what anyone says.  It’s almost like he’s an extension of Tupac (another fascinating, amazing human being!!!). Their lives are so similar too. Tupac’s Mum was a Black Panther, ‘Ye’s Dad was. Tupac’s Dad (who he looked to as a Dad, Mutulu I think he was?) was an academic, ‘Ye’s Mum was. Both ‘Ye \u0026 Tupac grew up talking about history \u0026 other important deep subjects around the table \u0026 reading the same thick impactful books most kids their age couldn’t digest. Both have dreams \u0026 aspirations of making the world better!! They’re so similar \u0026 it makes me smile to see that now.  ‘Ye might not be able to please everyone all the time, nobody can, but he’s still learning \u0026 growing too, going through his awakening \u0026 soul searching, sharing his raw thoughts \u0026 fears \u0026 one things for certain… he never does anything from a malicious place. He genuinely is just trying to be better every day \u0026 spark global awareness \u0026 change \u0026 he’s a real one, no BS with him, just straight honesty, something everyone says they want \u0026 appreciate in people but seems some people only really want that from some people \u0026 not from others clearly. He’s been randomly showing up at random Churches \u0026 community centres these past months. He just wants to learn, grow \u0026 understand where his place in life is \u0026 where he can help. He’s searching. Sometimes Paps run up on him while he’s shaking hands \u0026 hugging everyone outside before going in \u0026 if you listen closely, you’ll always hear at least a few people say things like “great to see you again!!, “haven’t seen you here for a while, was hoping you’d come back”, ect so he’s been doing it for some time on the DL. What other “celebrity” does that?? He’s not content with only being a musician. That was just a gateway to greater things. He knows in his heart he can help people \u0026 make positive change. Sometimes he might struggle to find the right words to his immense thoughts, sometimes he’s completely misunderstood \u0026 misinterpreted too, but his heart is good, pure, genuine, honest \u0026 we should never knock anyone down for that just cause their life experiences don’t align with ours so our perceptions are different. There’s no “right or wrong” thing to say or believe, there’s only different perceptions based on different life experiences. That’s all life really is. A collaboration of different perceptions.

Kanye plays his games in real life in case you missed them to the same degree I would test a new video game he tests life\u0027s games played by real people. This is also why you can edit curse or racial or lgbtq slurs by using number symbols such as !@#$%^\u0026*()_-+\u003d in between the first and last letter of a slur word.

These songs are the 8th wonder of the world! It will sell more copies than any album in history!\" \"That is unless they manage to stop me. That\u0027s mein struggle — er, I mean my struggle.\" Ye\u0027s music production house GOOD Music also put out a press release to promote the new album. The tracklist will include singles \"New ‘Stache Flow,\" \"Yeezus Walks (Into Poland),\" and \"(They Are) Heartless.\" The announcement has been met with condemnation from the Jewish community, but praise from Donald Trump, who was apparently unaware of the controversy surrounding it. \"Yes, I know struggle, so much struggle. No one has struggled as much as I have,\" said Trump regarding the album release. \"Kanye is a fine person who has said very nice things about me. I can\u0027t wait to listen to his new album about his struggle, even though it\u0027s probably not as big of a struggle as my struggle.\" At publishing time, Ye\u0027s record company also announced they have booked two tour dates: one in Dawson Springs, Kentucky, and the other for ISIS. - Babylon Bee",

All the symbols that were flashing in the video are all Illuminati signs. Wake up... Kanye is NOT crazy he\u0027s scares fod his life and he\u0027s been speaking facts for years. They can\u0027t take Kanye out bc hes too famous right now and is kim Kardashians childrens father. They did hurry up and make his finances dwindle down through Adidas and all.",

  "HOW PEOPLE\u0027S LIVES ARE ADMINISTERED 1st choice: comfortable life (human contacts, fun, relationships, easy work) 2nd choice: remedy the one made by the first choice (all the opposite of the life of the first)  3rd choice, etc.: no personality suitable to survive, probable life as a tramp (in the middle of the street), absolutely no human contact, fun, future, precious things, relationships. With the personality they give you to do all these things it will be too complicated. Probable acts of violence or discrimination, no work or if there is very hard. High probability of suicide.  Procedure: there comes a time when suddenly Christ and Satan show up in front of the mirror and by deception force to choose one of the two. By choosing the first, the following things happen: Christ, the Virgin Mary and in case some saints show up and in case you are playing or having fun in any way they force you to work and toil helping someone always with their voice and their words inside your head. Their procedure consists of this: prevent you from having fun, drinking, masturbating, etc. and getting sledding like a mule.      Being as they say second choice, you should only work from morning to night and nothing else. Anything else is not good for them. At first Christ pretends to be God and shows you how he pretends to give you gifts by putting for a moment a kind of white glow at the height of the navel and telling you that they give a \"gift\" to everyone and no more than one but in reality, they are all lies that as you go on, they come out on their own. They try to frame you with vague promises, rewards and various scum once in what they call \"paradise\", but once they verify that the element in question doesn\u0027t take the bait (because he’s not a moron!) they begin to reveal their infamous procedures that they have implemented to try to ruin his life.   As a second choice you are given a very antisocial, extreme and stray personality so that you cannot have any kind of contact with other people (friendships, relationships) because you see everyone else as if they came from another planet and there is no kind of compatibility. In addition to this your physique is damaged with the following things and for the following reasons: first you will have few or no muscles at all as having been damaged at birth you will be sick and you will have a disposition to make revenge and war against everyone; per second you will have some knee problems that will prevent you from practicing any type of sport in a serious way and third you will have some kind of defect or imperfection in intimate parts such as various spots, in, strange shapes, etc. so as to prevent you from having any kind of relationship.      The second choice should according to their infamous system try to remedy the wrong things that someone who died 40 years ago or more has combined.  In paradise a kind of personal \"circle\" is created where there are the spirits of all the people who have had some kind of importance in your life: family members, sports idols, musicians, actors or characters compatible with your personality or with the life you have to make. All these characters are obliged to show up and say certain phrases with the purpose of deceiving and doing things that the person in question would not do in itself. They also take advantage of the relationship of admiration you had for them when they were alive to get you to have a conversation, but it\u0027s all a lie, the real purpose is to analyze your way of thinking and acting and your personality to see if you can overcome certain obstacles, cheating and lies that will try to get you on the road.     Of all the characters you see the Virgin Mary is the most annoying of all. She talks all the time saying a lot of lies to see if someone is so stupid to believe in it (like their altar boys) and she always and constantly repeats the same things until nausea (procedure). She cries all the time and says she\u0027s the most beautiful woman in the world.      Their way of speaking is to repeat in your head their phrases that irritate and provoke and annoy you to the point of nausea as the angriest you are, the more your nerves jump and the more vulnerable you are to them because you could lose control of your actions and do what they want. They never believe in threats to make them stop until they are put into practice.  At the beginning of the journey if you rebel against their infamous system, they can resort to making the devil appear. Not having chosen him appears much poorer than he appears to his followers. He can appear in many different forms but usually appears with red eyes and the stick it uses to subdue its followers. Among the things he does to you we find: images of spiders quite credible in the head, temptations of various kinds very treacherous. At first it makes you think he wants to take you into his group by always making you trawls to try to frame yourself (for example women you might have, things that might happen to you, etc.) and then tries to bother you at night by showing you his red eyes, goat legs, strange faces and telling you to come to his group. To try to submit use a kind of feeling of great warmth at the height of the navel that is transmitted throughout the body and that almost gives the feeling of fainting. It is overcome by always being in the company of someone, as it must be stealthy and cannot leave traces. During submission attempts, every thought, everything read and seen, and every memory will be used as a weapon against you.        On some occasions it may go so far as to tell you to give him your soul, that is, to perform the following ritual: to write explicitly your intention on a sheet of paper, to bring blood out of your body and sign with it. As a final act burn the sheet (which is absolutely to be avoided as then you do not go back).      Their followers to get any kind of role in hell must sacrifice everything they have in life and kill someone, better if someone they care about or some complete stranger and as a final gesture themselves.  Demons cannot bring anything out and it must be the adept who performs certain rituals to learn new things and improve level, but at each of these acts their lives are ruined more and more. Hell consists of 9 levels.  The souls of people who commit suicide are struck by the eyes little by little until they get their eyes ripped, a process that lasts years and they have to turn 15 turns before they can be saved.",

  "Hatchets of regret caress my lousy head  When yellow rains wet my stinky bed.  Rivers of urine drown vile neighbours.  Die, motherf…ers! My lovely haters  Call cops when I dive into nu metal.  Collect fingers. The ear is my medal.  Lyrically, I blast minds. Maniacs fear me  When I sharpen rusty spoons jeeringly.  Don’t kindle my anger! Don’t shake peace!  Don’t awake inner storms! Hunger gees  Me up when laziness hobbles my will.  Armies of despair trample the green hill  Of optimism. Ambitions look for a new heart.  Mine is like an empty grave. Envy is a dart  That pricks my ill feelings. Books lie.  Happiness is like idleness flavoured by  Dangerous liquids. I suck nipples of clouds  That lack clean water. Peevish guilt shouts  At shadows of my past. The war is not a threat.  My spirit is already dead! I challenge dread  To the battle of deviations. Hatchets of regret  Comb my hairy brain. I make worlds sweat!    © Aslan MacPoetry, 2022.",

  "Hog Rider \"Having tamed the fierce leaping hog, the Hog Rider punishes those who hide behind their puny walls! Fueled by Dark Elixir, these warriors have never known defeat!\" Summary The Hog Rider is a fast ground troop with medium hitpoints, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy Walls. He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks. The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer. He has a mohawk, wears a brown leather loincloth, a red belt, and a pair of leather sandals, as well as two large golden wristbands and a gold earring. His ride is a large hog, about half his height. It has a brown leather bridle looped around its tusks, which in turn is held by the Hog Rider. Hog Riders prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden and the activated Town Hall weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings. Once all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby. Strategy Offensive He can be used to jump over any level Walls, rendering them ineffective against Hog Riders. Note that while this allows Hog Riders free access to what lies behind the Walls, it does not open up gaps for other troops to move through. If the Hog Riders need the support of other ground troops, you will still need to deploy Wall Breakers, a Jump Spell, or Earthquake Spells in order to assist them. Hog Riders can be used en masse, i.e. a \"Hog Rider Rush\", without requiring any Wall Breakers to break Walls. However, such a strategy can be costly in terms of Dark Elixir, and sports weaknesses against defending Clan Castle troops, Heroes, Giant Bombs, and Skeleton Traps, a problem which only becomes more prominent at higher levels. At Town Hall 10 and above, Hog Riders can be combined with Miners in a strategy known as Hog Miner or Hybrid. Both troops are able to bypass Walls innately, but Miners do not have a preferential target, allowing them to cover for Hog Riders by dealing with defending Heroes and Skeleton Traps. The combination also has weaknesses against flying Clan Castle troops, as neither are able to target air. At lower levels, Hog Riders are quite capable of acting as distracting troops like Giants; they have nearly as much health as a similar-level Giant, move twice as fast, and do considerably more damage. They work well with the Healing Spell when you group several of them together. A good tactic for using Healing Spells is to place them strategically on a cluster of defenses (at least about 3 or more) and also deploy them shortly before the Hog Riders arrive in the area, i.e. deploy them ahead of the Hog Riders. This is so that the Hog Riders get the most out of the Healing Spell, and destroy the defenses without losing too much HP. Spots where Giant Bombs or Bomb Towers are/may be should be given special attention when deploying Healing Spells. Hogs of the same level as the Giant Bomb will survive a single Giant Bomb, but they\u0027re helpless against a pair of Giant Bombs even with a Healing Spell. Heal them after they\u0027ve gone through a Giant Bomb blast. The Hog Rider is one of the best troop types for drawing out Clan Castle troops, as it can avoid Walls to penetrate deep enough to reach centrally-placed Clan Castles (and enough health to not die before it gets there). Deploy one or a few to trigger the Clan Castle troops, then lure the reinforcement troops to the corner side, and deploy multiple Archers or Wizards to slaughter them, and then deploy the remainder of your Hog Riders. This strategy is especially effective during Clan War raids. However, Skeletons from the Skeleton Trap and Heroes can also easily kill the Hog Riders, as they can only target defenses, so make sure to have some troops that target anything, such as Wizards, which can swipe out the Skeletons. Hog Riders don\u0027t target air so flying Clan Castle troops, especially Dragons, can be a big threat. Most mass Hog Rider strategies in Clan Wars require that the Clan Castle troops be killed first by luring. Bring other troops in addition to Hog Riders, such as Wizards, to deal with enemy Clan Castle troops and clean up the base. Poison Spells can be used to kill almost any enemy Clan Castle troop, but beware as the troops will attempt to flee the poison. If the Poison Spells are decently leveled, and you effectively keep the Clan Castle troops from escaping the Poison Spell with distracting troops, they can eliminate almost any troop. They can also be used to dispense of those pesky Skeletons risen from the Skeleton Traps. Time is also a factor to consider. With only 3 minutes in an attack, it is essential to make sure that this whole process and the remainder of the attack is done as quickly as possible to avoid running out of time. Defensive Defending against Hog Riders is tricky, as their ability to bypass Walls renders them irrelevant. However, the fact that they can jump over Walls and attack defenses means that they may leave behind their ground support (such as Barbarians, etc.), as they will not be able to follow. This will allow your interior defenses to concentrate on the Hog Riders. Another way to defend against Hog Riders is to exploit the fact that they will attack the closest defensive building. You can arrange your base in such a way so that you have high-powered defenses on the inside and lower-powered defense on the outside, with a layer of resources in between. That way, the Hogs will (in theory) complete a loop around your base before being able to attack your interior defenses (Inferno Towers, X-Bows, etc.), by which time they should have all been killed by the interior defenses. You can place Spring Traps and Giant Bombs in between defensive buildings to take out a few Hog Riders at a time; good usage of multiple Spring Traps and Giant Bombs can severely hinder a Hog Rider rush. Hog Riders can be easily killed using \"forced pathing\". Forced pathing is a strategy that manipulates the Hog Rider AI and makes them go to at least 2 defenses that cannot be prevented by surgical dropping or side clearing. Placing a set of Giant Bombs in between the two can most certainly hinder the attacker progress. They would not be able to heal the Hog Riders in time. Clan Castle troops, Heroes, and Skeleton Traps set to Ground Mode can be an annoyance to mass Hog Rider raids, as Hog Riders will not attack them unless all defenses have been destroyed. Make sure to centralize them if you want to beat Hog Riders. In Clan Wars, Dragons are excellent troops to place in Clan Castles against Hog Riders, especially for Town Halls 8 and 9. They have high HP, meaning they won\u0027t die easily and can kill mass quantities of Hog Riders swiftly if not properly lured. Most mass Hog Rider strategies require that the enemy Clan Castle troops be killed first, so if the attacker lures out a Dragon, but fails to kill it, then a 3-star win is next to impossible, much less a 1-star win via destroying 50% of the buildings. Multi-target Inferno Towers can be a severe hindrance to Hog Riders, having high HP to take several hits",

Now, Ni**as is not a real word as you can\u0027t pronounce asteriscks, but hear me out. What if they are a substitution for another letter? Since they are both asterisks, we can assume they are the same letter like in algebra. I have narrowed down the possibilities down to Q, G, K and C using phonetics analysis. Now, if we replace the asterisks with one of those letters, we should get our answer. Niqqas, Nikkas and Niccas aren\u0027t proper english words, but",

  "The Gospel ¨For God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.¨ John 3:16 ¨For i delivered to you first of all that which i also received: how Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, was buried, rose again the third day according to the scriptures,¨  1 Corinthians 15:3-4 ¨Jesus answered, ¨Truly, truly I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.¨  John 3:5 ¨that if you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God has raised from the dead, you will be saved,¨ Romans 10:9 The story: God loved the world(us) so much that He gave His one and only Son to die in our place. If you ever feel like you\u0027re not loved, remember the creator of the universe sent His Son to die in your place regardless if you believe in him or not! ¨Why did Jesus have to die?¨ Because all of God\u0027s creation has rebelled against Him at some point, Yes! Even You and I. When God created everything in existence, He looked at it and said ¨It is Good.¨ Well I think we can all agree humanity as a whole is not good! We were made in the image of God yet as whole we are not good. We kill, steal, lie, commit crimes, ignore the needy, don´t obey our parents, we break the laws, and humanity as a whole has done every sort of evil under the sun. ¨Well I\u0027m a good person!¨ To who´s standard? You have done at least one thing on the list above. Can you comfortably say lying is a trait of being a good person? What about stealing? You can say that but that would make you a liar and that would only prove my point. God creates the standard of good not us! His standard of good is perfect and none of us are perfect. Don´t let the arrogant ¨Christians¨ in church fool you either. They also are not perfect and need Jesus just as much as You and I. ¨So wait, why did Jesus have to die?¨ The answer is sin. We have all sinned and fell short of the glory of God. According to word, all of us will die someday and we will have to be face to face with God and give an account of everything we have ever done in our lives, good or bad. Your next question may be ¨does God know everything we have ever done?¨ The answer is yes, He is all knowing and Has a book of everything little thing you have ever done in your life and you will be judged off what you have done. Imagine this, you have to go to court to prove your innocence. You´re on trial and God is the judge. God will call your name and go through your book. He is going to ask why have you gone against him with the way you live and then ask if you think you really deserve to go to heaven. At this point any person would be terrified and speechless. How can we tell a perfect, Holy and all knowing God we deserve to go to heaven? We can´t! The bible says the wages of sin is death! In other words, one sin is enough to say you don\u0027t deserve to go to heaven. Wages means ¨something we have earned¨ when you work, your wages are a paycheck. When you sin, your wages are death. But the good news is if we place our trust in Jesus He acts as our lawyer. The Bible says he has the ability to blot out our sins! He can go in our book and remove anything that would keep us from going to heaven. How does that work exactly? Again the Bible says the wages of sin is death! Meaning for every sin something or someone has to die. Jesus came and died on the cross in our place. He took the punishment for us! He basically went into court and paid our fines so the judge could legally let us go. Jesus paid a price we could never afford.  So Where is Jesus now? He is in heaven! God is a just and good father. He would never send his child to hell. Want to hear the greatest news in the history of the world? ¨But to all who believed in him and accepted him, He gave the right to become children of God. They are reborn-not with a physical birth resulting from human passion or plan, but a birth that comes from God.¨ John 1:12-13 You can become a child of God! How do you do that? You have to believe in Jesus and His good news! What is the good news? The Gospel literally means the good news. This is the gospel: ¨I passed on to you what was most important and what had also passed on to me. 1.) Christ died for our sins, just as the scriptures said. 2.) He was buried, and 3.) He was raised on the third day, just as the Scriptures said.¨ 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 ¨Based on this how can I go to heaven?¨ ¨If you \u003copenly declare\u003e that Jesus is Lord and 2.) believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved For it is believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved. As the Scriptures tell us, ¨Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.¨ Romans 10:9-11 Jesus calls all men everywhere to repent(forsake sin).       Although God overlooked the periods of ignorance, now He commands everyone everywhere to repent. Acts 17:30.  But if the wicked turns from all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all My laws and does what is lawful and right, he will surely live, he will not die. Ezekiel 18:21 It\u0027s not just a confession of sins but a change of action. Without repentance we will not inherit the kingdom of God. Peter said to them, “Repent, and let each of you be immersed in the name of Messiah Yeshua for the removal of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Ruach ha-Kodesh. Acts 2:38      One who covers up his transgressions will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them finds mercy. Proverbs 28:13.  Following Jesus isn\u0027t just a one time thing or a prayer; it\u0027s a relationship with him until the very end.       But the one who endures to the end will be saved. Matthew 24:13.  If you are reading this all of this he is calling you to repentance he doesn\u0027t want you or anyone to perish but that all may be saved choose today whom you will serve.        For He says, “At a favorable time I listened to you, in a day of salvation I helped you.” Behold, now is the favorable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation. 2 Corinthians 6:2 To those who truly repent(turn from sins) and believe in Jesus/Yeshua you will be gifted the holy spirit which will give you the power to obey and God\u0027s laws will be written on your heart.       “This is the covenant that I will cut with them: ‘After those days,’ says Adonai , ‘I will put My Torah upon their hearts, and upon their minds I will write it,’” then He says,“I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.” Now where there is removal of these, there is no longer an offering for sin. Hebrews 10:16‭-‬18  Whatever we have done it can be forgiven only through the blood of messiah      for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the removal of sins. Matthew 26:28  God also gives us power over sin to not just to forgive us and save us. For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, training us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live in a manner that is self-controlled and righteous and godly in the present age. Titus 2:11‭-‬12  If you need prayers or have questions I\u0027d loved to help just email me at this account. If you need teaching checkout bethyeshuainternational.org Shalom",

  "ALMOSST EVERY RAPPER FROM THE 90\u0027S WAS AND IS IF THEY STILL HERE BETTER THAN JAY-Z PERIOD CUZ HE ALWAYS SUCKED EVER SINCE I HEARRD HIS FIRST SHIAT BUT HE WAS GOOD THOUGH AT ONE POINT BACK IN THE DAY BUT NOT THE BEST AND THERE AINT NO ONE BEST EVER, AND NEVER WILL BE AT RAP, CONGRATS THOUGH AND PEACE...I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS WAY SHITTIER RAPPERS THAN YOU THEN, BUT WHEN HE WAS RAPPIN LIKE BIG L KINDA PISSED ME OFF, THAT BIG L GOT KILLED BECUASE ITS LIKE WTF IS THAT, A SACRIFICE? AND THEN HE EXPLODED FINANCIALLY... LIFE IS SHORT AND HE THINKS HE KNOWS WHAT THE TRUTH IS BUT HES GONNA GET A KICK IN THE BUTT WHEN HE STANDS AND WATCHES HIS LIFE GO BY AND GET JUGDED LIKE WE ALL WILL, BUT JUST ASK YO SELF WAS IT WORTH IT? TAKING THE SIDE AGAINST yESHUA/cHRIST?.... WE IN END TIMES AND AINT NO MONEY GONNA SAVE U HOMIE, BUT STUDY MORE, AND FINISH THE PUZZLE THAT WILL SHOW U THE TRUTH, THEN U REALIZE THINGS U WONT BELIEVE, MATERIALISM IS JUST LIKE GARBAGE IN YOUR GARBAGE  CAN, WHEN YOU FIND THE TRUTH. YOU GREW WITH THE WRONG DUDE FOOL!!!..I LOVE MUSIC, AND I MAKE MUSIC, AND IT KEEPS ME FIANCIALLY HAPPY BUT IF I EVER HAD TO SACRIFICE ANYTHHHHHHHHHING THATS LIVING FOR MORE MATERIALISTIC CRAP I WOULD NEVER EVER EVEN THINK TWICE TO SAY NO, IF GOD BLESSED ME WITH W/E MONEY AND POWER/FAME I WOULD PRAY 24/7 FOR HIM TO MAKE SURE I BRIING GLORY TO THE LORD WITH IT AND NOT BUY SO MUCH MATERIALISTIC STUFF I DONT NEEED , I MEAN ONE OF YOUR WATCHES CAN FEED AND SAVE SO MANY CHILDREN....I PRAY FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY BECUSE WE DONT HAVE MUCH TIME ON THIS EARTH BEFORE THE END TIMES AND SECOND COMING OF YEHUA/JESUS HAPEENS....YOU STILL GOT TIME TO FIND THE TRUTH... I KNOW WHAT YALL DO BEHIND THE SCENES THAT WOULD PROLLY MAKE YOU LOSE A LOT OF FANS THESE DAYS BUT NOT ALL BUT IF THEY FOUND OUT IN THE 90\u0027S YOU WOULD HAVE NOBODY AS A FAN, THATS BECAUSE WE ARE LIVING CLOSE TO THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST, CROWLY WAS MENTAL, SICK, ILL, AND POSSESSED, BUT YOU ADMIRE HIM WHICH IS SCARY THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU DO...TECHNOLOGY IS NOT GONNA SAVE YOU EVEN IF WE HAD MORE TIME BECASUE THE LORD KNOWS IT COMES FROM LUCIFER AND IT STARTED WITH A BITE OF AN APPLE FROM A FORBIDDEN TREE, THE ELTES KNOW ITS ALL TRUE AND THEY KNOW the fallen are real the followed lucifer, but the fallen are very much out powered and outnumbered, i understand why the lord cant kill lucifer because he created him and he was once the greatest angel but he did not want to love the lords creations who were below him in a lower dimension, so eventually he realized how perfect he was that he wanted to take gods throne but that was not a very good move for him and also for us humans, because now god had to out himself in a human body to beat death live life tempted throughout it all and at his suffering times the holy spirit had to leave him so he can be tempted and still not sin and die to pay the debt of death the devil brought upon his creation. You all are still loved unconditionally by the Lord and his light that has such a radiation of love you cant even possibly imagine , there will be a new heaven and a second death but also there will be a second chance to accept Yeshua/Jesus as the son of God Lord all mighty, believe it or not its up to you but every scripture prophecy has so far come true to date. I am sinner daily and i still love the lord in the name of his begotten son that died for our sins, even though i still think im not worthy enough to even speak about him but i know in my heart he is the truth and i would give the world up for him.....it is only a matter of time and everyone will hear and see the true messiah afterr the false antichrist loses his power, ALL GLORY TO YESHUA AND THE TRUE LORD AND CREATOR, WE MUST PRAY FOR EACHOTHER AND FORGIVE AND LOVE ONE ANOTHER IF YOU WANT TO HAVE ETERNAL LIFE BUT ONLY THROUGH THE FATHER SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT. I DO NOT BELONG TO NO RELIGION BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER BY DARKNESS OF THE FALLEN SO I AM A MAN OF GOD IN THE NAME OF YESHUA AKA JESUS, BUT I STILL SIN AND AS WE AL STILL SIN WE STILL HAVE THE FREE GIFT OF ETERNAL LIFE, JUST SPREAD THE SEEDS OF THE GOSPELS AND SCIPTURES TO THE PEOPLE AT THE RIGHT TIME YOU THINK CONFLICT WONT START, THERE IS ALWAYS THE RIGHT TIME TO SPREAD A HOLY SEED TO SOMEONE ELSE. FORGIVE ME FATHER FOR I AM SINNING EVERYDAY AND I FIRST CANT EVEN FORGIVE MYSELF OR ASK FOR FORGIVENESS TO THE ONES I HURT BUT I WILL IF I EVER GET THE CHANCE , BUT ASKING YOU FOR FORGIVENESS IS EVEN HARDER FOF THE SINNING I DO, FORGIVE US ALL IN THE NAME OF YOUR BEGOTTEN SON THAT DIED FOR OUR SINS. i shed a tear if not many more a day for the lord and his pain we cause him without knowing.",

  "But here’s what’s actually down-most black people mind, and if they don’t, there’s something wrong. Either they have become less-resistant due to fear of confrontation, or they are less aware of the true terror that exists for being a black person. Racism is very systematic and VERY hidden in today’s world. The news covers only a grain of sand of police brutality accounts compared to the beaches of police brutality that actually happens on a daily basis. People judge us based off of our culture, or hair texture, and, get this, our skin color. They look at us as animals, degenerates, mean, angry, loud, raunchy, dumb, lesser than, more susceptible to illness and disease and viruses, etc. using the N word is extremely offensive and insensitive to the struggles that are specific to those of African descent and are black. It is used among our race to express a sense of company in not going alone through racially demeaning, belittling, and derogatory views specifically against blacks. If you, your father, mother, children, sisters, grandparents, great-grandparents, etc. would/have not been called this slur/have not been targeted by police as the most oppressed race in the face of police brutality/racism-do not claim it as if you’re in on it, too. We use the term sarcastically, and almost as a mocking of such a harmful, demonizing word. It is only sarcastic if it is coming from a fellow black person. If it comes from a non-black person, it does not express a sense of companionship or historical brotherhood in the sense of black oppression.  I’m not trying to “pop-off”, and I am not mad. I just hope that people hear this from someone *cough* me *cough* who is actually fully black and has experienced and have had all of my family members experience some level of racism. I only hope to enlighten you so that you can take away a sense of sympathy, NOT empathy, and knowledge so that this issue does not become perpetual. It is so hurtful that I see the word becoming popular among non-black races, and that there is so little regard for the history behind the word. Whites tend to see it as a means of establishing friendship and closeness to someone, and that’s it. Understandably so-they have no history of their own race to relate to this. It is so much more, and it is not simply a alternative to “buddy”, or “dude”. The more this word is used-the more hopeless blacks feel toward any social progress or respect from non-blacks. We become silent and fine, because there are so many pressures to fit in with non-blacks, to not see “Malcom X-y”. We already feel powerless in a nation run by those who deem themselves superior to us. After a while it almost seems pointless to speak out against ignorant and disregard at all.",

  "I hope y’all know all that crap about the Illuminati is not real lol. The Illuminati wasn’t a group that sold their soul for power or fame it was actually a secret society of ppl who understood the law of attraction \u0026 manifesting. It had nothing to do with satanic crap. Basically we live in a world where everything has a reason for existence. Atoms make up the whole universe. It was all about physics \u0026 how to manifest any desire. \u0026 that was literally years ago. It’s just ironic they r throwing up diamond symbols (aka which ppl think is a triangle lol) bc it represents Roc-a-fella records. It’s not a pyramid it’s a freaking diamond bc the label has been around since 1996 \u0026 the symbol of the diamond is used to acknowledge the success they had. Plus the diamond is the hardest rock in the world. The crowd is just lit. Nothing satanic. You guys see “symbols” \u0026 all that \u0026 say “omg they r evil omg.” That’s y we’re never gonna see the aliens bc ppl believe anything \u0026 u guys are such scaredy-cats like my goodness! Government ain’t telling us Sh!t \u0026 they’ll continue to create fake news like COVID. They faked a lot of the deaths. Ik ppl who died from other reasons \u0026 they just wrote it as Covid. Obviously ppl did die from it \u0026 I don’t want to be insensitive, but mostly it was dangerous for like older ppl or ppl with weak immune systems or one who is obese. Think about about it!They said it would be hard for them to have a vaccine, but the vaccine wasn’t that hard to create bc a doctor created a vaccine themselves \u0026 no one believed her until now oh wow there’s a vaccine made that fast. It wasn’t as dangerous as what they made it out to be. Idk wtf the government tryna do bc supposedly it’s only for 16 \u0026 older. Idk it’s sus! Be realistic \u0026 stay woke!!",

  "The evolution of dark skin is believed to have begun around 1.2 million years ago, in light-skinned early hominid species after they moved from the equatorial rainforest to the sunny savannas. In the heat of the savannas, better cooling mechanisms were required, which were achieved through the loss of body hair and development of more efficient perspiration. The loss of body hair led to the development of dark skin pigmentation, which acted as a mechanism of natural selection against folate depletion, and to a lesser extent, DNA damage. The primary factor contributing to the evolution of dark skin pigmentation was the breakdown of folate in reaction to ultraviolet radiation; the relationship between folate breakdown induced by ultraviolet radiation and reduced fitness as a failure of normal embryogenesis and spermatogenesis led to the selection of dark skin pigmentation. By the time modern Homo sapiens evolved, all humans were dark-skinned, and some of these people were the ones in Paris.",

  "JESUS HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED, ACCEPT HIM AS YOUR PERSONAL LORD AND SAVIOIR BEFORE IT\u0027S TOO LATE!  I want to tell you all my brother\u0027s and sisters, our time is coming and so is the devil\u0027s, the great dragon, the evil serpent who is called the devil and satan. You must choose who you will serve, god\u0027s grace and mercy is given to us freely and best of all, his salvation to eternal life, his love beyond anything is one of the greatest feelings. The satan only offers death and pain, the bible says the only thing he comes to do is to kill, steal and destroy.  Don\u0027t let him destroy your relationship with Jesus Christ, don\u0027t let him distract you and steal your salvation because he lost his, don\u0027t let him kill you and send you to the lake of fire where he will be once Jesus returns.  I tell you, I have found refuge and shelter in God, he has guided me and saved me countless of times and I thank him so much for that. He has given me the choice to love and serve him or be with the world. I found that I cannot save myself, I cannot find love and happiness in myself, Jesus has given it all to me, through him and by him have I found rest, peace, love and a relationship worth more than anything in this world. To know Jesus and accept him into your heart and your life is the best thing anyone can do, it\u0027s best decision I have made and satan is scared of this.  This is what satan is scared of, that you know you have someone who loves you, protects you and gives you eternal life, satan wants you in the same place he is and that\u0027s hell, he wants you to join him in torture of your sins, to burn and hate forever. ONLY THROUGH JESUS CHRIST WILL YOU FIND SALVATION AND ETERNAL LIFE  Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV ⁸For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: ⁹Not of works, lest any man should boast.  John 3:16 ¹⁶For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Loving and serving our father is a choice and I pray that you receive him in the name of Jesus Christ, there is no works that you must do to be saved, say this prayer and receive Jesus into your life, you will see your whole life change before your eyes  \"Father forgive me for I am a sinner and I have sinned, I am so sorry for the sins I have said and done (confess all known and unknown sins). I am in need of a saviour, I believe that you are the only begotten son of God, I believe that you were crucified and have died for my sins and everyone\u0027s sins, I believe that you rose on the third day, I accept you as my personal lord and saviour, please come into my heart and give me a new one, I put my whole faith and trust in you alone. Amen.  As soon as you receive him you are saved.  Jesus wants everyone to be saved and it is our free will and I don\u0027t want anyone to go to hell neither does Jesus, when you have Jesus in your life, nothing is impossible.  God bless all.",

  "Let me take this opportunity to show my gratitude towards this wonderful woman,I was working in a receptionist and met my husband who was a manager at the time we dated for a year and a half before getting married. After about 6 months of marriage he came to me one day and told me he wanted the separation. I knew I was fighting a little more than usual, but it was no reason for the separation, at least not in my eyes. I tried to reason with him to find out if it was real. He was serious and kept his position. He packed up and left our house. I still thought it was something that would pass until I found out through a mutual friend that there was another woman who was interested in him. I immediately began to ask him questions about what was really happening and tried to reason with him. It turned out that he said he had feelings for this lady and was confused. After a month of trying to solve the things he told me he wanted a divorce. I was devastated and broken. I went to different prophets and traditional healers to get help but all failed until A friend recommended me to this Woman of God called Mama Anna +27782391426. I sent her a whats app message and she replied instantly, i told her about my situation and she told me not to worry that she can handle it.The lady did the job. He came to me about within 24 hours after the spell had been done and told me that he was a fool and did not want a divorce. We are now happily married and my man is under my husband is under my control. Mama also prayed for our business which was not doing well and we are now financially stable and healthy. I thank God to have led me to Mama, we are really happy and any one with difficulties in life, contact her on +27782391426",

  "PAUSE @ 2:35-ish and say hello to baphomet? ...even with a capital letter, \"Baphomet\" remains misspelled.  hmmm... wiki says:  Baphomet is a deity that the Knights Templar were accused of worshipping,[4] and that subsequently was incorporated into occult and mystical traditions. The name Baphomet appeared in trial transcripts for the Inquisition of the Knights Templar starting in 1307.[5] It first came into popular English usage in the 19th century during debate and speculation on the reasons for the suppression of the Templars.[6] Since 1856, the name Baphomet has been associated with the \"Sabbatic Goat\" image drawn by Éliphas Lévi,[1][2][7] which contains binary elements representing the \"symbolization of the equilibrium of opposites\"[1] (e.g. half-human and half-animal, male and female, good and evil, on and off, etc.).[1][2] On one hand, Lévi\u0027s intention was to symbolize his concept of balance that was essential to his magnetistic notion of the Astral Light;[1][2] on the other hand, the Baphomet represents a tradition that should result in a perfect social order.[1][2]",

  "Hold on, let me defend Kanye cause I don\u0027t think nobody understands where this man is coming from. • Kanye said Harriet Tubman didn\u0027t free the slaves. Last time I checked, Harriet Tubman took slaves from the south and led them north. When they got to Detroit, Chicago, New York, etc they ALL took jobs working for white men. If they were free, why didn\u0027t they create opportunity for themselves in the form of their own marketplace or political party. A community in which the members protect each other\u0027s interest and doesn\u0027t allow outside influence change their behavior. Also, to this day, 99% of the world is enslaved in some form or fashion. Sorry but it\u0027s true.  • When Kanye told the story of how he found out Kim was pregnant, it let me know this man was not joking. He really looked at Kim the way we do! We know she a little bust down baddie with a sex tape and earning potential galore. (Shout out to Ray J for putting that WHOLE family on.) But he brought the story up because he was explaining to people that even though he is wealthy and has means to take care of his potential child, his ego didn\u0027t wanna take the hit of getting her pregnant. Come on man, imagine how you would feel if you were dating a bitch we all seen get fucked, and she get pregnant! And you hit it raw so you hoping she ain\u0027t calling about getting tested lol. Stop playing. I would\u0027ve been like \"bitch you goin to get that quick procedure.\" When God fucked up his laptop in that story, Kanye KNEW it immediately and repented. Kim protected North. Facts.  •Bill Cosby got set up by NBC because he tried to buy NBC. When his purchase was denied, he decided to launch a new network and those Jesuits ain\u0027t goin for that.  • His proposal fro Plan A is genius! 1 million dollars in assistance for mothers. 50K a year for 20 years! Are y\u0027all that stupid yall don\u0027t understand that this man is saying he wants to preserve life because every human brought into the world can be the next Steve Jobs! A lot of young women get abortions because they are forced into it by their circumstances. Women, by nature, are designed to protect life and preserve it by any means. Example, two 19 year old girls are both pregnant. They both live with their respective families compromised of one mother and one dad. Girl A, has great parents that support her and are able to help her support the child. Girl B, has parents that are verbally abusive towards her and are already struggling financially. Which girl is more likely to get an abortion? Kanye is saying that Girl B should have support regardless! Plan A! He wasn\u0027t saying anything other than that. We men know that abortion is perfectly fine when the woman is a victim of sexual abuse. Also not all victims of sexual abuse choose to terminate pregnancy. THAT SHIT TOOK FOREVER TO TYPE.",

  "He is part of the Illuminati confirmed. Religion is a scam. Social media is a distraction. Money is as well. The government controls us, but the Illuminati controls the government. And the Illuminati is controlled by Lucifer... But, the Illuminati also killed 2pac. Killuminti 7 day theory. Guy watching 2pac jump a southside crip at the mike Tyson fight with a triangle on his back. Camera then turns away from the guys view and the fight scene fast. ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED. THESE MUHFUCKERS KILLED 2PAC. Kanye also said it in a song niggas in Paris by jay z. When you reverse it. He also puts we love hip hop with it so you hear one of the two. Jay z had beef with Tupac back then and made a song called dead or alive which was written before his death but released after. Explained how his death was going to go down and how 4 gunshots were going to take him down and end his life. Kanye also says in a song that he sold his soul. And it’s actual lyrics. ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED. Michael Jackson also tried warning his fans before he died that they need to wake up and tried to tell them what he meant but didn’t say straight forward because anyone who does say what they believe is said to be a psycho. But back then when people talk about the world not being revolved around instead revolving around the sun were also said to be psychos but then proven to be correct. In the end once this is proven true and people finally understand it will maybe be too late. Also, dollar bill has the triangle. The letters on the bottom of the triangle that is on the triangle create a pattern like 666. But, it’s also used to create the date 1776. Which is the year of the declaration. Illuminati confirmed. The triangle gives it away. That’s their symbol after all.",

  "I think Kanye West is the goat and here\u0027s why: In my opinion to be the goat you need at least 3 classics All other albums have to be great ( I\u0027ll allow 1 or 2 mediocre album but no trash albums) You must have influenced a great younger artist. Kanye meets all those requirements and then sum. Kanye has not 3 but 4 classics( the college dropout, late registration, graduation, and my beautiful dark twisted fantasy) Every other album is great except for 808s and heartbreaks which is a failed experimental album even though it has some great tracks. Last but not least Kanye inspired Travis Scott who is a great artist with his own vibe going for him. If you think anyone else matches that criteria please comment I would like to hear your opinions and might discover some new artist.",

I understand it\u0027s all about context when using racial terms but in doing this you are walking on a very thin sheet of ice, I can see this causing several altercations where african-americans or other blacks take offence through misunderstanding. I don\u0027t believe in racism, we are the human race and you can\u0027t be racist to your own species, this would be what I call ethnicityism if anything, I have said nigga in front of a few of my past black friends (I say past as I no longer have contact with a few of them) and even called them a nigga but in a friendly way and no offence was taken, I did ask beforehand on their thoughts about using racial terms though, I used to have a black friend called David who would call me snowman but I took no offence to it at all. If you are going to say the word just don\u0027t go around saying in front of people you don\u0027t know, if I caught you trying to insult a black person (or any other ethnicity for that matter) based on their physical appearance, a swift jab to the nose would be in order.",

If 17-13 is 4 that means its a hidden code , lets dig deeper , the wourd four has four letters , hmmm , is that what he was hiding all theese years ? he had a huge ego just to blend in the code so we wouldn\u0027t figure out ? YOUR\u0027E WRONG ! illuminati is the third eye, third has 5 letters , 5+4\u003d9 , 9 is also the number of pussy i got yesterdaY , what does that have to do with kanye you may ask , let me explain, after this song he got 6 pussy when he was offerd over nine thousand , is this another hidden code ? lets see! pussy cat has 8 letters , if i have 9 pussys and kanye has 6 that means , 9-6+8 \u003d11  , but WAIT! if we add 9 to 6 its 69 , seems suspicious? 69 is the number that represents sex , did kanye get 6 pussys just so he can make me look like a virgin because no\u0027one knew that yet? now we all know im a virgin , and 9-6 is 3, illuminati has 3 sides, kanye illuminat confirmed , i am a virgin confirmed , atleast now we all know how was responsible for the terrorist attack.",

  "After listening to just a couple of rappers/hip-hop artists, I discovered that those vast majority used derogatory language against women and races which just happened to be their own race. One particular song I found interesting was a song by Jay-Z and Kanye West which was called “Ni**gas in Paris.” After listening to the lyrics of this song, I was very surprised that it even sold not just because of the words but the title itself. In my opinion, I do think young kids are influenced by music. The reason I say this is because the age and generation of parents today. The average age of parents of today is quite different of the ages of parents when I was coming up. Today we have mothers and fathers of kids that are not even twenty and those are the types of music they listen to, so of course that’s what the child is accustomed to. I do not think that artists such as these two should be viewed as role models for the simple fact of the negative message they are sending but instead artists who sends out positive messages without the profanity and the name-calling. I also think that the biggest role models can be the parents who screen what their children are watching and listening to. Perhaps if more parents start being better examples of what right looks like then maybe the artists will start setting a better example. I tend to look at it like a cycle; the artists are seeing what goes on in everyday life, that’s what they are producing and that’s what the kids see. The cycle has to be broken. Many people may ask, “Why only the negative are certain artists producing?”  It’s simple, because that is what sells and to take it a step further, the ones doing the negativity are the ones buying what’s being produced. That’s the cycle!",

Unless of course we\u0027re talking about organizations that claim to have ties to Illuminati and are trying to gain power to establish a new world order by controlling world affairs, in which case... yet that can be a really bad thing and scary to think there are people working from the shadows to mastermind events and such.

You think that there exists a hyper powerful super-organisation controlling everything from the shadows, throughout history influencing every major political, social and economic decision, pulling the governments strings. This organisation, the Illuminati, is responsible for putting people in power who will do what they say, for basically validating every conspiracy nut of all time and for being the single most dangerous and intelligent organisation of all time. And you think, this collection of the greatest, most cunning minds of our age, they put references to their power and existence in popular music videos and bank notes???

  "Hellsing77472 horas atrás   + Lucas Vittoz Concordo com você é homem! Ao lado de parte de Paris \"! PARIS PARA A MÃE DO CARALHO WIN melhor cidade na França por FAR: p (eu sou parisiense e Preto, apenas dizendo!) Mas eu sei que o racismo existe França, assim como a maioria dos países ocidentais. O preconceito racial e racismo são diferentes de país para país. E se as pessoas pensam que a América não é um país racista que significa que vocês estão pirando mudo. E pelo jeito pode algo que um americano pode considerar racista não ser considerado racista no meu país e vice-versa. É por isso que, como a pessoa francês eu acho que é muito racista de chamar o grupo de minorias diferente, algo + americano. Como afro-americana, mexicana americana e assim por diante e assim por diante. Mas quando se trata de pessoas brancas, adivinhem? As pessoas simplesmente chamá-los americano. É mesmo? Não é um pouco estranho? Para mim, como um estranho e eu não me importo o que alguém diz, isso significa apenas que a única maneira de ser \"americano\" é ser branco. Porque, aparentemente, ser branco é um clube exclusivo, onde você tem que ter dois pais brancos que ser branco e manter a raça \"pura\". Mas quando é a outra raça que é bom, você só precisa ter um pai negro a ser preto ou apenas um dos pais asiático a ser asiático. Porque você e eu sabemos que os brancos nunca jamais reconhecer mistura de raça pessoas fazem parte da raça branca. E porque o mundo é governado por pessoas brancas a maioria das pessoas do mundo têm essa mentalidade. Minorias incluído. Não há muito tempo, eu costumava pensar que se você estivesse corrida mix (branco + outra coisa) você era apenas outra parte da mistura (por isso, basicamente, a outra coisa). Mas isso é outro assunto. De qualquer forma, meu ponto é que ninguém chamar um branco americano \"euro-americana\", mas apenas americano. E isso só dividir o país entre as raças. Você tem o americano e os outros que é algo + americano. Porque vamos ser honestos, neste mundo, quando você é branco você é \"normal\". Infelizmente, é a maneira que é. Ninguém coisa que as pessoas brancas têm um pequeno nariz ou lábios pequenos, porque eles são apenas normal. Porque ser branco é apenas ser normal. Mas quando você é preto, tem gente que acha que tem o cabelo estranho (não me faça começar com isso), nariz grande e uma boca grande. Mas você sabe por que as pessoas acham que sobre nós? É porque, mesmo sem perceber, eles nos comparar com pessoas brancas. E se fosse o contrário, se o mundo era governado por pessoas negras, eu tenho certeza que hoje a maioria de nós acha que os brancos nariz e boca e muito pequeno e anormal e que as pessoas mix raça (preto e branco / outros) não são negros, mas parte da outra raça. De qualquer forma, o racismo é coxo, mas não é algo sobre ser branco, preto, asiático e assim por diante e assim por diante, é só NATUREZA HUMANA PORRA. E isso não presta! Aconteceu que a cor da pele é mais visível do que o tipo de sangue. Mas isso não é desculpa para o racismo em todas as maneiras.",

Human ability and knowledge can be godlike and magnificent if it weren\u0027t for people such as you and religious followers. We are all capable of great things. Religion strips you away from realizing that. God does not determine your fate, you do. There is no God, there never was. It\u0027s time to grow up as humans and literally, WAKE THE FUCK UP.",
  "Oh wow. Ok first of all, the Egyptian pyramids were massive tombs for their emperors. The masonic eye inside the pyramid is what I guess what you\u0027re talking about. The eye symbolizes human capability and greatness. If you haven\u0027t realized it, we ARE gods. There is no such thing as hell or heaven, it\u0027s all a legend created by men who desired to unite a separated world under one cause, God. Now, however, we are smart enough to know God is just a myth. Learn to be moral for your sake, not God\u0027s.",
  "This is what I\u0027ve been saying for so damn long. If anything, the Illuminati are our saviors. They have, in layman terms, the balls to do what the masses cannot. They are trying to change the world for the better. if you cannot see that, too bad, because most of the world unconsciously already follows their cause. Either adapt and learn to surpass the inhibitions religion and society place on your capability of knowledge, or fail at the hands of time. From now on I am Illuminati. We should all be",

Red Shift, expanding universe etc. If you want you can believe that God caused the Big Bang (even though there\u0027s no evidence for that) but you can\u0027t deny the Big Bang and go against every physicist in the world, that\u0027s very arrogant on your part.",

Besides, nobody is claiming they \"simply appeared\". Once again, you\u0027re \"Arguing from Ignorance\" Because YOU can\u0027t think of another explanation you give God the credit. Satan, like God, does not exist. I just like using that character to make Christians think about why their God doesn\u0027t stop him if both of them do exist.",

  "How about WE ALL JUST GET ALONG AND STOP GIVING A SHIT IF SOMEONE BELIEVES IN GOD OF NOT how do we expect to get along in this world when we let religion and science seperate us who agrees with me?",
  "The Christian argument commits the logical fallacy known as the \u0027Argument from Ignorance\u0027. It states that \"I can\u0027t imagine any other explanation therefore God\" Yet it doesn\u0027t provide any evidence for a god, not least the god of their particular religion. The Biblical account is full of mistakes that reflect the level of scientific knowledge at the time. More and more we are learning about the universe and know for sure that it was created from a single point ie The Big Bang.",
  "Please explain to me how the world was created if you know all of this stuff.",
  "Haha, you are a foolish one. Christian theology states that god is all knowing, all powerful and all god and that he created the universe (time and space). So what does this mean? It means that he exists outside of time and therefore cannot \"waste his time\" because it\u0027s a context that doesn\u0027t exist for an eternal being. If he is \"all god and all powerful\" he could destroy Satan in the blink of an eyelid, but no, he allows Satan dominion over human beings. There, I have proved God is dead.",

  "No. Once something like evolution has been proven and you can observe it you can\u0027t disprove it in the future. Science is always right means that a proven scientific theory can\u0027t be unproven. The BB was never proven, there was strong evidence that suggests that it is right but it\u0027s not a fact because we simply don\u0027t know.",
  "I\u0027m aware that evolution isn\u0027t excepted by all, but it\u0027s still a proven fact. You can even witness evolution in single cell organisms, under a microscope. The BB is not taught as absolute truth, it\u0027s taught as a theory. The people who right those books about the economy and gangs are written by experts and are backed up by actual hard evidence,; the people who right books about the Illuminati are written by conspiracy theorists and are not backed up by any evidence at all.",
  "Easily, you believe in the Illuminati, therefore you are a moron. Just because it\u0027s an opinion doesn\u0027t mean that it\u0027s right. I could have an opinion that the Moon is made of cheese but it doesn\u0027t mean that I\u0027m right; it just means that I\u0027m a moron. Science is never wrong, idiots like you are.",
  "Evolution has been proven, it\u0027s a 100% fact and is only denounced by bible bashing twats who don\u0027t know what they\u0027re talking about. The Big Bang theory (clue in the name) is a theory, it hasn\u0027t been discredited, we don\u0027t know what caused the Universe to exist but The Big Bang is a very likely option. The books about the economy and gangs have absolutely no relevance.",
  "So if I were to do research about whether or not there are cyborg Nazis living on the moon and I came across an article where some random guy who claimed to be an ex astronaut said that there were, you wouldn\u0027t call me a fucking moron for believing it? Like I said before, do some research, the Illuminati aren\u0027t some big, evil organisation out to rule the world and they never were, they don\u0027t even exist anymore, you moron.",
  "You\u0027re a moron. There are also published books saying that God created the Universe, Aliens exist and that all the world\u0027s leaders are alien reptiles in disguise. Your point is invalid.",
  "My point is that we know who they are, they\u0027re on the news, they\u0027re in Government etc.. A completely random person on the internet isn\u0027t. How do you know that they aren\u0027t just some lonely conspiracy theorist who lives in a basement? Do you want to know how I know he was full of shit? It\u0027s easy: THE ILLUMINATI DON\u0027T EXIST!!! Maybe you should do some research into who the Illuminati were, you fucking moron.",
