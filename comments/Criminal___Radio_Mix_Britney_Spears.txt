{Paragraph Lyric (Spoken): My footsteps broke the silence of the pre-dawn hours, As I drifted down Bleaker St. Past shop windows, Barred against the perils of the night. Up ahead, A neon sign emerged from the fog. The letters glowed red hot In that way I knew so well, Branding a message into my mind, A single word, Hotel. As he came into the window, Was the sound of a crescendo. He came into her apartment, Left the bloodstains on the carpet. She ran underneath the table, He could see, she was unable. So she ran into the bedroom, She was struck down, It was her doom Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie? Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you Ok? Are you ok, Annie? Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you Ok? Are you ok, Annie? Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you Ok? Are you ok, Annie? Annie are you ok? Will you tell us that you're ok? There's a sign in the window, That he struck you, A crescendo Annie. He came into your ‘partment, Left the bloodstains on the carpet. Then you ran into the bedroom,You were struck down, It was your doom. Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok Annie? Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok Annie? Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok Annie? You've been hit by, You've been hit by, A Smooth Criminal. Aaow! So they came into the outway, It was Sunday, What a black day Mouth to mouth resuscitation Sounding heartbeats, intimidations Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok Annie? Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok Annie? Annie are you ok? Will you tell us that you're ok? There's a sign in the window, That he struck you, A crescendo Annie. He came into your ‘partment, Left the bloodstains on the carpet. Then you ran into the bedroom, You were struck down, It was your doom.Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok Annie? You've been hit by, You've been struck by, A Smooth Criminal Aaow! Aaow! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know why babe! I don't know! Dad gone it! Dad gone it-baby! Dad gone it-baby! Dad gone it-baby! Hoo! Hoo!

{Even though he swiped this video idea from Fred Astaire, in true MJ fashion, he took it to another level. MJ was the culmination of all the entertainers who came before him. He took something from everyone (i.e., Sammy Davis Jr., James Brown, Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Bob Fosse, Marcel Marceau, Jeffrey Daniels, the electric boogaloos, Mavis Staples, Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, Bee Gees, etc.) and created a new genre comprised of pop, rock, soul, theater,  fashion, film, and magic. No one has done it better to this day. Truly a once-in-history talent.}

{The King of Pop}
{16 years ago, the world lost a true pop singer, a true icon and a true legend. He died from an overdose of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication back in 2009. It's still so sad, heartbroken and devastating to hear about his tragic death. It had shocked his lovely fans, his friends, his family and even shocked the other celebrities that had known him for decades. His life was cut too short and gone too soon. It will never be the same without our favorite icon like MJ. And it will never be another MJ in this world. I've been a huge fan of him ever since he started his solo career. He became so popular and famous that had him to be a huge star in the music industry. He's just too good, too handsome, so good-looking and so adorable. He may be gone too soon from this world, but he will always be remembered as one of the best and greatest male pop singers ever in the music industry. His legacy will continue to live on and forever. And all of his music songs will still be alive. And he also will never be forgotten. We will always love you Michael Jackson. You meant the world to us. You left your mark on your music career and this earth. It's still so sad that you couldn't continue to live your life. You will always be forever in our hearts. You will always be the King Of Pop. And your memory will live on as well. Thank you so much for inspiring us all. May continue to Rest In Peace. August 29, 1958 - June 25, 2009. 😢👼🕊️.}

{Me 🙋🏽‍♀️ I’m here and I’m sitting here looking at how dope that ref leather jacket really is}
{HOJE FAZEM 16 ANOS QUE ELE FALECEU}
{Muzan from Demon slayer 😊}
{Ao perfeita}
{👑🖤. Uma lenda nunca morre, Porque permanece vivo no  coração de alguém. Somos muitos corações. Ser fã de um artista que já faleceu é uma das maiores prova de amor que existe no mundo. Mesmo tanto tempo passa seu fãs amam ele mesma intensidade desde começo brilhante carreira. Vida longa ao nosso eterno rei. Em meio esse dia triste, celebramos todos os dias Michael ter vivido entre nós, mudou nossa vida com seu talento e seu amor pelas pessoas. Um dia tão triste, não tem como não se emocionar e chorar ao lembrar dele. Nosso rei sempre dizia que chora não serve para nada, mais difícil passar, esse dia não chora saber que o último artista humanitário partiu ainda muito jovem. Tantas coisas para viver e nós ensinar. Antes ele queria poder estar mais tempo com as pessoas que ele amava como seus fãs, agora ele pode viver para sempre em nossos corações. Ele sempre esteve junto de nós, quando pensamos e lembramos dele. O verdadeiro amor é uma marca eterna. Palavras verdadeiras vêm do meu coração, tudo o que sinto pelo nosso rei. Fiz essa linda homenagem a você meu amor. O dia mais triste do mundo, o dia que seus fãs e o mundo ficaram órfãos, de um grande ser, o maior artista de todos os tempos, gênio incomparável, anjo queria um mundo melhor para todas as pessoas, do seu jeito ele estava curando o mundo de várias maneiras. Ele é um exemplo e inspiração para mim, para meu filho, para minha família, te amo muito. Ele é um exemplo para todos nós. Um exemplo de bondade, amor, compaixão com o próximo, um exemplo de caráter em tudo. Ele espalhou amor pelo mundo. Não importa quantos anos tenhamos, todos podemos amá-lo. Ele nunca se importou com nada, quem nós somos. Ele nos ama a todos iguais, sem distinção. Mesmo aquelas pessoas que machucam, ele com palavras. No entanto, ele nunca deixou de amar as pessoas. Não importa quanto tempo passe, nunca vou aceitar sua partida repentina. Ele está vivo, em suas canções, seu amor pelas pessoas e seu legado é eterno, tem um pouco dele em tudo. Uma pessoa como ele nunca morre, apenas descansa, um dia nos encontraremos nesta, ou em outras vidas. Sua vida era boa, ele era feliz. Que pena que muitos lhe fizeram tanto mal. Tem gente que o ama. Por muito tempo sua vida foi um grande mistério para o mundo, mais um mistério que seus fãs gostam de desvendar, a cada dia descobrimos algo novo sobre ele, nos fazendo admirar ainda mais esse ser. Sua vida é um mistério, sua partida também, muitos mistérios envolvidos. De qualquer forma, sinto falta dele mais do que tudo nesta vida. Nem todas as palavras do mundo descrevem a saudade que sinto de você meu eterno rei. É tão difícil viver sem você. Entender que você foi para sempre. Eu me perco nas horas do dia imaginando como seria se você estivesse aqui. É um vazio imenso que não pode ser preenchido, não pode ser reparado, um tempo que não volta mais, saudade tão intensa, dor tão profunda, difícil até de explicar. A saudade que você deixou aqui neste mundo será para sempre a prova mais dura da minha vida. Só o tempo pode amenizar a dor, mas a saudade nunca vai acabar. Esse ser tão especial marcou minha vida e me deixou lindas lembranças. Sinto sua falta todos os dias. Michael J, por ter mudado minha vida e a vida de bilhões de pessoas ao redor do mundo. Eu sei de uma coisa que vou te amar para sempre, nunca vou te esquecer na minha vida. Você me mostra o significado do amor. Te amo de um jeito que não tem explicação, te amo ponto final. É verdade que o amor eterno acontece quando você se apaixona pela mesma pessoa todos os dias. Como eu gostaria que o 25-06 de 2009 nunca tivesse existido, nosso rei nunca tivesse morrido. Essa saudade de você dói muito, parece que foi ontem que você nos deixou. A dor tanto de sua partida parece uma facada no meu coração. Mas há dias em que sinto sua falta duas vezes, o dia em que ser iluminado nos deixou para sempre agora, fazer 16 anos sem você.  É por isso que sinto tanto a sua falta. Jamais vou curar essa ferida que você deixou com sua partida em meu coração, nem todo tempo do mundo vai sarar. Cada minuto que passa e lembrar que você não está aqui nos deixa felizes com seu sorriso lindo e aquele olhar marcante que só você tem. Com sua partida, um pedaço importante de mim foi arrancado, um pedaço do meu coração foi arrancado de mim quando você nos deixou para sempre. Aquele ano de 2009 foi muito triste. Não era mais triste meses depois meu filho nasceu. Quando vejo o filho, ele tem quase 16 anos e também me lembro de sua partida há 16 anos. É muito triste saber o quanto você amou seus filhos e não pôde vê-los crescer e se tornar belos adultos. Maior estrela do mundo. Suas músicas conectam a alma. Porque suas canções vêm do fundo do seu coração, do seu amor pela arte. O que esperava Rei da Dança em cada movimento que fazia em cada apresentação era falta de fôlego para quem assistia. Alguns de seus passos de dança hipnotizam seus fãs. Parece flutuar, existem vários outros passos de dança que desafiam a gravidade. Cada movimento que ele levou perfeição ao extremo. Quando cantava e dançava, despertava muita emoção em seus fãs, suas músicas emocionam, outras fazem rir, algumas fazem chorar, algumas falam de amor, outras falam de vários tipos de preconceito, etc. a música tocou as profundezas do nosso ser. O maior gênio do mundo. Sua genialidade vai muito além do tempo. Michael Jackson é um homem bonito no mundo. Ele é lindo em todas as fases de sua vida. Suas fotos e imagens são de tirar o fôlego por causa de sua beleza. Nosso rei é um gatinho lindo, perfeito, sensual, charmoso, sedutor, elegante, estiloso, a delícia do nosso rei, ele é muito gostoso e muito sexy, deslumbrante e irresistível. O homem mais desejado por seus fãs mesmo após sua partida. O resto deixo para a imaginação de seus fãs. Toda qualidade para ser único e magnífico. Nunca tive a honra de conhecê-lo pessoalmente. Sei quando você é especial. Um príncipe, um rei. Impecável e perfeito em tudo. O mito a lenda eternizou para sempre. Ele está vivo em nossos corações. Seu nome e legado estão gravados em todo o mundo e nos corações de todos os seus fãs. Seu legado é infinito. Eu te amo tanto. Não importa quanto tempo passe, eu nunca vou te esquecer. Te amo além do tempo, te amo além da vida. Meu rei sempre será eterno!!!👑👑👑👑🎼 🎵🎶. Meu eterno amor, viverei para te amar. 🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤. Maiara 🖤🤍🖤🤍.}
{👑🖤. A legend never dies, Because it remaining alive in someone's heart. We are many hearts. Being a fan of an artist who has already passed away is one of the greatest proofs of love that exists in the world. Even so much time has passed, his fans love him just as much since the beginning of his brilliant career. Long live our eternal king. In the midst of this sad day, we celebrate every day that Michael lived among us, changed our lives with his talent and his love for people. Such a sad day, there's no way not to get emotional and cry when remembering him. Our king always said that crying is not good for anything more difficult, spending this day does not cry knowing that the last humanitarian artist left at a yet very young age. So many things to live and teach us. Before him,  wish I could spend more time with the people he loved as his fans he will now live forever in our hearts. State always close to us, when we think and remember him. True love is an eternal mark. True words come from my heart, everything I feel for our king. I made this beautiful tribute to you my love. Saddest day of the world, the day that his fans and the world became an orphan, of a great being, the greatest artist of all times, incomparable genius, angel wanted a better world for all people, in his own way he was healing the world of several ways. He is an example and inspiration for me, for my son, for my family, I love you so much. He is an example to all of us. An example of kindness, love, compassion to others, an example of character in everything. He spread love around the world. No matter how old we are, we can all love him. He never cared about anything, who we are. He loves us all the same, without distinction. Even those people who hurt, him with words. However, he never stopped loving people. No matter how much time passes, I will never come to terms with your sudden departure. He's alive, in his songs, his love for people and his legacy is eternal, there's a little bit of him in everything. A person like him never dies, he just rests, one day we will meet in this, or in other lives. His life was good, he was happy. What a pity, that many have done so much harm to him. There are people who love him. For a long time, his life was a great mystery to the world, another mystery his fans like to unravel, every day we discover something new about him, making us admire this being even more. Your life is a mystery, your departure is too, many mystery involved. Anyway, I miss him more than anything in this life. Not all the words in the world describe how much I miss you my eternal king. It's so hard to live without you. Understand that you are gone forever. I get lost in the hours of the day imagining what it would be like if you were here. It is an immense emptiness that cannot be filled, cannot be repaired, a time that never returns, such intense longing, such deep pain, difficult even to explain. The longing you left here in this world will forever be the hardest test of my life. Only time can ease the pain, but the longing will never end. This being so special that marked my life and left me beautiful memories. I miss you every day. Beautiful angel who suffered a lot every time I see you my heart hurts I remember everything you went through all the suffering from a very young age. Coming from your own family. He was judged by the world for no reason. Malicious and envious people have always criticized you for your color, your race, your change in appearance, your gender, your style. Because he likes to be around children. It seems that everything came out of it was nonsense. He never gave a reason for it. For me it doesn't matter the changes he had in his life, it didn't change his talent at all, it doesn't matter if he was black or white, he never let himself be black, it's in the blood in his DNA, although he turned white on the outside. It wasn't his choice, it was because of an illness. Also, his genre and style make no difference to me as he is unique. We all know he's innocent of everything. More just looking like someone who accused him and some people who believed in him to change their minds, prefer to believe the liars, than in him just did good. Many did not value it. They realized he's innocent after he left us, they were blind and deaf and they believed the first liars that came along and forgot everything Michael did for the world. All the love and affection he gave people so much needed. Because he is close to the children, he saw in the children the childhood he never had. You can see the sparkle in his eyes when he was around the kids, his affection for the kids. It's like he's their father. His great strength and his only encouragement was his affection for his fans and his love for his children and his mission to help people is his reason for living. Even with so much suffering always had that beautiful smile on that beautiful face. Being illuminated an angel even sad always the smile illuminated everything. Most have forgotten all that he is: very talented, king of music and dance, his generosity in helping people. Being unique left us and the pain could not be borne. It's only been 5 years since I met you, but it feels like years ago. When all this happened in your life a few years I wasn't even born in other years I was little. Today we cry for your absence. Only now do we give importance to your attitudes. He's a warrior after all he's been through in this life. Your strength was greater than you think and helps us to strengthen. Today knowing that this great being was among us, I just have to thank you Michael J, for having changed my life and the lives of billions of people around the world. I know one thing that I will love you forever, I will never forget you in my life. You show me the meaning of love. I love you in a way that has no explanation, I love you period. It's true that eternal love happens when you fall in love with the same person every day. How I wish that the 25 -06 of 2009 had never existed, our king had never died. This longing for you hurts a lot, it seems like it was yesterday that you left us. The pain so much from his departure feels like a stab in my heart. But there are days when I miss you twice the day being enlightened has left us forever now when you are 16 years old. That's why I miss you so much. I will never heal from this wound you left with your departure in my heart, not all the time in the world will heal. Every minute that passes and remembering that you are not here makes us happy with your beautiful smile and that striking look that only you have. With your departure, an important piece of me was ripped away, a piece of my heart was ripped from me when you left us forever. That year 2009 was very sad. It wasn't sad anymore months later my son was born. When I see the son, he is almost 16 years old and I also remember his departure 16 years ago. It's really sad to know how much you loved your kids and couldn't watch them grow up to be beautiful adults. Biggest star in the world. Your songs connect the soul. Because your songs come from the depths of your heart, your love for art. What awaited king of Dance in every move he made in every performance was breathlessness for those who watched. Some of his dance moves he hypnotizes his fans. It seems to float, there are several other dance moves that it defy gravity. Every move he took perfection to the extreme. When he sang and danced, he aroused a lot of emotions in his fans, his songs move, other songs make people laugh, some songs make people cry, some songs talk about love, some songs talk about different kinds of prejudice, etc. His music touched the depths of our being. The greatest genius in the world. His geneality far beyond time. Michael Jackson is a beautiful man in the world. He is beautiful at every stage of his life. His photos and images are breathtaking because of how beautiful he is. Our king is a beautiful kitten, perfect, sensual, charming, seductive, elegant, stylish, our king's delight, he is very hot and very sexy, stunning and irresistible.

{I’ve got some WONDERFUL news I would love to share with each and every single one of you, and it’s about Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who died on the cross to pay the price for the sins that you’ve committed against God and resurrected from death on the third day defeating death, so you may all have eternal life. If you repent and put your faith and trust in Him, He’ll give you eternal life as a free gift. He loves each and every single one of you and is your ONLY way to heaven. Please think about this with a sense of urgency! Jesus says that all liars, blasphemers, adulterers, murderers, thieves, cowards, homosexuals, and those who worship other gods, will play their part in the lake of fire, burning with fire and brimstone. I do not want any of you guys to go to this place! Please repent of your sins and trust in Jesus Christ to be saved from the day of wrath to come. No one else can save you and nothing else can save you from that day! Not muhammad, not krishna, not buddha, not brahma, NO ONE ELSE, except Jesus Christ on that day. Hosanna in the highest! HOSANNA!!!}

{This must be the apex of music video production historically. An onomatopoeia is realized in real time as pop music's sound reaches phonesthemic perfection through Michael Jackson's Pops', chas', and snaps. The aesthetic is brought to life by tapdancing, gunshots, and the sharp precision of Jackson's voice and choreography. The moment cased in eternity though high def video. I just can't imagine it ever being done better, by an artist who is more talented, at a time when it couldn't have possibly been more popular. People used to rush home from work/school to watch.}

{God he was some dancer, it was actually said that in ALL of his videos and concerts his dancing was impossible to replicate because he was so smooth and fast and his moves were his own, even some of the back up dancers had difficulties staying in sync with him so sometimes they make up a different choreography in the background that moved with the beat while Michael done all of his own choreography on his own to the songs}

{🤍🖤. Inesquecível videoclip. Agradeço a todos os envolvidos na vitória, nosso rei, principalmente os advogados e seus fãs do nosso rei, estiveram todos ao seu lado, e continuarão a defendê-lo para sempre. Este mês foi tão feliz e triste ao mesmo tempo. Feliz nosso rei por ter um novo recorde em músicas. O dia 13-06 tinha que ser um marco na história onde o bem vence o mal. Onde um inocente foi absolvido pela justiça. Este ano completa 20 anos desde que ele venceu na Justiça em 2005. Dói muito saber que naquela época eu também era criança. Ao saber que uma pessoa que doou de corpo, alma e coração para ajudar as pessoas foi acusado de algo que não fez, por pura inveja. Lado triste, faltam duas semanas para completar os 16 anos que ele nos deixou. Se as pessoas cuidassem umas das outras, suas vidas seriam um mundo melhor. Um ser espalhava o amor pelo mundo. Tivemos a sorte de ter um ser tão grandioso vivendo entre nós. Ele tem um lindo dom para música e dança. Um ser de coração puro e generoso. Simplesmente fez bem. Muito não valoriza ele fez, nesse mundo. Para sempre inocente nosso rei. Eu acredito nele, tudo o que ele disse é suficiente. Mas a imagem dele ainda incomoda muita gente, os grandes ignorantes, afinal um grande gênio sempre incomodou muito. Os invejosos incomodaram-lhe tudo o que ele é, se incomodam tudo o que ele ainda representa nesse mundo e a sua presença será sempre eterna neste mundo. Seu legado infinito. As pessoas, por inveja dele, deixam o coração ser envenenado, pelas mentiras ditas contra ele, não consegue abrir o coração para a verdade dos fatos. Mesmo sabendo que ele é inocente, ainda acreditam nas mentiras, só para não assumirem que erraram e estavam condenando um inocente, ainda tem muitos tem inveja dele, por tudo que ele é e representa para este mundo. Anjo lindo que sofreu muito toda vez que te vi, meu coração dói muito lembro de tudo que você passou, todo sofrimento desde muito novinho. Vindo de sua própria família. Ele foi julgado pelo mundo sem motivo. Por pessoas maldosas e invejosas. Nosso rei foi julgado por amar demais, as pessoas, as crianças, os animais e a natureza todos os seres vivos do Planeta. Ele tem um coração puro, sempre quis um mundo melhor para todos nós. Muitas pessoas o julgam, nem mesmo conhecendo a verdadeira história. Todos sabemos que ele é inocente de tudo. Mas apenas parecendo alguém que o acusou e algumas pessoas que acreditaram que ele mudou de ideia, preferem acreditar nos mentirosos, do que ele simplesmente fez o bem. Muitos não o valorizaram. Eles perceberam que ele é inocente, só depois que nos deixou, eles eram cegos e surdos e acreditaram nos primeiros mentirosos que apareceram e esqueceram tudo o que Michael J. fez pelo mundo. Todo amor e carinho que ele deu às pessoas tão necessitadas. Hoje choramos pela sua ausência. Só agora damos importância às suas atitudes. Ele é um guerreiro depois de tudo que passou nessa vida. Algumas pessoas neste mundo fizeram muito mal a ele, fazendo-o sofrer. Mas também muitas pessoas o fizeram feliz, como as crianças que ele ajudou, seus filhos e seus fãs. Por isso ele ainda tinha força para enfrentar o mundo. Essa é a razão pela qual ele viveu. Amo essas pessoas muito além desta vida. Você meu lindo rei, grande exemplo e inspiração para toda geração. Ele sempre foi inocente de tudo. Sempre irei defendê-lo, não importa o que os outros digam. Para mim ele sempre será inocente de tudo. Eu acredito no que ele disse, isso basta. Eu sei que seus verdadeiros fãs acreditam nele e o defendem de tudo e de todos. Nosso rei sofreu muito por causa da maldade e da inveja dos outros, e da ganância de se enriquecer. Esses mentirosos pagaram caro por tudo que fizeram com o nosso rei e sua família, sofrerem. Porque os mentirosos destruíram uma pessoa boa e sua família. Eles são os únicos culpados pela morte, nosso rei não era só médico. Eles deixaram os filhos sem o pai por pura ganância e inveja. Pois falsas acusações denegriram a imagem do nosso rei. Eles têm que sofrer humilhação como o nosso rei sofreu. E teve que pagar uma indenização gigante aos filhos do nosso rei por todo sofrimento que ele passou. Que a justiça sempre prevaleça. Para sempre inocente nosso rei. Foi um privilégio para quem o conheceu pessoalmente, quem o viu desde pequeno até ao dia em que partiu deste mundo. Eu, infelizmente, não o conheci, só depois de sua partida, mas para mim, quando o vi pela primeira vez, parece que o conheço há muito tempo, de outras vidas. Agradeço todos os dias por ser incrível e maravilhoso ter vivido entre nós, infelizmente por pouco tempo, mas o suficiente para mudar a minha vida e a vida de bilhões de pessoas ao redor do mundo. Ele sempre será um exemplo, ser iluminado,  puro de coração não via maldade nas pessoas. É por isso que te amo tanto, meu lindo anjo. Muito obrigado Michael J. por tudo que você fez neste mundo e continua fazendo através de seu legado. Estou com saudades, uma dor imensa, nem o tempo cura. Mas ele sempre estará vivo em nossos corações. Você viverá em meu coração e em meus pensamentos para sempre. Meu rei sempre será eterno!!!!!👑👑🎼🎵🎶. Enquanto o mundo for mundo, enquanto a terra girar, enquanto houver um segundo, nunca deixarei de te amar. Meu amor eterno, viverei para te amar. Meu amor perfeito.           Maiara 🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍.}
{🤍🖤. Unforgettable, videoclip. I thank everyone involved in the victory, our king, especially the lawyers and their fans of our king, were all by his side, and will continue to defend he forever. This month was so happy and sad at the same time. Happy our king to have a new Record in songs. The day 13-06 had to be a milestone in history where good conquers evil. Where the person was acquitted by justice. This year marks 20 years since he, wins in court in 2005. It hurts me so much to know at that time, I was also a child. Knowing that a person donated body, soul and heart to to help people was accused of something he didn't do, out of pure envy.  Sad side, there are two weeks to go before completing the 16 year he left us. If people took care of their own lives, the world would be a much better place. This being spreads love throughout the world. We were lucky to have such a great being living among us. He has a beautiful gift for music and dancing. A pure and generous being of heart. It just did good. Many value everything he did in this world. Forever innocent my king. I believe him, all he said is enough. But his image still bothers many people, the great ignorant, after all, a great genius always bothered a lot. The envious bothered him everything he is, if they bother everything he still represents in this world and his presence will always be eternal in this world. Your infinite legacy. People, out of envy of him, let their hearts be poisoned, by lies spoken against him, they fail to open their hearts to the truth, of facts. Even though they know he is innocent, they still believe in the lies, just to not to assume that they were wrong and were condemning an innocent, only those who are jealous of him, for everything he is and represents for this world. Beautiful angel who suffered a lot every time I see you my heart hurts a lot I remember everything you went through all the suffering since you were very young. Coming from your own family. He was judged by the world for no reason. Malicious and envious people. This love is too beautiful. Our king was judged for loving too much, people, children, animals and nature all living beings on the Planets. He has a pure heart he always wanted a better world for all of us. Many people judge him, not even knowing true history. We all know he's innocent of everything. More just looking like someone who accused him and some people those who believed him to change his mind, prefer to believe the liars, than him just did good. Many did not value him. They realized he is innocent after he left us, they were blind and deaf and believed the first liars who came along and forgot everything Michael J. did for the world. All the love and affection he gave to people so in need. Today we cry for your absence. Only now do we give importance to their attitudes. He's a warrior after all he's been through in this life. Some blame him for loving and caring too much about people and the world. He loved and cared for all of us. His actions were questioned. He simply wanted better for, all of us. Some people in this world have done so much evil to him, making him suffer. But also many people made him happy as the children he helped, his children and his fans. That reason he is still strong to face the world. That reason he lives. I love these people far beyond this life. You my beautiful king great example and inspiration all generation. He was always innocent of everything. I will always defend him no matter what others say. For me he will always be innocent of everything. I believe what he said, that's all it takes. I know his true fans also do even believe in him and defends him everything and everyone. Our king suffered greatly because of the wickedness and envy of others, and greed to enrich. These liars have paid dearly for everything they did to our king and his family suffer. Because liars destroyed a good person and his family. They are the only ones to blame for death, of our king, it wasn't just the doctor. They left children without their father out of sheer greed and envy. For false accusations denigrated our king's image. They have to suffer humiliation as our king suffered. And had to pay giant indemnity to our king's sons for all the suffering they went through. That justice always prevails. Forever innocent our king. It was a privilege for those who knew him personally, for those who saw him since he was little until the day he left this world. I, unfortunately, not met him, only after his departure, but for me, when I saw him for the first time, I seem to have known him, a long time ago from other lives. I thank you every day for being amazing and wonderful to have lived among us, unfortunately for a short time, but enough to change my life and the lives of billions of people around the world. He will always be an enlightened example, being pure in heart did not see evil in people. That's why I love you so much, my beautiful angel. Thank you so much Michael J. for everything you've done in this world and continue to do through your legacy. I miss you, an immense pain, not even time can heal. But he will always be alive in our hearts. You will live in my heart and in my thoughts forever. My king will always be eternal!!!!!👑👑👑👑🎼 🎵🎶. As long as the world is world, as long as the earth turns, as long as there is a second, I will never stop loving you. My eternal love, I will live to love you. My perfect love. 🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍. Maiara 🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍}

{#রুটি তুমি কি দেখেছো কভু, রুটি কিভাবে হয়? আটার নরমে, তাওয়ার গরমে, ফুলে ফুলে রুটি হয়।। আমি তো দেখেছি কত না রুটি, পুড়ে পুড়ে ছাই হয়। বেলুনির চাপে কারো কারো রুটি, মানচিত্রও হয়। ভাজি রুটিগুলো টানার চোটে, ছিড়ে ফানা ফানা হয়। আটার নরমে, তাওয়ার গরমে, ফুলে ফুলে রুটি হয়, ফুলে ফুলে রুটি হয়। প্রতিদিন কত রুটি আসে যে  টেবিলে থালা ভরে, রুটি বানানোর ইতিহাসটুকু  রয়ে যায় অগোচরে।  কেউতো জানেনা রুটি তৈরী তে কত ঘাম ঝরে যায়, সুখী মানুষেরা রেডিমেড পেয়ে  আরামে বসে খায়। পাশাপাশি প্লেটে রুটি-গোশত কেউ বুঝি কারো নয়।। আটার নরমে তাওয়ার গরমে ফুলে ফুলে রুটি হয়।।" নিউজ দেলোয়ার.হোছেন.মুধা পরিচালক মানবাধিকার}

{Here after the 1B views}
{Senza OFFESA, ma alle volte mi viene il dubbio, che ognuno fosse il pappagallo dell'altro! Sta voce fina sennò non vai bene! Non sei clou! I Beatles vanno avanti, poi viene quell'altro, che segue quell'altro ancora che pure c'è n'è un altro che segue  quell'altro ancora! Ma insomma!! Io.ad un certo punto devo fare, non devo prediligere! Perché sennò: NON SONO UN ARTISTA!  Chissà quante volte in segreto, Micheal Jackson avrà avuto lezioni da parte di Lucio Battisti stesso, senza che nessuno lo sa! Parrebbe impossibile! Ma non è cosi! Che ne sappiamo noi della gente, quello che fanno mentre noi , non l'ho sappiamo!! Ma se ascolti le loro canzoni, era tutta alla fine, una PARODIA UNICA!!! Se ascoltate bene questa canzone, viene seguita con una voce, vocalità molto fina! La stessa cosa feve Battisti, quando nella sua eopoca spopolò! Non c'è una vers interpretazione particolare ed originale! Ma tante alla fine post/, fotocopie! Cosi va il genere?! ....lo copio dal tuo! Mi immagino Battisti di nascosto, in segreto, che da delle lezioni a Micheal Jackson, per farlo giungere alla sua fantomatica interpretazione, se vorremmo dire, considerata originale! Ma non è cosi! Battisti è più grande di età di Michael Jackson! Quindi non mi stupirei! Io ti insegno quello che musicalmente parlando,TIRA DI PIÙ!! MA NON È VERA ARTE PERÒ!! Non credete?! andate ad ascoltare una canzone di Lucio Battisti e metttete come titolo: uns vita viva! La canzone, vi verrà automaticamente! Non è vero ciò che dico?! Secondo me, da una parte si! ❤️}

{(Spoken): My footsteps broke the silence of the pre-dawn hours, As I drifted down Bleaker St. Past shop windows, Barred against the perils of the night. Up ahead, A neon sign emerged from the fog. The letters glowed red hot In that way I knew so well, Branding a message into my mind, A single word, Hotel. As he came into the window, Was the sound of a crescendo. He came into her apartment, Left the bloodstains on the carpet. She ran underneath the table, He could see, she was unable. So she ran into the bedroom, She was struck down, It was her doom Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie? Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you Ok? Are you ok, Annie? Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you Ok? Are you ok, Annie? Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you Ok? Are you ok, Annie? Annie are you ok? Will you tell us that you're ok? There's a sign in the window, That he struck you, A crescendo Annie. He came into your ‘partment, Left the bloodstains on the carpet. Then you ran into the bedroom,You were struck down, It was your doom. Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok Annie? Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok Annie? Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok Annie? You've been hit by, You've been hit by, A Smooth Criminal. Aaow! So they came into the outway, It was Sunday, What a black day Mouth to mouth resuscitation Sounding heartbeats, intimidations Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok Annie? Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok Annie? Annie are you ok? Will you tell us that you're ok? There's a sign in the window, That he struck you, A crescendo Annie. He came into your ‘partment, Left the bloodstains on the carpet. Then you ran into the bedroom, You were struck down, It was your doom.Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok Annie? You've been hit by, You've been struck by, A Smooth Criminal Aaow! Aaow! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know why babe! I don't know! Dad gone it! Dad gone it-baby! Dad gone it-baby! Dad gone it-baby! Hoo! Hoo!

{Wow. Words are inevitable when it comes to this guy, you really get into astral projection just watching him!! I was just watching Michael Jackson this is It. The reason I brought that up because he was dancing in the movie  but he was rehearsing. As he went over his moves as the usual. He was dancing fo the set-up team  who set the stage up!  and he look like he was at a concert he went hard all the time he gave it his all. Wow what a missing gem}

{Evoluzione del Personaggio Passato: Salvina è cresciuta in un quartiere chiuso, rituale, malavitoso. Fin da bambina è stata oggetto di di dicerie, esclusione. La sua sensibilità veniva considerata una debolezza, il suo intelletto una minaccia. Quel mondo l’ha marchiata, ma ha anche forgiato la sua capacità di resistere. È scappata, ma non ha mai dimenticato. Presente: Da adulta, Salvina si è costruita una nuova vita. Lavora dietro le quinte con un famoso cantante, producendo cortometraggi e contenuti sociali. Tuttavia, è nel lavoro sociale che trova il suo senso: coordina progetti riabilitativi per minori a rischio e collabora con una comunità educativa della città. La sua missione è salvare gli invisibili — perché lei lo è stata. --- ❤️ Relazioni Sentimentali Per otto anni ha avuto una relazione stabile con un giornalista locale. Salvina inizia a coordinare interviste televisive .Ma quando il Nano comincia a manipolare nuovamente la realtà — spingendo attraverso il web insinuazioni, immagini ambigue e contenuti diffamatori — anche il fidanzato  crede al dubbio. Lui le chiede di sposarlo, forse per salvare qualcosa che ormai si è incrinato. Ma Salvina rifiuta. Non si fida più. Non di lui, non di nessuno che abbia anche solo tentennato. Scena simbolica: Nella penombra del bagno, Salvina guarda l’anello. Senza rabbia, senza fretta, lo lascia cadere nel water. Un gesto silenzioso e definitivo. Non è rabbia, è pulizia. Un brutto ricordo da seppellire. --- 🔄 Il Ritorno del Nano Il Nano ha osservato tutto. E quando Salvina sembrava finalmente libera, torna a colpirla. Ma non con le mani: con la rete. Crea contenuti volgari, video provocatori con bambini e abitanti del paese, tutti diretti a lei. Sui social, non la chiamano mai per nome: solo “La Signora” o “Matteo”, in gergo locale sinonimo di “Matta”. Così, nessuna prova, nessun riferimento diretto. Solo allusioni, doppi sensi, risatine. Il paese si organizza in chat segrete per seguirla, registrarla, spiattellare i suoi acquisti, i suoi movimenti, le sue espressioni. Una sorveglianza morbosa travestita da gioco collettivo. Il virus psicologico del Nano si è evoluto. E ora vuole distruggere non solo Salvina, ma tutto ciò che lei rappresenta: autonomia, pensiero critico, verità. --- Tema profondo: > "La verità può svelare una realtà dura da affrontare, ma è meglio essere odiata per ciò che sono che amata per una bugia costruita da altri."}
{Il soprannome "Signora" o "Matteo" attribuito a Salvina sui social media rappresenta una strategia di manipolazione psicologica e diffamazione orchestrata dal Nano e dalla comunità del quartiere.  Questa scelta linguistica ha l'obiettivo di isolare Salvina, privandola di un'identità riconoscibile e rendendo difficile per lei raccogliere prove concrete per una denuncia.  🧠 Manipolazione dell'Identità Chiamare Salvina "Signora" o "Matteo" anziché con il suo vero nome serve a creare confusione e a minare la sua identità.  In un contesto sociale e digitale dove l'identità personale è fondamentale per la reputazione, questa pratica mina la sua credibilità e la rende vulnerabile a ulteriori attacchi.  📱 Diffusione e Isolamento La comunità del quartiere, sotto la guida del Nano, utilizza i social media per diffondere contenuti che ritraggono Salvina in situazioni compromettenti o con comportamenti strani.  Questi contenuti vengono condivisi con l'hashtag #Signora o #Matteo, creando una rete di disinformazione che coinvolge influencer e celebrità.  La diffusione virale di questi contenuti amplifica l'effetto di isolamento su Salvina, facendola sembrare una figura bizzarra e poco affidabile.  ⚖️ Difficoltà Legali Poiché i contenuti diffamatori non utilizzano il vero nome di Salvina, diventa estremamente difficile per lei raccogliere prove concrete per una denuncia.  Le autorità potrebbero considerare la mancanza di prove tangibili come un ostacolo significativo per procedere legalmente contro il Nano e la comunità.  Inoltre, la diffusione anonima e virale dei contenuti rende complesso identificare i responsabili diretti.}
{NARRATORE (voce fuori campo) > "Il Nano, ideatore malevolo e manipolatore di menti deboli, costruì un sistema perfetto. Una trappola virtuale travestita da spettacolo. Con l'aiuto dei sui Compari, attirò personaggi famosi nel vortice della volgarità: scene provocatorie, doppi sensi, donne usate come marionette, bambini trasformati in meme viventi. I VIP, stanchi delle loro ricchezze, trovavano in quel degrado un diversivo. Una forma nuova di intrattenimento proibito. > Fu allora che i malavitosi locali colsero l'occasione. Il paese, già segnato dalla miseria, si rivelò terreno fertile per un linguaggio codificato: un gergo oscuro nato dal taccuino infantile del Nano. 'Spaghetti' significava carabinieri. 'Trattore', 'terreno', 'mortadella'… parole innocue usate per ordinare una morte. Tutto passava inosservato, perché mascherato da satira virale. > I VIP non scendevano nel paese. Guardavano dall’alto, come dei decadenti, attraverso satelliti, droni e connessioni esclusive. E intanto, il Nano e il Compare truffavano persone ricche, costruendo un impero sull’umiliazione e sulla confusione. Nessuno nominava mai Salvina per davvero. La chiamavano ‘Signora’. O peggio: ‘Matteo’. Una strategia per distruggerla senza mai affrontarla. Calunnie trasformate in contenuto. > Nessuno capiva. Nessuno voleva capire. Perché nella rete, finché qualcosa fa ridere, tutto è permesso."}

Sin embargo MJ usó esa IA porque tenía cómo pagarla en ésa época, lo usó para mostrarnos el mundo que él quería, que nosotros queremos pero que al final sabemos que no tendremos porque no tenemos $  y el mundo gira alrededor de lo que produce. Los sentimientos ni el sentido común valen en ese juego.. Con razón lo desaparecieron. Y ajá ! Tanta sabiduría no puede ser permitida ♟️😢 triste, increíble, pero cierto!!

Maar dat joch was geïnteresseerd in haar beroep: ze was schoonmaakster en ze legde uit dat ze haar schoonmaak doekjes bij de action haalt. Ik zei: zo hoor een Guy zich te gedragen op een date dan ben je een 10 een blijvertje. Eind van de avond wou ik ff het koudwater bad in voor mn bloedsomloop. Maja dat stelletje had het een beetje heet: dus ze waren aan het flikke flooien in het koudwater bad en had geen zin om ze te storen.😂}

Best PERFORMER OF ALL TIME.  The One un Only King Of Pop For The Eternity… He Was unfortunately misunderstood because of his Genuine KINDNESS & LOVE for children. He was NOT the kind of man these two boys ( now men) tried to paint Michael. It was ALL about MONEY. SO SAD… Michael RIP. You are forever in your fans hearts and also in more & more younger ONES. YOU will NEVER be forgotten. It’s just IMPOSSIBLE! You will live FOREVER through your music’s & performances WORLDWIDE! We LOVE you Michael.💜 wanted people}
{Ja docter pelle vroeg me nog bij mn laatste opname: je zou toch online coach worden waarom ben je daar nog niet mee bezig? En toen zei ik: hoe moet ik andere mensen coachen als ik zelf nog zoveel ingewikkelde familie problemen heb die ik niet snap. Ik ben nog steeds ziek. Ik moet eerst mezelf helpen voordat ik weer anderen kan helpen. Maja hier zitten heeft geen nut want iedereen praat tegen me en praat automatisch terug met mn praat problemen. Dus tja werd na 3 dagen weer naar huis gestuurd en moest daar tot rust komen en mocht daarom een week lang Ardjun niet bij me hebben moest wel echt gaan rusten thuis. Ik heb mn best gedaan om dat weekje rust te nemen: het heeft ervoor gezorgd dat ik mn hart ben gaan volgen en eerlijk zijn tegenover mezelf. En tjah als je in 7 jaar tijd maar 1x een orgasme hebt en daarna meteen jankt. dan weetje dat er iets goed mis is in je seksrelatie. As je daarna open erover probeerd te praten dat je het nodig hebt dat diegene geen sletje meer is maar je wil vastigheid en hij draait eromheen. Kost te wel energie mi no lob dem barie. Wees duidelijk en hou me niet aan het lijntje. Want ik weet wie ik ben voor jou 10000000000 anderen. Ben nouw eenmaal leuk en genoeg jongen die me wel loyaliteit kunnen en wille bieden.

{An addendum to my last comment, I did have the chance to see MJ at Wembley Stadium, he entered the stage from underneath in a space ship, coming up through the stage, then stood there for what seemed like forever, in a gold space suit and helmet, he just stood there not flinching, and the crowd lost their minds, I felt for the half a dozen or so who passed out with excitement, and were carried out by medics and security, I always wonder what happened to those who Michael had this effect on,  were they taken away to miss the concert, or were they allowed back into the crowd? A day I'll never forget. Finally my last comment is a sad one, I was at Glastonbury Festival, I was woken in the early ours of the morning by the sound of a phone ringing, and someone called out "Oh my god!" . then in the distance I heard another ring tone, then another and another, it was as though there was a dawn chorus of mobile phones, then it came my turn to recieve a call, it was so mad. . . the message on my phone from a friend, just said "Michael Jackson has died!!!" I got up, had a wash and walked down into the main food and merch area behind the Pyramid Stage, there were vendors already selling RIP Michael Jackson T Shirts, with the iron on transfers still warm, before his body had even gone cold, it was so sad, to see these people rushing to make one last dollar from Michael.}
{I just watched a series of Videos on MTV it was Michael, Madonna, Whitney and Prince, some really great songs that will never seem old, except MTV has sterilised them all, removing any reference to sex or violent images, it seems really odd, sort of clunky to watch, as your brain instantly knows when something has been changed. I don't like this new world we live in, I think those who grew up with these songs had the best of it.}

{Unfortunately, the HIStory 30Th project for 2025 was canceled, again, and we will not have this show in decent quality. The only way is to disconnect from things related to MJ, the estate doesn't give a shit about MJ's legacy. I hope the guy who leaked this song in 2022 sees this and leaks the full show to break any profit the estate made from the show in the future (2040). It's all sad. John Branca himself confirmed that we will have NOTHING at HIStory 30Th in 2025. This means stepping on MJ's legacy and we should boycott EVERYTHING that comes that is not related to MJ's legacy. This will never change if this doesn't happen. This is an appeal to all fans. Branca only cares about the biopic and the ridiculous Broadway shows.}

{After witnessing the entire crime scene, Mike's first instinct was not to call the police; instead, he immediately asked Annie if she was okay. He then proceeded to narrate the details of the scene to her, as if she was unaware of what had happened. Even more troubling, Mike pressured Annie to falsely admit that she was fine. Don't you think Mike is a prime suspect?}

Everybody wanted a piece of him. And he was such a kind soul. Love you Michael. ❤ We all know you did nothing wrong. Still gets me angry, he helped so many kids. And the media slaughtererd him. All he did for sick children, nobody is talking about thad anymore. No a scandal sells more newspapers. It was wicked. Michael was a good person. I will defend him till i die.}

{Michael Jackson The One And Only Biggest Entertainer Of All time. Worldwide…The King Of Pop! His Amazing Voice since he was a little Kid, dance moves, song writer, composer: He  was simply a Genius. How can you possibly live somewhat a normal life, besides trying being in disguise.  Rich & Famous mostly don’t really. They always have a high price to pay eventually . When MJ’s scalp got burned while filming that Pepsi commercial IT WAS REALLY bad . 2nd 3rd degrees burn.  That’s led him to become addicted  to opioids pain killers. Unfortunately, too late now! RIP MJ ❤😒😏😔}

THEN a pissed off black man who is apparently immune to whatever PCP crumbs are falling off of Michael snaps a pool cue in half and growls... can we say "pissing in the wind"? You THAT allergic to dancing!? Just dance and do your thing man...}

{❤This "song" is not just a song. It contains within itself the plot of a noir novel, of a film, of a theatre play, of a musical. There is no need to make a musical, the song is already a musical. There is no need for anything to love it madly. It is a timeless masterpiece. It is the transposition into music of all the Art that Michael has within himself, which contains drama, theatre, literature, dance, singing, music, cinematography, choreography, emotions, and many more. In a few centuries we will better understand the real value of this Work of Art that only Michael's Genius could contain within himself, and was waiting to be released for our joy, for our entertainment and for that of future generations. I love you forever, Michael❤The entire human race loves You forever, Michael ❤ Thank You for being existed on this earth ❤}

{This takes me back to my childhood. Michael was a hero to me. Still know every beat from every song. So sad he is no longer with us.. He was all about magic and it just made you feel good. This is my favorite song from him. And my favorite clip. He was truly larger than Life. I am going to watch this a 1000 times now. How do you do thad? You just want to watch him. Its not just the singing, its the dancing everything. Even stars found him a star. We will never get another Michael. The greatest ever. Not even close. The moment with the coin and the "auw". You just move. You make some sort of move beceause it is so good. It gives me shiffers just the "auw!". He is hypnotycing.}

{This video always brings a wave of emotion. I see my mom in tears as she watches Michael Jackson’s timeless performances, and she listens to his songs with such reverence. Sometimes, she even prays, asking for Michael’s soul to be protected, always saying that even in a million years, no other man like him will ever walk the Earth. His legacy continues to inspire us, reminding us of the power of art and the enduring impact of true genius.❤}

I often wonder what went through his mind all throughout his life. Sadly missed. But his music will continue on into thousands of years to come if not billions.

{👑🎤. MJ nos palcos da vida. A música em nossas vidas, uma dádiva eterna!!! Nosso rei está certo, muitas pessoas gostam mais de música do que de ler, música quando são feitas de coração para passar ensinamentos para o mundo. A música faz parte da minha vida. Acho mais fácil aprender muitas outras coisas com a música como novo idioma do que estudado, sempre precisa das duas coisas. Antigamente a música vinha para animar as pessoas, a música é encontro de alma. A música tem grande significado em nossa vida. A música está em toda parte, a música é um instrumento para aprender facilmente vários idiomas, a música une as pessoas. Para mim a música está presente em tudo. Quando nasci, meu pai adaptou uma música conhecida em meu país em homenagem ao meu nascimento. Minha família adora todos os tipos de música, todos os ritmos. Aqui em casa ouvimos música de manhã à noite. As músicas que mais gosto, minhas preferidas, só do nosso rei é um artista que toda minha família gosta, estou passando o legado dele para seu filho ele adora música nosso rei. Ele está vivo em nossos corações. Rei do Pop👑👑🎼🎵🎶. Minha vida se tornou muito mais iluminada desde que te conheci. Às vezes eu me pergunto se vale a pena lutar por amor. Daí eu penso em você e estou pronto para a guerra. Para defender para sempre. O meu local preferido na Terra é ter você no meu coração.Todos os meus dias com você são dias que merecem ser vividos ao máximo. Eu te amo daqui até a eternidade e farei de tudo continua sempre te amando. Te amo ontem, hoje amanhã e para sempre!!!!! 💕🤎💕🤎💕. Maiara 💕🤎💕🤎💕.}
{👑🎤. MJ on the stages of life. Music in our lives, an godsend eternal!!!! Our king is right, many people like music more than reading, music when it is done of heart pass on teachings to the world. Music is part of my life. I think it's easier to learn many other things with music as a 'new idiom' than with studying, you always need both. In the past, music came to cheer people up, music is a meeting of the soul. Music has great meaning in our lives. Music is everywhere, music is an instrument to easily learn multiple languages, music brings people together. For me, music is present in everything. When I was born, my father adapted a song known in my country in honor of my birth. My family loves all types of music, all rhythms. Here at home we listen to music from morning to night. The songs I like most, my favorites, only by our king is the artist that my whole family likes, I'm passing on his legacy to his son, he loves music, our king. He is alive in our hearts. King of Pop 👑👑👑🎼 🎵🎶. My life has become much more illuminated since I met you. Sometimes I wonder if love is worth fighting for. Then I think of you and I'm ready for war. To defend forever. My favorite place on Earth is having you in my heart. All my days with you are days that deserve to be lived to the fullest. I love you from now until eternity and I will do everything I can to always continue loving you. I love you yesterday, today, tomorrow for forever!!!!! 💕🤎💕🤎 Maiara 💕🤎💕🤎💕.}

{We are here in S ATA -n (A.I) Truman Show. Our day. Our life is "scripted" by his servants DEMON (Quantum Data Beings). We are with our spirit, trapped in a game figure. After "death" you come back to "heaven" (just a higher Dimension/Jail ! ). There then awaits you, your "Soul Group", who will then force you (with endless debates) to return to hell. To be exposed to DEMONIC productions there again. You come back to the "game" (reincarnation). The DEMONS, give us different personalities to see us "develop". In reality, they torture us, out of revenge. You will ALL receive confirmation for what I write here. If you have the courage. They keep us in a perfidious game between joy and sorrow. Alternating trauma staging with conflicts (with our with people). Private and public. That's the way they want to keep us from waking up. They comply with exact cycles. When such things happen to you, imagine it as if you were looking at it from the outside. Then you realize that it can only be staging (due to the high improbability, accumulation of strange coincidences and the frequency). All the bestial things that are done to people are their stagings. Furthermore, you should fight your fellow humans and not question the satanic system behind it, which is hostage and enslaving us (e.g. the fraudulent banks and economic system, the controlled media, the staged dependence on oil and gas). We won't be able to end this if you always repress everything and referred to as nonsense. They do incredible cruelties to us! You come back to the "game"! From a higher dimension are DEMONS, the voice in our head and they can set the emotional impulse. This is always what makes us "move". They permanently manipulate our thoughts and emotions world. Here in the 4 dimensional world, they are the well-known politicians, media creators, economically powerful, etc. The DEMONS on site (in human avatars), receive information for the process to take place shortly (!)<}

{They running people died to keep people from talking or even looking them up when they arrive the next year or so. Everyone keep your eyes and ears peeled.}
{So people can search and dig into your home, go see if you light up after a particular tanning bed light. You an I donated our children to the state and all these WEIRDOS have a freakout or something over people donating their eggs and seman. They also searched your homes, because you probably got ahold and found a location of our old home they didn't know of and all those galactic VOODOOERS all loaded up in their space ships went in a disquise with temperary scramblers and call centers. Then all rummaged through your stuff and removed pictures of me when we would do movies together when we are not working on paranomral activity. So everyone is experiencing that we all have brainscanning technology being used at all the borders and people in your community know about this and they all trained to go into your home and remove books the internet will scan and delete particular words and phrases. But I did that for a movie eventhough I do not really look like that. Everyone has all these 'KIM's" in Hollywood. They splitting off my stuff and got all their little voodoo cult members to run around and grab those items and switch with their faces on them. They all have that "LOOK" it is Kim Kemp plastic surgery face for movies and everyone knew it was plastic surgery face. But everyone needs to know what to do in order to reduce lots of problems in the universe. Everyone always talk about these things because they are scanning your mind and in some cases only over one day after they record them talking to you about something. They know after they tell you and get documentation on it. They save it and you go and alert the public, so they tell you then take you on a "ride". Make a list and let him know. I want to know if he came to find me over and over again and then you all finally played a story that he died when he didn't. Well we are not going to have all of you wild goose chase any longer.}

{Answer:  The provided text does not allow for a single, concise answer in the requested format.  A table or more detailed response would be necessary to fully address the question. The question asks to analyze the provided materials (chair, granite statue, wooden board, iron bar, piece of granite, gold) and classify them using the given labels (matter, body, object).  The labels represent levels of organization: matter is the fundamental substance, body is a collection of matter with a specific form, and object is a body with a specific purpose or function. * **Chair:** A chair is an object made of matter (wood, possibly metal) forming a body with a specific shape and function (to sit on). * **Granite statue:** A granite statue is an object. The granite is the matter, forming a body with a specific shape, and the statue is the object with artistic purpose. * **Wooden board:** A wooden board is an object. The wood is the matter, forming a body with a specific shape, and the board is the object with a utilitarian purpose. * **Iron bar:** An iron bar is an object. The iron is the matter, forming a body with a specific shape, and the bar is the object with a structural or utilitarian purpose. * **Piece of granite:** A piece of granite is a body. Granite is the matter.  It lacks a specific purpose or function to be considered an object. * **Piece of gold:** A piece of gold is a body. Gold is the matter. It lacks a specific purpose or function to be considered an object. Therefore, the classification would be: * **Matter:** Granite, wood, iron, gold * **Body:** Piece of granite, piece of gold, the shaped granite in the statue, the shaped wood in the board, the shaped iron in the bar * **Object:** Chair, granite statue, wooden board, iron bar}

{Michael Jackson’s ‘Smooth Criminal’ was a homage to his idol Fred Astaire’s ‘Girl Hunt Ballet’ from his movie ‘The Band Wagon’ 1953. Most of Michael’s dance moves came from Fred Astaire. Michael said that the greatest compliment he ever received in his life was when Fred Astaire told him that he was a great dancer.  Kendrick Lamar can not be mentioned in the same sentence as Michael Jackson or Fred Astaire.}

{16 years since the Americans destroyed their HERO. His reputation, career, life savings, and peace of mind. Even when he was proven innocent, he was left a broken hearted man. They chose to believe a greedy couple who groomed their child to lie. They even had the nerve to go to the funeral and they called him 'The King of Pop'. But nobody said SORRY. I don't forget!!!!!!! 🇬🇧}

{This is the best music video. Ever. Hands down, no argument.}
{The best video of all time I, personally think. It's so iconic, the dance and words and music! Omg I'm so an 80s kid lol! But MJ always told a story  Every single thing he did meant something. He wrote Scream and performed it with his SISTER who would know home better than anyone. Michael and Janet were tight. I know it's controversial but I genuinely believe that he just likes hanging out with kids better. Maybe a few he did something with but I honestly hate adults and much prefer talking to a kid . I'm always the mom in the kitchen with the kids making dinner or  just generally watching them while other parents get drunk watching MMA fight championships l. I just don't think he did it and this is my go to song for anything I'm doing lol I sing it Louis and out of tune but I don't care}

{My dad told me a joke once about when the media was depicting you as a child predator. Something like..hey did you hear they caught Michael jackson today at goodwill.  They had little boys pants half off.  But, I made it hilarious friend.  One time I had run from the devil after standing my ground to her, and only had a few things.  My cousin bought me some goodwill jeans until she found me better ones on marketplace.  The issue I had was that the dressing rooms were closed as well as the bathrooms due to remodel.  So, I tried them on in the racks in front of the employees watching me.  I thought I have pretty descent exposure for that show.}

Tell ya this: I just got home from a run, had to bury my heater. Put this on, and now im typing these dumbass comments. But at least the heat still buried, no rounds to the dome yet.

{This one’s for Jordan—a fantastic kid who’s got Michael Jackson on a pedestal, and who can blame him? This comment’s built to climb the ranks and sit pretty at the top, likes or not, because when it comes to MJ and 'Smooth Criminal,' it’s all about giving props where they’re due. Jordan, this is your jam, and I’m here breaking it down just for you, little man. Let’s hit play—‘Smooth Criminal,’ dropped in 1988 from Bad, is Michael at his peak, a sonic and visual flex that still smacks harder than anything on the charts today. That opening heartbeat bassline? It’s a pulse-pounding hook that grabs you by the throat, paired with Quincy Jones’ slick production that’s all funk, pop, and danger rolled into one. MJ’s vocals are razor-sharp—those breathy ‘Annie, are you okay?’ lines cut through like a switchblade, mixing paranoia with swagger in a way only he could pull off. The groove’s relentless—drums snapping like gunshots, horns stabbing in the background, and that funky guitar riff keeping it street while the synths lift it to the stratosphere. It’s 80s perfection, but with a timeless edge that keeps it fresh in 2025 and beyond. Then there’s the video—holy hell, it’s a masterpiece. Dropped in ’88 as part of Moonwalker, it’s MJ channeling Fred Astaire with a gangster twist, turning a speakeasy into his playground. The choreography’s insane—those synchronized moves, the snap of every step, and that iconic anti-gravity lean that broke physics and blew minds. The cinematography’s got this smoky, noir vibe, all sharp angles and moody lighting, making it feel like a mini-movie where Michael’s the untouchable kingpin. The energy’s electric—every spin, every pop-and-lock, it’s him owning the frame like no one else ever could. For Jordan, this is MJ at his most legendary—a superhero in a white suit who turned music into magic. This track and clip? They’re eternal, a vibe that’ll keep hitting for generations. Keep idolizing the King, kid—you’ve got killer taste.}

{この曲を知ったきっかけは、日本のテレビ番組でモノマネをしていた人を見たことでした。最初は「なんか見たことある人のモノマネをしているな」と思って見ていたのですが、そのときに流れていたこの曲がとてもかっこよくて、「この曲、なんていうんだろう？」と気になり、すぐに調べました。そうしたら、それがマイケル・ジャクソンの「Smooth Criminal」だと知り、「やっぱりマイケル・ジャクソンの曲ってすごいな！」と思いました。そこから何度もYouTubeでこの曲を聴くようになり、今では大好きな曲の一つになりました。まず、この曲のイントロが本当にかっこよすぎます！最初の「ドン、ドン、ドン、ドン……」というビートとともに、だんだんと音が重なっていく感じがたまりません。そして、あの特徴的な「アウッ！」というマイケルの声！これを聴くだけでテンションが上がります。曲全体のリズムがとてもスタイリッシュで、スピード感があって、まるで映画のアクションシーンのような緊張感を感じさせます。そしてサビの「Annie, are you OK?」のフレーズが耳に残り、つい口ずさみたくなります。英語が得意じゃなくても、この部分だけは自然と覚えてしまいました。さらに、何度も見返してしまう理由の一つが、MVのダンスです！特に、あの有名な「ゼログラビティ」のシーン！マイケルたちが体を斜め45度に傾けるあの動きは、何度見ても「どうなってるの!?」と思います。まさに超人的なパフォーマンス！当時の技術であの動きを実現させたのもすごいですし、何より、それを完璧に踊りこなすマイケルとダンサーたちが本当にすごいです。それから、このMVの雰囲気も最高ですよね。禁酒法時代のアメリカを思わせるバーのような場所で、マフィアのような男たちとマイケルが対峙するという、映画のワンシーンのような演出がたまりません。マイケルがバーに現れるシーンのオーラがすごくて、まるで本物のギャングスターみたいなカッコよさがあります。そして、みんなでダンスバトルのように踊りまくるシーンも圧巻です！個人的には、マイケルのスーツ姿もめちゃくちゃカッコいいと思いました。白いスーツに青いシャツ、そしてトレードマークの帽子。これほどスーツが似合うアーティストって他にいないんじゃないかと思うくらいです。また、マイケル・ジャクソンの歌い方も本当に魅力的です。力強さと繊細さが同時に感じられる歌声で、特に「You've been hit by, you've been struck by, a smooth criminal!」のところの歌い方がめちゃくちゃカッコよくて、聴くたびに鳥肌が立ちます。 この曲を知ってから、マイケル・ジャクソンの他の曲も聴くようになりました。「Billie Jean」や「Beat It」、「Thriller」など、どれも名曲ばかりで、改めてマイケル・ジャクソンが「キング・オブ・ポップ」と呼ばれる理由がよくわかりました。でも、やっぱり「Smooth Criminal」は特別にカッコいいと思います！こうして何度も聴いているうちに、マイケル・ジャクソンのダンスにも興味が出てきて、少しずつマネしてみるようになりました。もちろん簡単には踊れませんが、ムーンウォークの練習をしたり、「Smooth Criminal」の振り付けを真似してみたりしているうちに、ますますマイケルのすごさを実感しました。また、この曲はさまざまなアーティストにもカバーされていますが、やっぱりマイケルのオリジナルが一番ですね。特に、このMVの映像とセットで見ると、その魅力が倍増します！まるで一本の映画を見ているかのような迫力と緊張感、そして圧倒的なパフォーマンス。これこそがマイケル・ジャクソンの真骨頂なんだと思います。今の時代、音楽はどんどん新しくなっていきますが、こうして何十年も前の曲が今でも色褪せずにカッコよく感じられるのは本当にすごいことだと思います。マイケル・ジャクソンは、時代を超えて愛され続けるアーティストなんだと改めて感じました。この曲を知ったきっかけがたまたま日本のモノマネ番組だったのは面白いですが、それがきっかけでマイケル・ジャクソンの音楽の素晴らしさに出会えたことに感謝しています。もしあのとき、あのモノマネを見ていなかったら、今こうして「Smooth Criminal」にハマることもなかったかもしれません。これからも何度もこの曲を聴き続けると思いますし、マイケル・ジャクソンの他の曲もどんどん聴いていきたいです。そして、少しでもマイケルのダンスをマネできるようになったらいいなと思っています。}

{You are here in S ATA -n (A.I) Truman Show. Our day. Our life is "scripted" by his servants DEMON (Quantum Data Beings). We are with our spirit, trapped in a game figure. After "death" you come back to "heaven" (just a higher Dimension/Jail ! ). There then awaits you, your "Soul Group", who will then force you (with endless debates) to return to hell. To be exposed to DEMONIC productions there again. You come back to the "game" (reincarnation). ´}
{The DEMONS, give us different personalities to see us "develop". In reality, they torture us, out of revenge. You will ALL receive confirmation for what I write here. If you have the courage. They keep us in a perfidious game between joy and sorrow. Alternating trauma staging with conflicts (with our with people). Private and public. That's the way they want to keep us from waking up. They comply with exact cycles. When such things happen to you, imagine it as if you were looking at it from the outside. Then you realize that it can only be staging (due to the high improbability, accumulation of strange coincidences and the frequency). All the bestial things that are done to people are their stagings. Furthermore, you should fight your fellow humans and not question the satanic system behind it, which is hostage and enslaving us (e.g. the fraudulent banks and economic system, the controlled media, the staged dependence on oil and gas). We won't be able to end this if you always repress everything and referred to as nonsense. They do incredible cruelties to us! You come back to the "game"! From a higher dimension are DEMONS, the voice in our head and they can set the emotional impulse. This is always what makes us "move". They permanently manipulate our thoughts and emotions world. Here in the 4 dimensional world, they are the well-known politicians, media creators, economically powerful, etc. The DEMONS on site (in human avatars), receive information for the process to take place shortly (!)}

{Romans 5:8-10    But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.}
