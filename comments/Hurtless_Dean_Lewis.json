  "Heres some things to say to your bulliesthis is fir everyone . A glowstick has a brighter future than you.  It’s sad what happened to your face. Oh wait, that’s how it\u0027s always looked . I\u0027m listening. I just need a minute to process so much stupid information at once.  When I look at you, I think to myself where have you been my whole life? And can you go back there? You’re the reason the divorce rate is so high. All mistakes are fixable—except for you.  You are like a software update. Every time I see you, I immediately think, \"Not now.\" Earth is full. Go somewhere else.  I told my therapist about you. She didn\u0027t believe me.  You can\u0027t imagine how much happiness you can bring…by leaving the room. I don\u0027t want to rain on your parade! I\u0027d rather summon a typhoon I\u0027d smack you, but I\u0027m against animal abuse.  You just might be why the middle finger was invented in the first place. When you were born, the doctors probably threw you out of the window, but the window threw you back.   . I never forget a person’s face, but I’ll be happy to make an exception in your situation. I consider you my sun. Now please get 93 million miles away from here.   I look at you and think, \"Two billion years of evolution, for this?\" You are my sun it hurts to look at you",

I’ve watched my father decline for years and lost him recently in a very traumatic way as in I saw his last breath two days after my birthday.

  "Lyrics   I remember the day that we met You were like a light I didn\u0027t know that I needed You had a smile that could warm up the New York cold It wasn\u0027t long till we both caught feelings I didn\u0027t know that we both had demons But it\u0027s funny how time reveals it all And you stayed out that night after we had a fight And my friends said they saw you with him At that bar where we met, while I\u0027m here in our bed Do you even regret what you did? \u0027Cause it was never meant to end like this Standing in the rain in your black dress So go ahead and tell me what I did to deserve this And I\u0027m not saying we were perfect I hope that one night with him was worth it But telling me that it was a mistake don\u0027t make it hurt less It don\u0027t make it hurtless I\u0027m standing there as you list off your reasons Made me feel like a fool for believing You reach for my hand as I turn to leave But you keep on holding on And your eyes started falling weighed down with despair And you turned around and said, \"This isn\u0027t fair\" It was only one night there were no feelings shared So I looked in your eyes and I said It was never meant to end like this Standing in the rain in your black dress So go ahead and tell me what I did to deserve this And I\u0027m not saying we were perfect I hope that one night with him was worth it But telling me that it was a mistake don\u0027t make it hurt less It don\u0027t make it hurtless I know the day will come when this won\u0027t hurt anymore And all the pain is just an afterthought If I\u0027m strong enough to let you in I can let you out again And I hope someday you\u0027ll find someone to love you like I did \u0027Cause it was never meant to end like this Standing in the rain in your black dress So go ahead and tell me what I did to deserve this And I\u0027m not saying we were perfect I hope one night with him was worth it But telling me that it was a mistake don\u0027t make it hurt less It don\u0027t make it hurtless It don\u0027t make it hurtless It don\u0027t make it hurtless",

Then at the end he opens his eyes and it cuts to the woman and the medical staff, with the lips mouthing something like \"okay\". But then it cuts back as the staff is leaving, the bed is empty. Did he recover and has been taken elsewhere for a checkup or procedure? The way the staff told her and she reacted, it didn\u0027t seem like it was \"bad news\".",

  "\"Do you even regret what you did? \u0027Cause it was never meant to end like this So go ahead and tell me what I did to deserve this\" these were exactly my thoughts when my ex cheated on me. I was so dumb and naive for believing everything he said. For almost 4 years, I dedicated my ENTIRE life to him.  When I found out and brought up the thing he did, he denied it but still, I broke up with him. I cannot bear all the lies and shit he did to me. He did not even regret a single thing he did and I keep asking myself if I deserve it all?? Why there are people like this? All I wanted was what\u0027s best for him but he didn\u0027t care. I was so happy to be out of that fvcking relationship but the TRAUMA and PAIN are still there.  It comes in waves where you feel better now then feel miserable an hour after. I develop a lot of mental issues because of what he did.  I am also thankful for my new guy, he is the most supportive partner and he\u0027s with me with all the battles I am facing. Everybody deserves healing. Hope everyone will get through shit and get out of any cheating partners they have now.",

  "✨✨✨ I remember the day that we met You were like a light I didn\u0027t know that I needed You had a smile that could warm up the New York cold It wasn\u0027t long till we both caught feelings I didn\u0027t know that we both had demons But it\u0027s funny how time reveals it all And you stayed out that night after we had a fight And my friends said they saw you with him At that bar where we met, while I\u0027m here in our bed Do you even regret what you did? \u0027Cause it was never meant to end like this Standing in the rain in your black dress So go ahead and tell me what I did to deserve this And I\u0027m not saying we were perfect I hope that one night with him was worth it But telling me that it was a mistake don\u0027t make it hurt less It don\u0027t make it hurtless I\u0027m standing there as you list off your reasons Made me feel like a fool for believing You reach for my hand as I turn to leave But you keep on holding on And your eyes started falling weighed down with despair And you turned around and said, \"This isn\u0027t fair\" It was only one night there were no feelings shared So I looked in your eyes and I said It was never meant to end like this Standing in the rain in your black dress So go ahead and tell me what I did to deserve this And I\u0027m not saying we were perfect I hope that one night with him was worth it But telling me that it was a mistake don\u0027t make it hurt less It don\u0027t make it hurtless I know the day will come when this won\u0027t hurt anymore And all the pain is just an afterthought If I\u0027m strong enough to let you in I can let you out again And I hope someday you\u0027ll find someone to love you like I did \u0027Cause it was never meant to end like this Standing in the rain in your black dress So go ahead and tell me what I did to deserve this And I\u0027m not saying we were perfect I hope one night with him was worth it But telling me that it was a mistake don\u0027t make it hurt less It don\u0027t make it hurtless It don\u0027t make it hurtless It don\u0027t make it hurtless",

  "*weniger schmerzhaft* (deutsche Übersetzung)  Ich erinner mich an den Tag, an dem wir uns getroffen haben. Du warst wie ein Licht, von dem ich nicht wusste dass ich es brauchte. Du hattest ein Lachen, dass die Kälte in New York erwärmen konnte. Es dauerte nicht lang, bis wir beide Gefühle entwickelten. Ich wusste nicht dass wir beide Dämonen haben, aber es ist schon lustig wie die Zeit alles offenbart. Du bist an dem Tag nicht nach Hause gekommen, als wir uns gestritten haben und meine Freunde sagten sie haben dich mit ihm gesehen. In der Bar in der wir uns getroffen haben, während ich in unserem Bett lag. Bist du dir im klaren darüber was du getan hast? Denn ich wollte nie dass es so endet, hier im Regen, in deinem schwarzen outfit. Komm, Erzähl mir was ich getan habe, dass ich das verdiene. Ich sag ja nicht dass wir perfekt waren. Ich hoffe eine Nacht mit ihm wars Wert. Mir zu erzählen es war ein Ausrutscher macht es nicht weniger schmerzhaft. Ich stehe hier, während du deine Gründe aufzählst und fühle mich wie ein trottel dir vertraut zu haben. Als ich mich umdrehe um zu gehen greift du nach meiner Hand und hältst mich fest. Deine Augen starren bedrückt zu Boden und du drehst dich um und sagst \"das ist nicht fair, es war nur eine Nacht ohne Gefühle\". Und ich guck in deine Augen und sage :ich wollte nie dass es so endet, hier im Regen, in deinem schwarzen outfit. Komm, Erzähl mir was ich getan habe, dass ich das verdiene. Ich sag ja nicht dass wir perfekt waren. Ich hoffe eine Nacht mit ihm wars Wert. Mir zu erzählen es war ein Ausrutscher macht es nicht weniger schmerzhaft. Ich weiß der Tag wird kommen, an dem es nicht mehr weh tut. Und all der Schmerz wird nur noch eine Erinnerung sein. Wenn ich stark genug war dich in mein Leben zu lassen, dann bin ich auch stark genug dich wieder hinaus zu lassen. Und ich hoffe, eines Tages wirst du jemanden finden der dich so liebt wie ich es getan habe. ich wollte nie dass es so endet, hier im Regen, in deinem schwarzen outfit. Komm, Erzähl mir was ich getan habe, dass ich das verdiene. Ich sag ja nicht dass wir perfekt waren. Ich hoffe eine Nacht mit ihm wars Wert. Mir zu erzählen es war ein Ausrutscher macht es nicht weniger schmerzhaft. So ungefähr 😅✌️",

  "\"Hurtless\" I remember the day that we met You were like a light I didn\u0027t know that I needed You had a smile that could warm up the New York cold It wasn\u0027t long till we both caught feelings I didn\u0027t know that we both had demons But it\u0027s funny how time reveals it all And you stayed out that night after we had a fight And my friends said they saw you with him At that bar where we met, while I\u0027m here in our bed Do you even regret what you did? \u0027Cause it was never meant to end like this Standing in the rain in your black dress So go ahead and tell me what I did to deserve this And I\u0027m not saying we were perfect I hope that one night with him was worth it But telling me that it was a mistake don\u0027t make it hurt less It don\u0027t make it hurtless I\u0027m standing there as you list off your reasons Made me feel like a fool for believing You reach for my hand as I turn to leave But you keep on holding on And your eyes started falling weighed down with despair And you turned around and said, \"This isn\u0027t fair\" It was only one night there were no feelings shared So I looked in your eyes and I said It was never meant to end like this Standing in the rain in your black dress So go ahead and tell me what I did to deserve this And I\u0027m not saying we were perfect I hope that one night with him was worth it But telling me that it was a mistake don\u0027t make it hurt less It don\u0027t make it hurtless I know the day will come when this won\u0027t hurt anymore And all the pain is just an afterthought If I\u0027m strong enough to let you in I can let you out again And I hope someday you\u0027ll find someone to love you like I did \u0027Cause it was never meant to end like this Standing in the rain in your black dress So go ahead and tell me what I did to deserve this And I\u0027m not saying we were perfect I hope one night with him was worth it But telling me that it was a mistake don\u0027t make it hurt less It don\u0027t make it hurtless It don\u0027t make it hurtless It don\u0027t make it hurtless",

  "Hurtless Lyrics [Verse 1] I remember the day that we met You were like a light I didn\u0027t know that I needed You had a smile that could warm up the New York cold It wasn\u0027t long till we both caught feelings I didn\u0027t know that we both had demons, but It\u0027s funny how time reveals it all [Pre-Chorus] And you stayed out that night after we had a fight And my friends say they saw you with him At that bar where we met while I\u0027m here in our bed Do you even regret what you did? [Chorus] \u0027Cause it was never meant to end like this Standin\u0027 in thе rain in your black dress So go ahead and tell mе what I did to deserve this And I\u0027m not sayin\u0027 we were perfect I hope that one night with him was worth it But tellin\u0027 me that it was a mistake don\u0027t make it hurt less It don\u0027t make it hurt less [Verse 2] I\u0027m standing there as you list off your reasons Made me feel like a fool for believin\u0027 You reach for my hand as I turn to leave But you keep on holdin\u0027 on [Pre-Chorus] And your eyes started fallin\u0027 way down with despair And you turned around and said \"This isn\u0027t fair It was only one night, there were no feelings shared\" So I looked in your eyes and I said [Chorus] It was never meant to end like this Standin\u0027 in the rain in your black dress So go ahead and tell me what I did to deserve this And I\u0027m not sayin\u0027 we were perfect I hope that one night with him was worth it But tellin\u0027 me that it was a mistake don\u0027t make it hurt less It don\u0027t make it hurt less [Bridge] I know the day will come when this won\u0027t hurt anymore And all the pain is just an afterthought If I\u0027m strong enough to let you in, I can let you out again And I hope some day you\u0027ll find someone to love you Like I did [Chorus] \u0027Cause it was never meant to end like this Standin\u0027 in the rain in your black dress So go ahead and tell me what I did to deserve this And I\u0027m not sayin\u0027 we were perfect I hope that one night with him was worth it But tellin\u0027 me that it was a mistake don\u0027t make it hurt less It don\u0027t make it hurt less It don\u0027t make it hurt less It don\u0027t make it hurt less",

  "Thank you so much for this song and everything! I\u0027m so proud of you. I really hope you read this because you really changed my life. I went through similar things as you did in this song and \u0027\u0027Be Alright\u0027\u0027 and I really wanted to give up, but your music helped me through so much. I was homeless and busking in the street from the age of 13 until I turned 17 and I listened to so many of your songs. It got me through the night and the day when I walked around the city with my headphones on. I was a runaway teen (home wasn\u0027t safe as the streets, that\u0027s all I\u0027ll say) and I just kept listening to your songs and it inspired me to write my own songs. Then I would perform them in the street for money to buy food. It eventually lead me to being discovered and now I have my own car and house at 19. I know I still got a long way to go, but your new release brought back memories when I listened to your last album walking around the city, wondering if I was ever going to be successful as you. Thank you Dean, thank you so much and I wish you a healthy heart and a lot more success. You deserve it.  - Kal Bear (Kal Wilkinson)",

In Poland, people say \"if you love her, let her go, if she loves you she will come back, if she doesn\u0027t come back, never was yours\" i associated these words with this song. it\u0027s beautiful, it\u0027s about love, suffering, about make mistakes, but also about giving a second chance ... maybe it\u0027s worth it. greetings from Poland 🇵🇱.",

When you released \"Be alright\" My boyfriend just broke up with me and I listened to your song the intire time.
