Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and in this way death spread to all men, because all sinned.😄😆 13 Because of sin the world was before the law, but sin is not imputed because there is no law. 14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of Adam\u0027s transgression, who is a type of Him who was to come. 18 For just as through one trespass judgment came upon all men to condemnation, so also through one act of righteousness the free gift came upon all men to justification of life. 21 That, just as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.",

Here, he\u0027s gotten Madonna to \"confess\", about herself and her stardom (of the 80\u0027s 90\u0027s), just like he did about himself in his song \"Starboy\" after overnight success/fame/wealth. The whole purpose is to confess, seek penance, and forgiveness, redemption, absolution. To come clean about the \"sins\" of the self (wrongs that they\u0027ve done or felt to THEMSELVES), show awareness and due diligence in accountability (of and to self), finding forgiveness of/from self (and/or from the public), in order to seek peace, strengthened will, reparations in relationships, family ties, and overall knowing the self (one\u0027s own identity). I.e., More better knowing, awareness, forgiving, and loving yourself, after going or having gone through dark times (intentionally or otherwise).  These songs aren\u0027t necessarily just for the public, directed toward others, or for entertainment purposes -- they are downright personal, like journals or diaries, that are about THEMSELVES! and directed to or ADDRESSING THEIR SELVES .. to achieve self awareness, do self evaluation, find redemption. through CATHARTIC CONFESSION. via semi-satirical art/song/music/expression. EXPRESS YOURSELF !!! Truly. \u003c3 U Madonna! (I was a teen in the 80\u0027s, and \"Open Your Heart\" \u0027s part of my carnal upbringing/knowledge, LOL. And I\u0027ll always love your first album and it\u0027s pure simplicity \u0026 clean production (jellybean!), and all the truly artistic songs \u0026 albums afterward, Oh Father\" always makes me cry, totally love \"Frozen\" and the collab with William Orbit was nice, and now here U are with this TRULY Fabulous STARBOY-in-his-own-heart, Abel Tesfaye).

Queen of Pop is her official title, but in weird alternate universes that houses the minds of people such as Lizzo who claim that Janet Jackson is the QoP, or someone else thinking Gaga is or Mariah is and so on and so on, then Madonna takes precedent, and claims her rightful place as The Empress of Pop in these alternate universes.  Pop Kingdom 101: Cher is the Grand Duchess of Pop. Then artists such as Kylie, Britney, Janet, Gaga, Katy, Taylor, Ariana.... they are all princesses. Janet being a princess of the blood as well. Aretha, Beyoncé \u0026 Nicki are all rightful Queens in their own right, just not of POP. Just like Micheal Jackson, their thrones are everlasting.",

  "You know, this song reminds me of my crush  Why? Cause once in music class the teacher let us pick a song to play and my crush chose this song  Just know he’s French, he knows English but not THAT well so yeah  And he’s Christian and saying a curse word is like really really really bad for him and there’s a bad word in this song well a couple  And so the next day at lunch, I told him there was some curse words in the song he chose and he told me to tell him what they were.  And me respecting that he’s Christian and not wanting to tell him cause he thinks it’s a sin or whatever, I asked him “you want me to say the curse words ?” And he was like “yeah ! Tell me”  He insisted and so I sat up straight and said “fvckin and  fvck” he looked at me like I killed his mother  I can’t explain the surprises look on his face and on my friend’s. No one has ever heard me swear before so this was a real surprise for them. My crush then put his hand over his mouth and I said “You told me to say them ! Don’t act so surprised “ and then he said “I didn’t think you would actually say them !-“ and yeah ... so this song just reminds me of his face looking at me like 🤭😦😧  Literally  Ps.

This song should not be praised at all. and I will come back to see if my comment is taken down. Aging gracefully is a thing. And madonna seemed to have figured out spirituality 20 years ago and has been regressing every since.

Real punk not eyeliner wearing, crying about relationships, caring more about clothes than my ex girlfriend does type music real music. Then one day i fell in love and my life has been ruined ever sense. Im now obsessed with this type of music. Never fall in love. I figured it was easier listening to his music instead of getting screamed at whenever i put mine on. Love make u do crazy things. Don\u0027t fall in love. I Ganentee you if your this obsessively in love with your partner odds are they aren\u0027t even close to being as in love with you as u are with them. Its always unbalanced. If u find yourself distancing, look at them and notice which one in the relationship is yearning more for the other. The only time its balanced is during great sex . Otherwise the rest of the time your just fighting for who gets to put their head above the water.",

  "@@thepassismyname4476 womb womp to all the souls who are trapped in hell? this is evil and you\u0027re saying womp womp. if someone got murdered you would say womp womp?",
  "@@AH-fm2ex If they are in hell they were bad people and I never said I would make fun on someone getting murdered you jumping to conclusions lil bro",
  "@@thepassismyname4476 im assuming you\u0027re a kid or a teenager. in that case, you don\u0027t know what hell actually is, which is the case for a lot of people actually. yes bad people go to hell, but so called \"good people\" go to hell too. that is because the literal definition of hell, according to the Bible is separation from god. that means if you don\u0027t accept Jesus\u0027 free gift of salvation or reject god, then you\u0027re going to hell. So even good people, who do good all their lives, don\u0027t hurt anyone, are nice, help the community etc whatever you definition of a good person may be can still go to god if they don\u0027t believe in Jesus. And believing in Jesus is step 1, step 2 is doing what he says, which includes not supporting this type of content, because how can you say you believe in someone but not do what they say? Imagine you\u0027re a musician in a band. You believe in your bandmate\u0027s musical talent and vision, but when it comes time to rehearse or follow through with the agreed-upon performance schedule, you don\u0027t show up or put in the effort. Your actions don\u0027t align with your belief in their abilities, causing confusion and frustration within the group. Similarly, saying you believe in someone but not following their guidance or instructions can create a disconnect between your words and your actions, leading to doubt and inconsistency in the relationship. believing in Jesus is just having a relationship with him, like a friend almost. it\u0027s not hard. he died on the cross for all of humanity\u0027s sin, like shown in this video, which is sin. That is why I don\u0027t support this type of content that also mock god. all you have to do is accept his free gift of salvation, which to me, sounds pretty easy.  murder is a sin, just like having false idols is a sin, which is the case here. For example, ,some idols include: Money, power, reputation, sex, appearance. A false idol is anything you place before God, anything you value more than him. These are all all sins, false idols and murder, so you saying womp womp is totally ignorant here.",

  "@@AH-fm2ex I believe you know what hell is right? Did you know not everyone is religious right? Now tell me whole point of hell if animals have to kill to survive i would like to hear that.Or the point of hell because somebody is born automatically with brain that makes that person do real bad stuff.Explain that maybe.What is so bad on this song anyway?? You probably didnt understood the lyrics so let me exaplain.This lyrics is about how people are able to sacrifice everything just to be seen and when the hell did he said its good? He makes more fun from it and if you have no clue about weeknd than you really shouldnt write comment like this.He even made fun of holywood about how they cant appriciate good artists and call them out so what you even talk about??? So if you gonna see dark art that represents artists mind you gonna be like *yeah thats devil and and its about programing you and its bad* bruh like wtf? You talk about sins there but seem to forget that if your ancestors wouldnt make those sins of killing something you probably i dont know WOULDNT BE ALIVE? MAYBE? Think about it rather than replying to me right away about how wrong i am because this is pure fact that history confirms",
  "@@gameshow4030 animals have to kill to survive, yes. but murder is killing someone without a valid reason. a lot of rappers rap about that and that\u0027s a sin. and also reading what you wrote makes me think you\u0027re also an kid or you just have a low IQ. again, a person born with a brain that makes them do bad stuff isn\u0027t the reason they go to hell. it\u0027s a rejection of god, it\u0027s not repenting for their sins, not repenting that they\u0027re bad person. you don\u0027t go to hell for committing sins, it\u0027s if you don\u0027t repent for your sins. \"Now tell me whole point of hell if animals have to kill to survive i would like to hear that.\" this sentence is extremely stupid, yes animals, including us if you think we\u0027re one but according to the Bible w\u0027re not actually, have to kill other animals to survive, but this isn\u0027t murder, and this has nothing to do with going to hell.

HE IS THE WAY,  THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE But you are deceived to believe the enemy can\u0027t give people things that are not of God (i.e. vanity)",

  "Then to add that she went on tour in 90\u0027 and did dick Tracy, then in 92\u0027 erotica came out along with body of evidence, then bedtime stories in 94\u0027. Evita in 96 and then in 98\u0027 ray of light, 00\u0027 music was released and a movie. I forget the title. She also did American pie by don mcclane. 03\u0027 me against the music with Britney and then her own album American life. Fast forward to 08 and she was on tour, and released an album. She only got old because she went mia for a few years after her 15\u0027 album was a flop. Not to mention her work with Nicki, album in 19\u0027 she was never considered old till recently bc she always was on top of her game. I know she injured herself on a horse and on stage at one of her shows. So where are you getting she was considered old in 89. She was 30 in 88. August 16th 1958",

The \"Kill anyone to be popular\" is them admitting to really killing people I\u0027m being 100% serious. Some not all of the celebrities and artists are satanists behind the scenes and they do some disgusting things. Things that would be unbelievable to you even it were true. Basically they rapr babies and children on a regular basis at their secret gatherings. I know it\u0027s hard to believe but just YouTube \"Ryan Garcia\". He\u0027s a famous professional boxer who just recently exposed the Illuminatti. He said they took him into some woods, tied him down and forced him to watch them rape a child. This was basically his initiation which he  obviously found disgusting. You honestly wouldn\u0027t believe the amount of people involved. Celebrities who you think are these great humans are actually sick, satanic, devil worshippers who kill people, their own members if needed, sex traffic babies and kids and rape and sexually assault them. The Weekend 100% and Illuminatti puppet and member. Again look how satanic his music and material is. Check out Ryan Garcia. Watch one video of him talking about what he went through and I guarantee you will start to see the signs of crazy things behind the scenes.",

  "The maya is supposedly there for entertainment.  Therefore, I think the third world is a good commentary.  It sometimes comes up with a lot of holy smoke and music.  But no one ever puts the music on.  That\u0027s it.  That\u0027s what it offers.  Zero.  It\u0027s like a mango seed.  Like the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi ranting and raving: zero.  \"Maybe there\u0027s something to be said for wild things\" is all I have to say about it, from its Pacific coast on in.

  "If you died today do you know if you\u0027d go to heaven? I beseech you not to ignore this message, where you spend eternity depends on it Gospel of Jesus Christ You must understand and accept that you are a sinner, as we all are \"FOR ALL HAVE SINNED, AND COME SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD.\" (ROMANS 3:23) \"AS IT IS WRITTEN, THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NO, NOT ONE.\" (ROMANS 3:10) The penalty for sin is the second death, which is an eternity in the lake of fire  — And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. (Rev 20:14) The good news is Jesus Christ paid the sin debt you owe so you don\u0027t have to spend eternity in the lake of fire. You must accept that Jesus Christ has already paid your sin debt \"FOR WHEN WE WERE YET WITHOUT STRENGTH, IN DUE TIME CHRIST DIED FOR THE UNGODLY.\" (ROMANS 5:6) \"BUT GOD COMMENDETH HIS LOVE TOWARD US, IN THAT, WHILE WE WERE YET SINNERS, CHRIST DIED FOR US.\" (ROMANS 5:8) Christ was not a sinner, and the Bible teaches that God took all of our sin and placed it on Christ. While Christ was bearing all of our sins in his own body, God punished him in our place to pay the sin debt that we owe. \"HE HATH MADE HIM TO BE SIN FOR US, WHO KNEW NO SIN; THAT WE MIGHT BE MADE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD IN HIM.\" (2 COR 5:21) The Bible says that Jesus \"WAS DELIVERED FOR OUR OFFENCES AND WAS RAISED AGAIN FOR OUR JUSTIFICATION.\" (ROM 4:25) You must believe what Jesus Christ did for you on the cross. The word believe means to trust, to depend on, to rely on. To believe on the Lord Jesus Christ means that you accept the fact that you are a sinner, that as a sinner you owe a sin debt, and that Jesus Christ died on the cross for all your sins on the cross, that he was buried and that he rose again to pay the debt you owe. \"THEREFORE BEING JUSTIFIED BY FAITH, WE HAVE PEACE WITH GOD THROUGH OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST: BY WHOM ALSO WE HAVE ACCESS BY FAITH INTO THIS GRACE WHEREIN WE STAND, AND REJOICE IN THE HOPE OF THE GLORY OF GOD.\" (ROM 5:1-2) \"IN WHOM (JESUS) WE HAVE REDEMPTION THROUGH HIS BLOOD, THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS, ACCORDING TO THE RICHES OF HIS GRACE.\" (EPH 1:7) If you trust what Christ did for you, you are redeemed, justified, forgiven. Jesus Christ did all the work for your salvation, you cannot work to keep it, and you cannot lose it. \"FOR BY GRACE ARE YE SAVED THROUGH FAITH, AND THAT NOT OF YOURSELVES, IT IS THE GIFT OF GOD, NOT OF WORKS, LEST ANY MAN SHOULD BOAST.\" (EPH 2:8-9) \"BEING JUSTIFIED FREELY BY HIS GRACE THROUGH THE REDEMPTION THAT IS IN CHRIST JESUS:\" (ROMANS 3:24) \"NOT BY WORKS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH WE HAVE DONE, BUT ACCORDING TO HIS MERCY HE SAVED US, BY THE WASHING OF REGENERATION, AND RENEWING OF THE HOLY GHOST; WHICH HE SHED ON US ABUNDANTLY THROUGH JESUS CHRIST OUR SAVIOR; THAT BEING JUSTIFIED BY HIS GRACE, WE SHOULD BE MADE HEIRS ACCORDING TO THE HOPE OF ETERNAL LIFE.\" (TITUS 3: 5-7) Today if you trust Jesus Christ, that he died for your sins, was buried and rose again, you are sealed for eternity \"IN WHOM YE TRUSTED, AFTER THAT YE HEARD THE WORD OF TRUTH, THE GOSPEL OF YOUR SALVATION: IN WHOM ALSO AFTER THAT YE BELIEVED, YE WERE SEALED WITH THAT HOLY SPIRIT OF PROMISE.\" (EPH 1:13) Get your eternal destiny settled today, trust in your heart what Jesus Christ did for you!",

  "@KG88KiteGodMusic 13 days ago I\u0027ll never forget the first time I heard this song. It was 1945, in a war-torn Germany. My family, barely making it through the hardships of World War II, found a moment of solace when this melody filled our humble home. It was more than just music; it was a miracle. As the notes played, something unbelievable happened. My grandmother, whom we had lost to the turmoil, was somehow brought back to life by its power. Today, she\u0027s not just with us…she\u0027s thriving as a successful software engineer and Dogsitter.",

  "1 Corinthians 15:1-4 Christ Died for our sins according to the scriptures, and that He was Buried, and that He Rose Again the Third Day according to the scriptures. Accept Christ as Savior and BELIEVE in Him and what He did for YOU at the Cross, God LOVES YOU so much that He gave His Only Son to Die for you so you can have Eternal Life Through Christ and have a Relationship with God The Father. We are living in the Final Seconds of the End of Days God told us about through the Holy Bible more than 2,000 years ago. The Dispensation of Grace we’re in is VERY QUICKLY Coming to an End, Christ is Coming back for us so much SOONER than any of us Think!!!. Give your Life to Christ Now while He may still be found because once the Rapture takes place, The Great Tribulation will immediately begin ( 7 years of unspeakable horrors ). Your Next Breath is NOT guaranteed, and if you die without getting Saved you will spend Eternity in Hell separated From God forever. Normal is NEVER coming back, but Christ is, Call on Him Today for He’s waiting for you with Open Arms and No Matter what  you’ve Done, God will Forgive you, the ONLY sin He won’t forgive is Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit ( Unbelief ). Christ is The Way, The Truth, and The Life, The ONLY WAY to The Father and The ONLY WAY to Heaven. If You were to die Today would you go to Heaven or Hell? Make the Right Decision Now for your Soul depends on it,DO NOT WAIT. Stay focused and Stay Planted in God for our Time on Earth is Almost Over, God Bless You all and get Right With God for we are going Home.",

  "I love it! And seeing the Madonna in such a beautiful 4k ultra HD clip delights me.  I\u0027ve been a fan of the Madonna since the very beginning, she was my first idol when I was 12 years old. I listened to confessions on a dance floor All the albums on repeat without getting tired (especially confessions and still today 😃 ). Then, it\u0027s a drop account. There have been some good and some bad (even very bad for me like ggw bi*h I\u0027m madonna that come to mind). Even if the albums are more generous in terms of the number of tracks, they are sometimes also less in terms of quality. M. also choked by all the international pop idol news that is a hit everywhere. And more and more every year. In recent years many of his singles have even gone unnoticed in France. You have to be a fan to follow his news. Even if France is his country of love, the French do not return him. At every concert in France, I am surrounded only by foreigners. You have to be bilingual. After that, it\u0027s also always the business and its arrogant ignorance of the most destitute fans that led us to put it aside a little and not listen as much as at the time (prices of boxes or concert tickets well placed) Also, we feel a bit lost by dint of hearing a sound that is always very different...",

J\u0027écoutais jusque confessions on a dance floor Tous les albums en boucle sans me lasser ( surtout confessions et encore d\u0027aujourd\u0027hui 😃). Ensuite, c\u0027est au compte goute. Il y\u0027a eu du  bon Comme du  mauvais (voir très mauvais pour moi comme ggw bi*h I\u0027m madonna qui me viennent en tête) . Même si les albums sont plus généreux en nombre de titres, ils sont parfois aussi moindre en qualité. M. aussi étouffée par toutes les nouvelles pop idol internationales qui cartonnent partout. Et encore de plus en plus chaque année. Ces dernières années beaucoup de ses singles passent même inaperçus en France. Il faut être fan pour suivre son actualité. Même si la France est son pays d\u0027amour, les français ne lui rendent pas. À chaque concert en France, je suis entouré que d\u0027étrangers. Il faut être bilingue. Après c\u0027est aussi  toujours le business et son arrogante ignorance des fans les plus démunis qui nous a un peu amené à la mettre un peu de côté et ne plus écouter autant qu\u0027à l\u0027époque (prix des box ou billets de concert bien placés) Aussi, on se sent un peu perdus à force d\u0027entendre un son toujours très différent...",

  "The Weeknd always gave me 80s/90s vibe with his singing style, which seemed fresh compared to a lot of his contemporaries all jumping on a modern style and sounding similar. So, it\u0027s not surprising he and Madonna sound good together. Playboi Carti is difficult to understand, I needed those subtitles. The lyrics are a bit repetitive, would love more verses. This reminds me of an Iggy Pop song about not wanting to date a 25 yr old. Makes me feel like you need to date more interesting chicks with depth and more intellect, at least the one the song\u0027s about is kinda boring to me. I know it\u0027s trying to reflect today\u0027s society but I\u0027d be more interested in that rare type of female who could teach you a thing about life and spirituality and love, lessons etc. I mean write a song about Madonna, she\u0027s actually more interesting than she lets on sometimes. Being a rebel and not caring about what ppl think, following your own path, the exact opposite of wanting to be popular. The tune is catchy though, a bop.",

Mick Jagger struts and gyrates   on stage in tight leather pants and Dolly Parton is in her 70s and sings the National Anthem in a skimpy cheerleading outfit and gets praised. Madonna always gets singled out being a \"granny\". It reeks of misogyny , ageism, and sexism. That\u0027s why she gives the middle finger in the video to all the haters and critics. Did she embarrass herself in the video? HELL NAH!! She ate that performance and left no crumbs and showed the world why she\u0027s a living legend!",
  "@tiffanimorris7127  it\u0027s not that, I love Madonna\u0027s music.  She is a legend.  But...  She\u0027s acting like she\u0027s thinks she\u0027s 20 in the video.  I don\u0027t mind her coming out in a suit or nice dress.   She is a legend but there\u0027s a time to give it up or at least act and dress within a decade of your age.  She\u0027s 66 screaming ultimate end life crisis.  I understand the leave her alone and let her be a legend attitude, she is superhuman, she looks great for her age, still has a good voice.  I\u0027m not denying any of that.  Again i say..She\u0027s a true legend.  The people backing her up love her like their own grandma, I get it, she\u0027s loved and has a a huge following.  She been doing this for 5 decades! But please don\u0027t come out in a 20 year old outfit and lay across the couch like that.  Less escort couch scenes, I want more of Madonna petting CGI tigers.  I don\u0027t think the men who are younger than 50 want to see that type of couch scene action.  In the video put her in a suit, be a ceo, be a boss, not an escort.  She deserves to be portrayed as a Queen in her videos, definitely not this.  Put some more money behind her video, you shouldn\u0027t cut budget on a living legend.",
  "@@dparky1 She is doing very Well. So you have material for tóxic critcs and ENJOY your poison",

While weeknd has a clear talent for hooks and flows, i am pretty sure this talent is able to be used due to the incredible production he has in each of his songs. what that comment insues is that metro and mike dean are both producers that not only grew and trained under the goat kanye, but they are quite litteraly able to carry any artist into mainstream ( which is not a bad thing, just like in F1, you need a good car to win, so im not discrediting weeknd, im simply putting way more importance on the producers )",

I say this with love and care, to seriously warn and wake you up, please take this message to heart!   Humans are spiritual beings, meaning they have a spirit which is inside their physical body, and when the person dies, their spirit leaves their body and that person either goes to Heaven or Hell, and my question to you is: If Jesus returns this day, where are you going to spend eternity? This is not religion or telling you to go to a local church, it\u0027s about a genuine connection and relationship with right standing before your Creator.",

It will take another 30 years for Beyonce, Rihanna, Lady Gaga and Taylor to earn that title. But the way it\u0027s going, it will be Taylor, who has won over 500 music awards already.  But Beyonce is the Grammy Queen, and Rihanna is pretty much the Dancing Queen, as her songs get played more often at dance clubs than any other female artist.

  "⁠​⁠@@gilbertokoxx3559Madonna ‘tangoes’  in the Buenos Aires scene in Evita. The ‘I’m Breathless’ album had the jazzy show tunes from Dick Tracy. (Hanky Panky and the Sondheim-penned stuff like Sooner or Later)  ‘Bedtimes Stories’ is an r\u0026b album. (‘Secret’ is the bluesiest though) I’ll have to check on whether she’s attempted actual blues-pop. I can’t see her doing it tbh.  Curiously I cannot think of a single rock song she’s done (except ‘rock versions’ she does on tour of songs like Hung Up. which are. Not great) even though when she was coming up she was called ‘rock star Madonna’ because rock was the all-encompassing category then like pop is now (a change that I’m sure has something to do with Madonna herself redefining what pop music meant.) Debut and True Blue probably have the most ‘rock’ vibes in songs like Gambler / White Heat. Anyway, it’s Madonna, you get a little bit of everything.",

She played a (simple) metal riff on one of her tours. The fun thing with Madonna is that it’s a very real possibility that she might get around to making a heavy metal song just for the hell of it.",

  "Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The world will soon fall into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it\u2028is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.       Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Get saved now before it’s too late! John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” Here are a couple links for further information. I am not affiliated with this website or ministry, they are simply tools that I think may help you!",

I just love his part for without it the song would be like some old RnB song, flat essentially, not that there\u0027s anything wrong with ol\u0027 skool. I love the modern feel he adds. So I understand that you might not like his raps or contributions to music. Consider that not all of us feel the same as you and it sucks to go on whichever celebrities page to find people like you always complaining for no apparent reason like someone forced you to be there. I understand that many of you are paid party-poopers too, always bashing and really just bullying celebs who put out music that people love. You\u0027re like a contradiction being here, you don\u0027t like #PlayboiCarti so why are you here? Or maybe you are Future still mad that your whack lyrics and bum flow tried to ruin /Double Fantasy/. (Thank God 🙌🏼 I found a way to skip his part whilst getting to enjoy that really dope song.) The only time Future made a good song was on \"working on the weekend like usual\". I stand by #PlayboiCarti, because he totally gets flack when the features I know are dope AF. I mean #LenarrYoung does many of his skits (\u0027cause of copy-strikes for other songs I guess) so you can be just as funny about your feels on your account. Knowing we will never feel the same, go find a creative way to express your feelings. If it\u0027s worth it you\u0027ll get some views so you can stop deterring other peoples\u0027 views without justification.",

  "All lives are precious so in any situation the gospel is needed: \"For God so loved the world that He gave his only Son that whosoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life.\" (John 3:16) God is just so because we broke his moral law by doing wrong against Him, ourselves and others, His punishment for sin is the death penalty. However He is also merciful which is why He gave Himself in human form (Jesus) to die for us, and take away our sins if we repent and believe in Him. If we do, our debt or bail is paid and we can go free. God is also merciful for those who have never heard the gospel and will judge them by their conscience, actions and belief in Him from evidence of creation.",

The rest of us remained stuck catching Top Forty countdowns on AM radio, or playing, on our parents’ imperial turntables, the one or two LPs in our possession. Increasingly, we listened to music by watching it on TV, our dance parties often overseen by a strutting, tattered sprite who wore bangles like opera gloves and held the camera’s gaze with her entire being, as though locked in a dare she was not going to lose.” — from The Meaning of Madonna by Michelle Orange, an article in The New Yorker After 40 years, Madonna has yet to lose that dare ❤️",

The way you drive into the paint and strike fear into our enemies eyes. Your amazingly lyrical bars, and those gorgeous ad libs. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you retire. You had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope. You are even amazing out of the studio, you\u0027re a great husband and father, sometimes I even call you dad. I forever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my own life if it were the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face. You ave given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember when you first left me and its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you get your first hit song, because deep down, my glorious king deserved it. WHÆ! I just wanted you to return home. Then allas, you did, my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced. 2015 was a hard year for us baby, but in 2017 you made history happen. You came back with Mongolia and I couldn\u0027t believe it. I was crying, bawling even, and I heard my glorious king exclaim these words, \"THIS IS FOR YOU!\" Not only have you changed the game of rapping and the world forever, but you’ve eternally changed my world. And now you\u0027re getting older, but still the goat, my goat. I love you pookie bear. WHÆ!",

Kanye? yes. drake? yes. weeknd? yes. lil yachty? yes. future? yes.

I mean if the only artists that u listen to are Taylor swift, tw and madonna, then I honestly dont expect u get what im saying. but u would see his influence if u listened to a couple of Kanye west, travis Scott, lil yatchy, young thug, drake, etc. songs..",
  "​@@anayrandhawa3007 You credit Carti excessively, and he seems to have lost his rapping skills. He borrowed the vamp style from SGP, and X executed screamo music more authentically. Carti seems to have lost his sense of fashion and resorted to wearing a dress. Carti\u0027s unique stolen vampire style was better than the leather jackets worn by homosexual biker gangs in the 80s. The quality of the material is evident on its own.",
  "@@ChatGPTbutithatesretardedhuman I honestly dont agree w u, even though I get what ur trying to say. it cant be called screamo music per se, although he seems to have taken inspiration from it, visible in wlr. he created his own version of it. he very subtly mixed rap with punk and rock, which isnt easy at all. but if we go to pre wlr era, ie die lit and self titled era, I dont see other rappers quite like him. his unique beats w baby voice and almost incomprehensible lyricism was unforeseen and it had a figurative domino effect, bringing out more artists like him. and he has very clearly not lost his rapping skills. if anything, hes grown through mixing the beats of the wlr era with unmatched bars, as seen in his 5 latest drops.  also, in his latest features of VULTURES 1(Kanye west and Ty Dolla collaboration album), he absolutely altered both the songs he was in, by changing their entire vibes. he seems to be fitting in with other rappers such as Kanye, travis, etc. much more. abt his fashion sense, u cant say hes lost it. I mean yes, he was wearing a dress-like cloth/trash bag in backr00ms, and shi. but this is more of a calculated decision to keep his \"aura\" as a vamp intact. he is making sure his supporters get the vibe hes tryna send, and its complemented by his clothes. It could also be a marketing strategy for his next album, which would get a lot more views and listeners, if he was in the headlines for this weird ass shit he wears, not that he needs the publicity,  his name is enough to bring out fans that have been waiting for the past 5 years (such as me).",

Madonna is such a huge cultural icon that her status alone and fame transcends the music industry. People know who she is even if they don’t listen to her music! Kids today aren’t aware of her importance and controversial past and how cool she was back in the 80’s and 90’s. …but they still know OF her.. sadly as an aging 67year old pop artist who makes very cringe tik toks.
