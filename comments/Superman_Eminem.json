  "📌📌\"Superman\" is a song by American rapper Eminem from his fourth studio album, The Eminem Show (2002), featuring guest vocals from his frequent collaborator, singer Dina Rae. Written by Eminem, Jeff Bass and Steve King, the song was released as the third single from The Eminem Show on January 21, 2003, in the United States only. It peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on the issue dated March 15, 2003, and received 2× Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Background \"Superman\" is about the rocky relationships and promiscuous nature of the girls Eminem has had in his life and how he plans to deal with it. In his 2008 autobiography, The Way I Am, Eminem revealed that the song is, to an extent, about his alleged relationship with Mariah Carey.[1] \"Superman\" is very similar to Eminem\u0027s song \"Drug Ballad\" and D12\u0027s song \"Pimp Like Me\". In a 2021 interview with Raaj Bundles of SideShowRaaj, Dina Rae revealed that Carey originally sung the hook for \"Superman\" before being replaced with herself, due to personal conflicts between Eminem and Carey.[2] Critical reception Entertainment Weekly editor described \"In the creepy-crawly, mesmerizing \u0027Superman\u0027, he depicts himself as both sexual predator and commitment-phobic single guy.\"[3] HipHopDX named the production \"the southern bounce\", lyrics as dealing with groupies and called the chorus \"cheesy\".[4] Steve Juon described the song\u0027s rap style: \"\u0027Superman\u0027 features Eminem playing with his flow in a stuttered cadence, but he\u0027s done the gimmick before and his beat on this one inspires only partial attention to his flow.\"[5] Rolling Stone concluded that his divorce fuels the slow Southern bounce of the hypermisogynist \"Superman\".[6]",

  "(a) What is a lesson plan? A lesson plan is a guide that teachers use to organize what they’re going to teach during a class. It’s like a roadmap that helps make sure lessons are clear, structured, and meet the learning goals for students. A good lesson plan breaks down what topics will be covered, how long each part will take, what materials are needed, and how the lesson will be delivered. It helps keep everything on track and ensures that the teacher knows what the objectives are for the lesson. (b) What are the parts of a lesson plan? A lesson plan typically includes several key parts: \t1.\tObjectives: These are the learning goals, basically what students should know or be able to do by the end of the lesson. \t2.\tMaterials: A list of everything needed for the lesson (textbooks, handouts, technology, etc.). \t3.\tProcedure: This is the step-by-step outline of how the lesson will be taught, including the introduction, main activities, and the conclusion. \t4.\tAssessment: How the teacher will check if students have understood the material (quizzes, discussions, assignments). \t5.\tTiming: A breakdown of how much time will be spent on each activity. \t6.\tReflection: Some lesson plans also include space for teachers to reflect on how the lesson went and what could be improved next time. (c) What are the types of lesson plan? There are different types of lesson plans depending on the purpose or style of the lesson: \t1.\tDaily Lesson Plans: These are the most common and cover what will be taught in one class period or one day. \t2.\tUnit Lesson Plans: These plans cover a longer time frame, like a week or a whole unit, and break it down into smaller lessons. \t3.\tActivity-Based Plans: Focus on hands-on activities or projects as the main way to teach the material. \t4.\tInquiry-Based Plans: These encourage students to ask questions and explore topics more independently, often used in science or research-based subjects. Each type of lesson plan is designed to meet different teaching and learning needs, but they all serve the same basic purpose of organizing and structuring the teaching process.",

  "(Pls complete reading) It\u0027s not allowed in many regions that the girl and the biy do what is you tried to show us It\u0027s unallowed in Islam Jaw Christianity It\u0027s dangerous to make family by that way ,In Islam, (complete reading pls even if you are not Muslim) anyone who commits this sin is stoned to death. Is this a frightening punishment, right? On the Day of Judgment (the Day of Resurrection) he will have a much greater punishment All this is the punishment of the Islamic religion only How to avoid falling into this act (For females) (It may protect you from R@pe) The first thing to cover  the body because immoral and dirty men look intently at the body and the question will be what areas should be covered Any area in the body should be covered except face and hands The second thing is to act sharply and not show any inclinations or coquetry outside the home. Immoral males are very attracted in this way Ok then how can mens avoid it The first thing you have to do is stay away from looking and talking, and even refrain from making friends with girls, and stay away from being friends with people who practice that Don\u0027t go to night clubs Don\u0027t crush on any girl and avoid looking at them as you can Do not watch romantic movies or any seductive scenes or scenes in which this kind of talk occurrence get close and pray to Allah (For Muslims only) Why this act is very very dangerous 1-if the girl got a baby then what could happen and what did the children do 2-if the man were irresponsible and escaped his responsibility to his child then the child would live without father 3-if anyone saw them (This is a big scandal) 4-if the boy took pictures of the girl and blackmailed her with them 5-if the boy r@pped the girl and escaped So stay away from this",

First thing you said: I\u0027m not faced; I hang around big stars all day. I don’t see what the big deal is anyway; you’re just plain old Marshall to me. Oh yeah girl run that game. Hailie Jade I love that name, love that tattoo what’s that say? Rot in Pieces, uh that’s great. First off you don’t know Marshall, at all so don’t grow partial that’s ammo for my arsenal. I\u0027ll slap you off that barstool; there goes another lawsuit. Leave handprints all across you. Good lordy wody you must be gone off that water bottle you want what you cant have oh girl that’s too damn bad don’t touch what you can\u0027t grab, end up with two back hands. Put anthrax on a tampax and slap you till you can’t stand. Girl you just ruined your chance, don’t mean to ruin your plans. But I do know one thing though bitches they come they go, Saturday through Sunday, Monday. Monday through Sunday yo. Maybe I\u0027ll love you one-day maybe we\u0027ll someday grow.

Sometimes I come back however many years it is later and watch all the same videos late at night all over again to recapture my youth and because these songs still and forever will bang.

  "Letra: Você está dopada amor? Sim Fale comigo Você quer que eu te diga algo?  Aham Eu sei o que você quer ouvir Eu sei que você me quer amor Acho que quero você também  Eu acho que te amo amor  Eu acho que te amo também  Estou aqui para te salvar garota Vem ficar no mundo do Shady  Quero crescer junto com você  Vamos deixar nosso amor rolar  Você sabe que me quer amor  Você sabe que te quero também  Eles me chamam de Superman  Estou aqui para te salvar  Eu quero te salvar garota  Vem ficar no mundo do Shady  Garoto você me deixa louca  Você me faz enlouquecer vagabunda  Eles me chamam de Superman Pulo por cima de todas as vagabundas num só pulo  Estou solteiro agora Tô sem aliança nesse dedo agora Nunca vou deixar outra mina me pisotear  Num relacionamento, fica quieta vadia, quer me vigiar? Você me enoja  Superman não vai aguentar porra nenhuma Garota, você pode pular no pau do Shady Seja direta, vá direto ao assunto Eu falo na cara de uma filha da puta  Sem brincadeira, não diga nomes  Desde que eu quebrei a cara daquele...Como é o nome dele mesmo? Sou um homem diferente  Beija minha bunda  Beija meus lábios, por que perguntar vadia?  Beija meu pau, pega minha grana  Eu preferia que você me espancasse Não dá o fora? Eu te boto pra fora  Não vai sair? Eu te empurro pela saída  Te quero, atiro em tudo, não mijaria no fogo pra apagar você  Eu sou bom demais? Compro gelo pra você?  Vagabunda, se você morresse Não compraria uma vida pra você  O que você tá tentando ser? Minha nova esposa? Qual é você é Mariah? Passe duas vezes Mas eu sei de uma coisa Vadias vem e vão Sábado até domingo  Segunda até domingo  Talvez eu amarei você um dia  Talvez cresceremos juntos um dia  Até lá senta sua bunda bêbada  Naquela porra de pista vagabunda  Porque eu não posso ser seu Superman Não posso ser seu Superman  Não posso ser seu Superman  Não posso ser seu Superman  Eu não posso ser seu Superman  Não posso ser seu Superman  Não posso ser seu Superman  Seu Superman  Seu Superman  Não me entenda mal, eu amo essas putas  Não é segredo, todo mundo sabe  Sim nós transamos, e daí vadia? Talvez é até ai que seu parceiro chega  Seremos amigos, te ligarei de novo  Eu irei atrás de você em todos os bares que você atende  Nunca sei em que carro estarei dentro Veremos o quanto você vai estar se divertindo  Você não quer isso, nem eu  Eu não quero ficar revoltado quando te ver com rapazes Muito orgulho, entre você e eu  Não sou um homem ciumento, mas fêmeas mentem  Mas eu acho que é isso que vagabundas fazem Como poderá algum dia ser só nós dois? Eu nunca te amei o suficiente pra confiar em você A gente acabou de se conhecer e eu já te comi Mas eu sei de uma coisa  Vadias vem e vão  Sábado até domingo  Segunda até domingo  Talvez eu amarei você um dia  Talvez cresceremos juntos um dia  Até lá senta sua bunda bêbada Naquela porra de pista vagabunda  Eu sei que você me quer amor Eu acho que quero você também  Eu acho que te amo amor  Eu acho que te amo também  Estou aqui para te salvar garota  Vem ficar no mundo do Shady  Quero crescer junto com você  Vamos deixar nosso amor rolar  Você sabe que me quer amor  Você sabe que te quero também  Eles me chamam de Superman  Estou aqui para te salvar  Eu quero te salvar garota  Vem ficar no mundo do Shady  Garoto você me deixa louca Você me faz enlouquecer vagabunda  Primeira coisa que você fala  Não sou aborrecida Eu fico perto de famosos todos os dias Eu não vejo nada de mau nisso  Você é apenas o Marshall pra mim Garota brinca mesmo  Hailie Jade  Eu amo esse nome  Amo esse tato O que tá escrito? \"Apodreça em pedaços\" Nossa isso é demais Primeiramente você não conhece o Marshall De jeito nunhum, não faça pela metade Isso é munição para o meu arsenal  Eu te derrubo com um tapa dessa cadeira de bar  Ai vai outro processo  Deixo minhas marcas da mão tudo em você  Meu Deus do céu  Você deve ter saído  Das garrafas d\u0027água  Você quer o que não pode ter  Garota, isso é uma pena  Não toque no que não pode pegar Acaba com as mãos tortas  Põe Anthrax num Tampax E te dou tapas até não aguentar mais  Garota, você acabou de perder sua chance  Não queria estragar seus planos   Mas eu sei de uma coisa  Vadias vem e vão  Sábado até domingo  Segunda até domingo  Talvez eu amarei você um dia  Talvez cresceremos juntos um dia Até lá senta sua bunda bêbada  Naquela porra de pista vagabunda  Eu sei que você me quer amor  Eu acho que quero você também  Eu acho que te amo amor Eu acho que te amo também Estou aqui para te salvar garota  Vem ficar no mundo do Shady  Quero crescer junto com você  Vamos deixar nosso amor rolar  Você sabe que me quer amor  Você sabe que te quero também  Eles me chamam de Superman  Estou aqui para te salvar  Eu quero te salvar garota  Vem ficar no mundo do Shady  Garoto você me deixa louca  Você me faz enlouquecer vagabunda",

Also stupid Katy Perry brought Kristi Klienbeck with her too. 🙄 If you only knew how much I hate them 🤬. Some people do know tho. Katy Perry is a very evil person and I never wanted to sleep with her. Also Kristi\u0027s government friends are now preaching at the Church i grew up going to. I believe the last time i was with Kristi was Cardi\u0027s wedding thing is i thought i was with Dua Lipa 💔 but it was Kristi Klienbeck the stupid lady who cursed me to hurt my kids she didnt approve of in Preschool. Which means any of them that are not hers or Amber a bitch she helped tricked into marrying by Amber and Charles aka my a**hole brother. Also I thought I was with my parents also. Cause my biological father said we are going. But i thought i was with my parents but i wasn\u0027t. Turns out I got brought there by Kristi\u0027s adoptive parents.i thought i was hanging out with Dua but I wasn\u0027t with Dua it was Kristi? If i remember correctly i thought Dua was Kristi. Didn\u0027t figure it out until somebody ask why are with her she cursed you to hurt my kids. What ever tho turns out i was with the the idoit that cursed me. I thought i came with my parents too nope i was her adoptive parent which Mr. Klienbeck was my 5th grade teacher that psychology assaulted me all my 5th grade year. And they were right i was with the b*tch!",
  "Are... You okay?",
  "@jonathanholmhansen2106  getting there just got a lot to go through. My biological mother drugged my whole life. Now, I\u0027m dropping the world on her head, and her and my biological father are not able to deal with it. Also, the man responsible for Kristi being in my life is the preacher at their church, and he took his orders from his wife, and they ain\u0027t able to handle it either. My biological father got a restraining order on me after role playing when the current president got one on me. He wanted me to go to jail for assaulting a b politician (Joe Biden), who was assaulting Ashley his own daughter, My biological parents preachers wife got one on me to which includes the church building I grew up going too.  God hasn\u0027t forsaken me only my biological parents and their wannabe preacher, also Kristi Klienbeck too.",

[Дина Рей] Ага… [Eminem:] Я знаю, что ты хочешь услышать. Потому что я знаю, ты хочешь меня детка, я думаю, я тоже тебя хочу… [Дина Рей] Я думаю я люблю тебя малыш… [Eminem] Я думаю я люблю тебя тоже Я должен спасти тебя здесь девочка, Заходи в мир Шейди Я хочу кончить вместе, Давай позволим нашей любви развернуться Ты знаешь, что ты хочешь меня, детка, Ты знаешь, что я тоже хочу тебя Они называют меня суперменом, Я должен спасти тебя здесь Я хочу спасти тебя, девочка, Заходи в мир Шеди [Дина Рей] О парень, ты сводишь меня с ума. [Eminem] Сука, меня от тебя тошнит. [Eminem] Они называют меня Суперменом Невероятный прыжок в холостятском сингле, Теперь я одинок, И нет теперь на моем пальце кольца Я никогда не позволю какой-нибудь соплячке сбить меня В отношениях, усвой это, сука, нянчиться? Я устал от тебя, Супермен не спасительное дерьмо Девочка, ты можешь прыгнуть на ч*ен Шейди Прямо из бедра — отрезок преследования Я говорю этой шлюхе прямо в лицо Не играй ни в какие игры, не называй никаких имен С тех пор как я прекратил с тем, что является ее лицом Я разносторонний человек, поцелую мою задницу Поцелую мои губы, сука, чего еще спрашиваешь? Поцелуй мой ч*ен если получишь мои деньги Я бы лучше сделал так, чтобы ты отхлестала мою задницу Не ставь целей, я их растрою Ты не победишь, я выпихну тебя Киска сдует попсовое дерьмо Я слишком хорош, чтобы купить твой лед? Сука, если ты умрешь, сможешь ли купить себе жизнь Что ты сделаешь, чтобы стать моей новой женой? Что за Мария? Лети отсюда! Хотя я знаю одну вещь Суки, они приходят и приходят С субботы по воскресенье, понедельник С понедельника по воскресенье Может быть, я буду любить тебя один день Может быть, мы когда-нибудь кончим А пока сидит только твоя пьяная задница На этой долбаной взлетно-посадочной полосе, oу [Припев] Поэтому я не могу быть твоим суперменом, Не могу быть твоим суперменом, Не могу быть твоим суперменом, Не могу быть твоим суперменом, Я не могу быть твоим суперменом, Не могу быть твоим суперменом, Не могу быть твоим суперменом, не могу быть твоим суперменом [Eminem] Не поймите меня не правильно, Я люблю все это И это ни какая не тайна, Каждый знает Да, мы трахались, Сука, так что с этого? Это то время, пока не появился твой приятель Мы будем друзьями, Я позову тебя снова Я буду преследовать тебя около каждого бара, в которые ты заходишь Никогда не узнаешь, в какой машине я буду Посмотрим, как долго ты будешь веселиться тогда Ты не хочешь этого, тогда не доводи меня Я не хочу выходить из себя, когда я вижу тебя с парнями Слишком много чести для тебя. Я Не ревнивый человек, но ложь женщин Я думаю, что только шлюхи так делают Как могло нас быть когда-то только двое? Я никогда не любил тебя достаточно, чтобы доверять тебе Мы только встречались и я только трахал тебя Хотя я знаю одну вещь Суки, они приходят и приходят С субботы по воскресенье, понедельник С понедельника по воскресенье Может быть, я буду любить тебя Может быть, мы когда-нибудь кончим А пока сидит только твоя пьяная задница На этой долбаной взлетно-посадочной полосе, oу [Eminem] + (Дина Рей) Припев 2Х [Eminem] Я знаю, что ты хочешь меня, детка, Я думаю, что я тоже хочу тебя [Дина Рей] Я думаю, я люблю тебя, детка [Eminem] Я думаю, что я тоже люблю тебя Я должен спасти тебя здесь девочка, Заходи в мир Шейди Я хочу кончить вместе, Давай позволим нашей любви развернуться Ты знаешь, что ты хочешь меня, детка, Ты знаешь, что я тоже хочу тебя Они называют меня суперменом, Значит, я должен спасти тебя здесь Я хочу спасти тебя, девочка, Заходи в мир Шейди [Дина Рей] О, парень, ты сводишь меня с ума [Эминем] Сука, меня от тебя тошнит [Эминем] Первая вещь, которую ты говоришь… [Эминем в роли женщины] Меня это не волнует Я кручусь вокруг больших звезд целый день Я не вижу то, что большая сделка будет так или иначе Ты всего лишь простой старый Маршалл для меня [Эминем] Ооо, девочка, давай сыгрем в эту игру Хейли Джейд? Мне нравится это имя! Люблю эту татуировку, что это за слово? «протухни по кускам» о, это замечательно [Эминем] Сначала ты не знала Маршалла При этом все не останутся равнодушными Это патрон для моего арсенала Я пришью тебя около того же бара Там идет еще другой судебный процесс Остались отпечатки поперек тебя везде Хороший леди-води** ты должна вытечь, Как бутылка с водой Ты хочешь иметь то, что не можешь иметь О, девочка, это так чертовски плохо Не прикасайтесь к тому, чего не можете получить Разберитесь с двумя ударами слева На тампаксе разместился фурункул И против удара ты пока не можешь устоять Девочка, ты только упустила свою возможность Не хочешь, чтобы нарушали твои планы? Хотя я знаю одну вещь Суки, они приходят и приходят С субботы по воскресенье, понедельник С понедельника по воскресенье Может быть, я буду любить тебя Может быть, мы когда-нибудь кончим А пока сидит только твоя пьяная задница На этой долбаной взлетно-посадочной полосе, oу [Eminem] + (Дина Рей) Припев 2Х [Eminem] + (Дина Рей) Я знаю, что ты хочешь меня, детка, Я думаю, что я тоже хочу тебя Я думаю, что я тоже люблю тебя Я должен спасти тебя здесь девочка, Заходи в мир Шейди Я хочу кончить вместе, Давай позволим нашей любви развернуться Ты знаешь, что ты хочешь меня, детка, Ты знаешь, что я тоже хочу тебя Они называют меня суперменом, Значит, я должен спасти тебя здесь Я хочу спасти тебя, девочка, Заходи в мир Шейди [Дина Рей] Oоо, парень, ты сводишь меня с ума [Эминем] Сука, меня от тебя тошнит",

  "Ugh I am just amazed at how you can find multiple meanings to his lyrics. So brilliant!!! Neitzsche would\u0027ve loved his writing. I do think this song was inspired from Nietzsche\u0027s philosophy of ubermensch and duality of nature. Although Neitzsche preaches for the qualities of an ubermensch he does also encourage people to be skeptical of his teachings and to practice critical thinking and be skeptical of traditions/ideologies/beliefs. Always approach life by the scientific method and don\u0027t be life\u0027s bitch. If you replace bitches with life, it makes so much sense. The fame and loss will come and go. Love will come and go. Existence will come and go. He\u0027s not superman nor is any religious figure. Don\u0027t be life\u0027s bitch because life/ego/existence is not your savior. Death is an inevitable part of life. Therefore, the meaning of good and evil is only existent in the perspective and experience of humanity\u0027s ego. We are all conditioned from birth to be who we are. So, learn to go with the tao and enjoy the music (life). There is no one answer to life. There is one answer to your own life. Duality and contradictory nature of life. Yin and Yang.",

Many even mock Christians, mock them, but they are on the right path. God left the Bible, which is his written word, so that all who believe should not perish, but have eternal life. Come to Jesus beloved, read the Bible. One day we will all be judged by God about everything that is written in it.📗🥵😰",

  "Atualmente, estou chorando tanto agora. Esta é seriamente a história mais bonita e bem montada de todos os tempos. Eu não posso acreditar como foi mágico 2:18. Essa parte realmente me fez derramar uma lágrima. E especialmente em 0:45 essa parte foi tão verdadeiramente tocante que palavras não podem descrever a série de emoções que senti. Eu simplesmente amei o clímax, tinha detalhes insanamente excelentes. Ah, e não podemos esquecer a conclusão. A conclusão foi a maior e mais triste conclusão que já vi, melhor do que qualquer um dos livros que li. Muito obrigado por criar esta obra-prima absoluta. Esta é essencialmente a obra-prima mais importante da história do cinema. É uma tragédia que isso, não pode ser chamado de filme, mas uma experiência emocional transcendente, seja inacessível para a maioria. Ele encapsula lindamente a luta humana em seus fundamentos; sofrimento, prazer, fé, desespero. Ele se conecta com os personagens dentro dos espectadores, indivíduos reprimidos em nosso próprio subconsciente. Ele permanece vibrante, fresco e revoluciona a arte de contar histórias e fazer filmes, ao mesmo tempo em que faz uma declaração sobre o que significa ser humano. Divertido, emocionante e simplesmente emocionante. Esta pode ser a obra de arte mais impactante que já encontrei em minha vida e definitivamente voltarei a ela em um futuro próximo para estudá-la mais profundamente. esta é uma obra-prima absoluta, fui levado às lágrimas ao ouvir isso e ver o chip girando em um círculo inúmeras vezes. absolutamente comoveu minha alma, e acho que nunca mais poderei ser o mesmo. este bacon mudou todo o meu estado mental, agora estou em paz com quem eu sou e o que farei mais tarde na minha vida. perdoei todos os meus inimigos e agora sou um homem de vida pacifista. Vou seguir em frente, tenho que seguir em frente, como diz a música. o chip é tão inspirador, ele compartilha sua vasta sabedoria com todos nós, e todos nós somos tão sortudos que ele nos concederia suas grandes palavras. somos todos crianças em chip. granizo ficha. granizo ficha . O chip girando, girando em uma direção com essa música... Isso me fez chorar. Como esse bacon pode fazer uma coisa dessas? Estou impressionado com esta obra-prima. Especialmente quando o chip gira, mostrando sua pele amarela levemente coberta de sal. Eu posso ouvir o barulho daqui, assim como o belo som da lasca raspando no chão de veludo escuro e liso. O sabor, a música e tudo pode ser ouvido, provado, visto e sentido de uma tela. Você pode realmente ouvir as respirações entre o artista da música, empatizando seu amor por este chip rotativo. Verdadeiramente o que eu chamo de arte moderna. Esta foi a performance mais lendária de qualquer pedaço de chip que eu já assisti. A atuação foi de primeira linha e mudou muito a vida. Este é um dos melhores trabalhos de um pedaço de chip que eu já vi, especialmente em 57:42. No momento, estou chorando muito agora. Esta é seriamente a história mais bonita e bem montada de todos os tempos. Eu não posso acreditar como foi mágico em 1:12. Essa parte realmente me fez derramar uma lágrima. E especialmente às 6:34 essa parte foi tão verdadeiramente tocante que as palavras não podem descrever a série de emoções que senti.

Chorei, bati e também assisti a um filme enquanto assistia a essa estreia. Isso tem me feito passar por tanta coisa. Passei pela depressão por causa disso. Isso realmente me inspirou a me tornar um jovem notável. bem satisfeito como chip.",

  "Он поет о том, как после развода с женой больше не доверяет женщинам, как они ему безразличны и он их теперь будет только тр@хать, никаких серьёзных отношений, это если в общем) а вообще-второй куплет создан из названий других песен, это так круто",

  "ТЕКСТ  Русский перевод Ты уже в полете, девчонка? Еще как... Даа... Скажи мне что-то Хочешь мне что-то сказать Ага... А я знаю что ты хочешь услышать...   Я знаю что ты меня хочешь, девчонка, кажется и я тебе хочу \"Мне кажется я тебя люблю\"... и я тоже тебя люблю... Я здесь чтобы спасти тебя, девочка, добро пожаловать в мой мир. Я хочу чтобы мы шли вперед вместе, давай дадим нашей любви раскрыться... Ты знаешь что ты хочешь меня, девочка, и ты знаешь что я тоже тебя хочу, Меня называют Суперменом, я тут чтобы спасти тебя... Я хочу тебя спасти, побудь в моем мире. \"Ооох, ты меня сводишь с ума\", сучка ты меня взводишь...   Меня называют Суперменом, я прыгаю через высоких сучек одним прыжком, И теперь я один, на этом пальце уже нет кольца, Больше я не дам ни одной девушке меня загрузить в отношениях... Да не надо... иди лучше побудь бэйбиситером, ты мне надойдаешь, Супермен ничего не прячет, ты только можешь попрыгать на моем члене, Сразу все прямо, я тебе скажу все без никаких, я скажу любой сучке в лицо: Не играй игр, не бросайся именами, с тех пор как я разбил лицо той... как ее там Я другой человек, поцелуй меня в жопу, или поцелуй в губы, но без лишних вопросов Поцелуй мне член, возьми мои деньги, я предпочту чтоб ты меня побила по попке. Если не не дашь, я тебя выброшу, если ты не уйдешь - вытолкну, Все может лететь к чертям, а я даже не пописаю на тебя если ты загоришься огнем, Может я слишком добр - я покупаю тебе кок, но если бы ты сдохла, копейки бы не дал за твою жизнь. Что, ты пытаешься стать моей новой женой? Что, ты Мария? Ага, лети как фанерка!   Но во всяком случае я знаю одно: сучки, они приходят и уходят С субботы до воскресения, и с воскресения до субботы, блин Может ты мне понравишься один белый день, может когда то из нас что-то выйдет, А до тех пор иди посиди на бордюре, бухая.   Потому что я не могу быть твоим Суперменом, Не могу быть твоим Суперменом...   Не поймите меня неправильно, я люблю таких сучек, Это не секрет, всякий знает, Да, мы поебались, девка, ну и что с того, на большее я и не замахиваюсь Ладно, будем дружить, я тебе буду звонить, буду ехать за тобой по барам А ты никогда не будешь знать в какой я машине, тогда посмотрим как ты потанцуешь Ты ведь этого не хочешь, и я не хочу, я не хочу злиться когда ты будешь с кем-то другим Слишком много уважухи между нами Я не ревнивый, но сучки врут. Да, так наверное себя и ведут сучки, как мы вообще сможем быть только один с другим Я тебя никогда так не полюблю чтобы верить тебе, ведь мы только что встретились, а я уже тебя трахнул.   На это ты говоришь: \"Я не опрокинулась, я кручусь около звезд каждый день, Я не понимаю в чем вся проблема, Для меня ты просто Маршалл\" Ага, девка, крути эту шарманку, \"Хэйли Джейд, классное имя,  \"Согнись к черту\"? О, это тоже классно.\" Во-первых, ты Маршалла совсем не знаешь, так что не строй из себя Меня это только злит, я тебя ударю так что ты слетишь со стула Вот черт, будет новый иск в суд, я ведь оставил на тебе отпечатки где хошь Даа... ты наверное полетела от простой воды... Ты хочешь то, что не не можешь иметь, ох, девка, тебе же хуже Не трогай то, что не можешь схватить, а то кончишь совсем без рук Я насыпаю антракса на тампакс и хлестану тебя так что ты не сможешь встать Девка, ты прямо сейчас потеряла свой шанс, извини, я не хотел портить тебе планы",

Quando foi perguntar-lhe o que estava acontecendo com a cidade de Nagasaki, encostou lentamente no ombro da pessoa, mas antes que pudesse perguntar, a pessoa virou-se bruscamente e começou a tossir sangue. Algo estava errado, os olhos da pessoa estavam totalmente brancos, sem íris, nem pupila. Ágata saiu correndo porém sua prima Saori não teve a mesma sorte, pois tropeçou e foi alcançada, mi, re, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, re re, fa, mi  o que está acontecendo e dividirei em dois onde vocemessê nunca irá encontrar! Ou melhor, se quiseres entender como viver feliz e o que aconteceu em Nagasaki antes de eu chegar aqui? ? ? ? ? O que são humanos?

Aokigahara é conhecida por ser um lugar comum de suicídios. Anualmente, são encontrados cerca de cem corpos humanos, muitas das vezes, cadáveres e uns corpos que já viraram esqueletos. Se, somente se Ágata encontrar as duas partes da lenda, saberá o que fazer 55 hs. . . . . . Lembro-me agora. Eu estava em um tiroteio, algo assim. Mas o que faço nessa sala escura? Posso ver um frecha de luz, trata-se de uma porta entreaberta. Ao sair da sala, vejo um corredor com paredes que um dia já foram brancas. No final do corredor, à esquerda, há uma escada pela qual desço. Ela gira em torno do edifício em que estou e em cada andar que desço há uma janela de um lado para o outro sem um destino. E, depois de poucas semanas, já havia 5. D. Does he want more tea? E. Does it rain every day? ? ? ? ? ? O que são humanos?

  "Cê tá dopada, querida? Sim Sim? Hahaha, fale comigo Você quer que eu te diga algo? Uh huh Eu sei o que você quer ouvir Porque sei que você me quer, querida Eu acho que quero você também Eu acho que te amo, querida Eu acho que te amo também Estou aqui para te salvar, garota Vem ficar no mundo do Shady Quero crescer junto com você Vamos deixar nosso amor rolar Você sabe que me quer, querida Você sabe que te quero também Eles me chamam de superman Estou aqui para te salvar Eu quero te salvar, garota Vem ficar no mundo do Shady Ooh, garoto você me deixa louca Você me faz enlouquecer, vagabunda Eles me chamam de superman Pulo por cima de todas as vagabundas num só pulo Estou solteiro agora Tô sem aliança nesse dedo agora Nunca vou deixar outra mina me pisotear Num relacionamento Fica quieta vagabunda, quer me vigiar? Você me enoja Superman não vai agüentar porra nenhuma, Garota você pode pular no pinto do Shady Seja direta Vá direto ao assunto Eu falo na cara de uma filha da puta Sem brincadeira Não diga nomes Desde que eu quebrei a cara daquele como é o nome dele mesmo Sou um homem diferente Beija minha bunda, beija meus lábios, porque perguntar vagabunda? Beija minha pica, pega minha grana, Eu prefiro que você chicoteie minha bunda Não dá o fora? Eu te boto pra fora Não vai sair? Eu te empurro pela saída Te quebro, atiro em tudo Não mijaria no fogo pra apagar você Eu sou bom demais? Compro gelo pra você? Vagabunda se você morresse, não compraria uma vida pra você O que você tá tentando ser, minha nova esposa? Qual é você é Mariah? Passe duas vezes Mas eu sei de uma coisa Vagabundas vem, e vão Sábado até domingo, segunda até domingo mano Talvez eu amarei você um dia Talvez cresceremos juntos um dia Até lá senta sua bunda bêbada naquela porra de pista, vagabunda Porque eu não posso ser seu superman,não posso ser seu superman Não posso ser seu superman, não posso ser seu superman Eu não posso ser seu superman, não posso ser seu superman Não posso ser seu superman Seu superman, seu superman Não me entenda mal (Eu amo essas putas) Não é segredo, todo mundo sabe Sim nós transamos, e daí vagabunda? Talvez é até ai que seu parceiro chega Seremos amigos Te ligarei de novo Eu irei atrás de você em todos os bares que você atende Nunca sei em que carro estarei dentro Veremos o quanto você vai estar se divertindo Você não quer isso Nem eu Eu não quero ficar revoltado quando te ver com rapazes Muito orgulho, Entre você e eu Não sou um homem ciumento, mas fêmeas mentem Mas eu acho que é isso que vagabundas fazem Como poderá algum dia ser só nós dois? Eu nunca te amei o suficiente pra confiar em você A gente acabou de se conhecer e eu já te comi Mas eu sei de uma coisa Vagabundas vem, e vão Sábado até domingo, segunda até domingo mano Talvez eu amarei você um dia Talvez cresceremos juntos um dia Até lá senta sua bunda bêbada naquela porra de pista vagabunda! Porque sei que você me quer, querida Eu acho que quero você também Eu acho que te amo, querida Eu acho que te amo também Estou aqui para te salvar, garota Vem ficar no mundo do Shady Quero crescer junto com você Vamos deixar nosso amor rolar Você sabe que me quer, querida Você sabe que te quero também Eles me chamam de superman Estou aqui para te salvar Eu quero te salvar, garota Vem ficar no mundo do Shady Ooh, garoto você me deixa louca Você me faz enlouquecer, vagabunda Primeira coisa que você fala \"Não sou aborrecida, eu fico perto de famosos todos os dias Eu não vejo nada de mau nisso, você é apenas o marshall pra mim\" Ooh yeah garota brinca mesmo \"Hailie jade, eu amo esse nome amo essa tattoo, o que tá escrito? Apodreça em pedaços, nossa isso é demais\" Primeiramente você não conhece o marshall de jeito nenhum Não faça pela metade Isso é munição para meu arsenal Eu te derrubo com um tapa dessa cadeira de bar Ai vai outro processo Deixo minhas marcas da mão tudo em você Meu Deus do céu você deve ter saído das garrafas d\u0027água Você quer o que não pode ter Ooh garota isso é uma pena Não toque no que não pode pegar Acaba com as mãos tortas Põe Anthrax num Tampax (absorvente) e te dou tapas até não aguentar mais Garota você acabou de perder sua chance Não queria estragar seus planos Vagabundas vem, e vão Vadias elas vêm elas vão Sábado até domingo, segunda até domingo mano Talvez eu amarei você um dia Talvez cresceremos juntos um dia Até lá senta sua bunda bêbada naquela porra de pista Porque sei que você me quer, querida Eu acho que quero você também Eu acho que te amo, querida Eu acho que te amo também Estou aqui para te salvar, garota Vem ficar no mundo do Shady Quero crescer junto com você Vamos deixar nosso amor rolar Você sabe que me quer, querida Você sabe que te quero também Eles me chamam de superman Estou aqui para te salvar Eu quero te salvar, garota Vem ficar no mundo do Shady Ooh, garoto você me deixa louca Você me faz enlouquecer, vagabunda Porque eu não posso ser seu superman,não posso ser seu superman Não posso ser seu superman, não posso ser seu superman Eu não posso ser seu superman, não posso ser seu superman Não posso ser seu superman Seu superman, seu superman",

[Дина Рей] Ага… [Eminem:] Я знаю, что ты хочешь услышать. Потому что я знаю, ты хочешь меня детка, я думаю, я тоже тебя хочу… [Дина Рей] Я думаю я люблю тебя малыш… [Eminem] Я думаю я люблю тебя тоже Я должен спасти тебя здесь девочка, Заходи в мир Шейди Я хочу кончить вместе, Давай позволим нашей любви развернуться Ты знаешь, что ты хочешь меня, детка, Ты знаешь, что я тоже хочу тебя Они называют меня суперменом, Я должен спасти тебя здесь Я хочу спасти тебя, девочка, Заходи в мир Шеди [Дина Рей] О парень, ты сводишь меня с ума. [Eminem] Сука, меня от тебя тошнит. [Eminem] Они называют меня Суперменом Невероятный прыжок в холостятском сингле, Теперь я одинок, И нет теперь на моем пальце кольца Я никогда не позволю какой-нибудь соплячке сбить меня В отношениях, усвой это, сука, нянчиться? Я устал от тебя, Супермен не спасительное дерьмо Девочка, ты можешь прыгнуть на ч*ен Шейди Прямо из бедра — отрезок преследования Я говорю этой шлюхе прямо в лицо Не играй ни в какие игры, не называй никаких имен С тех пор как я прекратил с тем, что является ее лицом Я разносторонний человек, поцелую мою задницу Поцелую мои губы, сука, чего еще спрашиваешь? Поцелуй мой ч*ен если получишь мои деньги Я бы лучше сделал так, чтобы ты отхлестала мою задницу Не ставь целей, я их растрою Ты не победишь, я выпихну тебя Киска сдует попсовое дерьмо Я слишком хорош, чтобы купить твой лед? Сука, если ты умрешь, сможешь ли купить себе жизнь Что ты сделаешь, чтобы стать моей новой женой? Что за Мария? Лети отсюда! Хотя я знаю одну вещь Суки, они приходят и приходят С субботы по воскресенье, понедельник С понедельника по воскресенье Может быть, я буду любить тебя один день Может быть, мы когда-нибудь кончим А пока сидит только твоя пьяная задница На этой долбаной взлетно-посадочной полосе, oу [Припев] Поэтому я не могу быть твоим суперменом, Не могу быть твоим суперменом, Не могу быть твоим суперменом, Не могу быть твоим суперменом, Я не могу быть твоим суперменом, Не могу быть твоим суперменом, Не могу быть твоим суперменом, не могу быть твоим суперменом [Eminem] Не поймите меня не правильно, Я люблю все это И это ни какая не тайна, Каждый знает Да, мы трахались, Сука, так что с этого? Это то время, пока не появился твой приятель Мы будем друзьями, Я позову тебя снова Я буду преследовать тебя около каждого бара, в которые ты заходишь Никогда не узнаешь, в какой машине я буду Посмотрим, как долго ты будешь веселиться тогда Ты не хочешь этого, тогда не доводи меня Я не хочу выходить из себя, когда я вижу тебя с парнями Слишком много чести для тебя. Я Не ревнивый человек, но ложь женщин Я думаю, что только шлюхи так делают Как могло нас быть когда-то только двое? Я никогда не любил тебя достаточно, чтобы доверять тебе Мы только встречались и я только трахал тебя Хотя я знаю одну вещь Суки, они приходят и приходят С субботы по воскресенье, понедельник С понедельника по воскресенье Может быть, я буду любить тебя Может быть, мы когда-нибудь кончим А пока сидит только твоя пьяная задница На этой долбаной взлетно-посадочной полосе, oу [Eminem] + (Дина Рей) Припев 2Х [Eminem] Я знаю, что ты хочешь меня, детка, Я думаю, что я тоже хочу тебя [Дина Рей] Я думаю, я люблю тебя, детка [Eminem] Я думаю, что я тоже люблю тебя Я должен спасти тебя здесь девочка, Заходи в мир Шейди Я хочу кончить вместе, Давай позволим нашей любви развернуться Ты знаешь, что ты хочешь меня, детка, Ты знаешь, что я тоже хочу тебя Они называют меня суперменом, Значит, я должен спасти тебя здесь Я хочу спасти тебя, девочка, Заходи в мир Шейди [Дина Рей] О, парень, ты сводишь меня с ума [Эминем] Сука, меня от тебя тошнит [Эминем] Первая вещь, которую ты говоришь… [Эминем в роли женщины] Меня это не волнует Я кручусь вокруг больших звезд целый день Я не вижу то, что большая сделка будет так или иначе Ты всего лишь простой старый Маршалл для меня [Эминем] Ооо, девочка, давай сыгрем в эту игру Хейли Джейд? Мне нравится это имя! Люблю эту татуировку, что это за слово? «протухни по кускам» о, это замечательно [Эминем] Сначала ты не знала Маршалла При этом все не останутся равнодушными Это патрон для моего арсенала Я пришью тебя около того же бара Там идет еще другой судебный процесс Остались отпечатки поперек тебя везде Хороший леди-води** ты должна вытечь, Как бутылка с водой Ты хочешь иметь то, что не можешь иметь О, девочка, это так чертовски плохо Не прикасайтесь к тому, чего не можете получить Разберитесь с двумя ударами слева На тампаксе разместился фурункул И против удара ты пока не можешь устоять Девочка, ты только упустила свою возможность Не хочешь, чтобы нарушали твои планы? Хотя я знаю одну вещь Суки, они приходят и приходят С субботы по воскресенье, понедельник С понедельника по воскресенье Может быть, я буду любить тебя Может быть, мы когда-нибудь кончим А пока сидит только твоя пьяная задница На этой долбаной взлетно-посадочной полосе, oу [Eminem] + (Дина Рей) Припев 2Х [Eminem] + (Дина Рей) Я знаю, что ты хочешь меня, детка, Я думаю, что я тоже хочу тебя Я думаю, что я тоже люблю тебя Я должен спасти тебя здесь девочка, Заходи в мир Шейди Я хочу кончить вместе, Давай позволим нашей любви развернуться Ты знаешь, что ты хочешь меня, детка, Ты знаешь, что я тоже хочу тебя Они называют меня суперменом, Значит, я должен спасти тебя здесь Я хочу спасти тебя, девочка, Заходи в мир Шейди [Дина Рей] Oоо, парень, ты сводишь меня с ума [Эминем] Сука, меня от тебя тошни",

That girl was a freak Of freaks I think I ask her marry me like three times that night. But boy she was a coke head. I mean don’t get me wrong it was nice but that chick actually stayed in my house for 2 weeks laying out by the pool walking around naked before she back to LA. Best two weeks of my life.

  "COVIDNINETEEN VACINATIONS, THE 1ST STEP TOWARDS THE MARK OF THE BEAST IS HERE SOON. A great and formidable enemy seeks to enter into the very blood of My children through the altering of your DNA. Because of the curse that came about after the fall of the first man Adam, I came to make a way for you. You are renewed and made clean again by your belief and salvation in Me, your King and Messiah, sent by My Father to redeem you by My blood sacrifice on the Cross of Calvary. Only through Me, the Door, corruptible is made incorruptible, unredeemable made redeemable. I have ransomed you in order to bring creation back to its Creator. Creator YHWH was made flesh to overcome death, hell, and the grave, and to take what was tainted and impure and make it whole again. The spiritual battle that is raging now is ultimately to strip you of the Divine image of Myself that has been placed within the DNA of My creation. Ask Me for more wisdom and revelation about this and it will be given to you. The veil was torn, access granted when I shed My blood, died and rose again. We have created you in Our image, and when you walk in holiness, righteousness and purity, obeying My commandments, I am enthroned on your heart. You are then transformed in body, soul and spirit. When this transformation occurs, the very frequency of your cells then resonates with Me and raises you closer to your Creator and further away from the lower realm and lower frequencies which keep you bound. This is by design, and when indwelled, My Holy Spirit will be the gatekeeper of your heart, and your entire being, My sanctuary, and the place where I reside in you. When this occurs, My Kingdom is on earth, as it is in Heaven. It is then that I am able to provide victory over the curse for you, preserving the Divine design I have placed within your DNA. There are many layers of revelation to know what is coded there and hidden, secrets to be revealed to only those who overcome. However, if the gates are breached by sin, lack of obedience, compromise, or lukewarmness, the enemy sets up thrones (strongholds) instead of Me, because my laws, My Word have not been written on your hearts. You have a sworn enemy whose utter mission is to destroy you. He will stop at nothing, and as My Word has foretold, the time is here when the greatest of all violence and evil against My people, those made in My image, is taking place. The battle is for the soul, and the battle is about the blood. Satan’s ultimate goal from the beginning was to corrupt the seed, corrupt the blood that carries My blueprint in you, My design for those made in Our image, your DNA. There is only one way to ensure that My Throne is upon your heart and your eternal destination is sealed, or your soul will be lost forever. Your must be born again. Your heart must be sealed with My blood. You must be quick to repent often and seek holiness above all else. Love what is true and just. Be extremely careful what your eyes see and your ears hear. This is guarding your heart, guarding its gate. It is in sealing these portals to the soul, in commanding the spirit to govern or have mastery over the soul, that you overcome. You will then be prepared for My return, and be protected from the evil one. If you have not already done so, seal the portals to the enemy now! Confess your sins and repent for the midnight hour is here! Bind the access points that have given satan legal rights within your temples, within your body, mind, soul and spirit. Give satan and all his dark kingdom a certificate of divorce and be free from the bondage, and from all the oppression and possession in your bloodline immediately! Break the curse from your ancestors back to Adam. Cover it all with My blood and command the enemy out of your bloodline, sealing it as well, the gates to your heart, using the authority you have been given through Me. Exercise dominion as a gatekeeper and a son or daughter of the Most High God, taking your positions as heirs to My Kingdom. My Holy Spirit will then have permission to use you for My glory and manifest through you in this crucial hour. *(Please see the prayers on the right hand side bar and the one titled Increased Demonic Warfare Prayer covers everything He is instructing here)* This must be done this moment!! This is crucial! Precious moments remain before the implementation of the enemy’s plan to destroy the DNA of My creation, making you forever unredeemable. The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and it must be taken by force! Take My Holy Word and dispossess what has had control of your gateways and that of your family line through covenants, oaths, soul trades and agreements made by your ancestors. Do it this moment! In Me you will be made FREE! The implementation of the plans to alter your DNA and make it programmable by something other than Me, your Creator, are here. I control and govern the DNA I have placed within you, but if you allow man to administer anything within your bodies, that will recode your DNA, I will no longer be the controller. I will no longer recognize you as My creation. You will have become a mixture of something else, an altered form of man and technology, and therefore, not in My image any longer. Do you understand what I am saying? Truly the hour is here when you must prepare to make the choice to remain fully human, infused with My Spirit. The enemy wants nothing more than to deceive you through propaganda, fear and manipulation and cause you to allow either a mark or an implant (vaccine or digital tatoo) into your bodies that will forever separate you from Me. This is your reality right now! You must know what you will choose to do. When you open doors to the enemy through sin and through your choices in life outside of My ways, the demonic spirits appoint gatekeepers over your heart, your mind, and your soul. Then those spirits invite more, and when no repentance occurs, strongholds occur. The heart of an unregenerate man is wicked and deceitful above all things. But My Word is quick, powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing apart of your soul and spirit, your joints and marrow, as I discern the thoughts and intentions of your heart. Allow Me to write My laws on your heart and you will know truth at last. You will know what is now directly in front of you and the choices that are here for you and your loved ones. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, but it does NOT have to be this way. Allow My glory to penetrate your spirit so that your soul will come under submission. To not allow this, means you will remain in bondage and you will be easily deceived. If I do not dwell in you fully, and your gates have been breached, another will easily influence you and take governance. My people, I have given you the keys to the Kingdom. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven and whatever is loosed on earth will be loosed in Heaven. Bind the strongman, bind the strongholds on your life and be delivered! The technology for the mark of the beast is here. It is upon you. It will be presented at first to be taken voluntarily, then very soon after, you will not be able to buy, sell or work. Do not wait another moment. Come out of Babylon and make Me King of your heart, the Divine Gatekeeper of your soul. The evil ones have set in motion their wicked schemes, as it must be so according to My Word. Many, many judgments will occur as I allow them. This is to wake up My church. You must know where you stand in your walk with Me, because in an instant, everything will change, and there will not be another opportunity to choose, because the choice will be made for you. You are either all in, or I am turning you over to your carnal mind and nature. You have the choice My loves, choose life and eternity in Me over eternal death in darkness.The time is now.  YAHUSHUA, JESUS THE CHRIST.  108",
  "🍒🍒judgment that is not physically, mentally, and  spiritually beneficial is useless therefore has no true value. Without judgment progress cannot be made. For no one can express or receive love or any other desired emotion in its entirety if the don\u0027t know themselves. We are all not created equal however we all have a equal obligation to living up to the pleasure, potential, and responsibility of femininity and masculinity. So do your best to become physically fit, mentally sound, and spiritually balanced being able to express physical freedom. Which can be accomplished through clean air, water, fitness, and high sources of nutrition organic and non-genetically modified would be best.  Plus formal education or real hands-on experience.     When one learns the body\u0027s capabilities and limitations by fully engaging with all their  senses to their extreme limits in the most efficient way that is humanly possible. The subconscious then begins to naturally subconsciously systematically coincide with the mind-body souls  spirit mother Earth and all the various different forms of life that live within this world and the most efficient way that is humanly possible.  Thus yielding the best spiritual kickback for one\u0027s efforts accomplishments experiences.    You might want to take these points to heart              Considering the simple logic if life is not free, why the hell would death be any cheaper? It\u0027s not the question the common, basic, average, normal man or woman may be able to wonder is what is the spiritual cost to one\u0027s own soul and spirit for freely living dying off having only used the smallest percentage of a fraction of the true potential they are first born with.   Not to add insult to injury for the last hundred and 50 years or so the mass majority of the population has been living and dying yielding the worst spiritual kickback that has ever been manifested since the beginning of life only getting worse. And that has nothing to do with everybodys so-called charming personality and everything to do with the standards of quality pertaining to our air, water, foods, landscapes, working/living environment, every day home products, habitats, and ecosystems. Which is ignorant beyond retarded (no offense to any disabled people.) When you consider for the last 490 years Give or take we have had the manpower woman influence or vice versa   to have created clean high paying jobs from coast-to-coast globally that would improve upon and maintain the quality of our life in such a manner.                That the mass majority of the population from coast-to-coast globally would naturally, gradually, and systematically start becoming stronger, smarter, healthier, happier, better off physically, mentally, and financially possibly spiritually then the previous generation.   Now I would like to resurrect the wish and prayer I made prior to my 8th birthday which was to be held spiritually accountable to the statements I proclaim to the way I\u0027m living personally and professionally. I guarantee you never see or hear another body, man or woman in power, persons of legal, religious authority, or leaders ever freely validate the statements they proclaim with that level of certainty one reason they don\u0027t have the best interest of the majority of the population\u0027s needs at heart a another reason could be they cum   from a bloodline of cowards or simply have a lifestyle that suggests, confirms, and validates them as being feebleminded physically inadequate submissive subservient which it doesn\u0027t get any worse than that. One is genetically inherited and the other is a simple generic learned behavior. Quite possible to be a combination of these worst-case scenarios nonetheless either way it is physically, mentally, and spiritually useless to freely live and die in such a low quality manner.            Especially if that ignorant stupidity, weak, lonely desperation  stems from being soft, lazy, out of shape, over fed, undernourished, overworked, and underpaid with a dirty low-paying job that comes from outdated power sources, inferior materials, poisonous, toxic substances, pesticides, and chemicals that never change their killing composition. Which means simpletons whether it is a solid, liquid, or burnt off into our airways atmosphere as a vapor it is always going to be poisonous, debilitating, and deadly to the body at the same time polluting, corrupting, and devastating to mother Earth and all the various different forms of life that live within this world. There is no cash profit to be made in the demise of the planet. Thanks to those dirty low-paying jobs we are in the mist of environmental financial global collapse.  The good news souls and spirits have paid out are picking up the tab on the end results of those dirty low-paying jobs.   The even better news that the common, basic, average, normal man woman may be able to comprehend his souls and spirits have been are being managed, directed, maintained, and implemented with all the disease, sickness, illness, pain, suffering, injury, abuse, neglect, hunger, addiction, sadness, anger, and hyper- aggressive violence. That has been allowed to occur manifesting throughout the history of mankind into what it is today thanks to people like Donald Trump who have the false belief if the mass majority of the population is at their worst they will feel   less afraid inferior to the true potentials of love, honor, and the creation of life.   Here\u0027s the deal you\u0027re either part of the world solutions or exacerbating the planets problems there is no safe in between. Either way no matter how you look at it each and every moment of every life has been spiritually accounted for. S.R.F.",

  "Beni arzuladığını biliyorum bebeğim, sanırım ben de seni arzuluyorum (Sanırım seni seviyorum bebeğim) Sanırım ben de seni seviyorum Seni kurtarmak için buradayım kızım, gel Shady\u0027nin dünyasına Birlikte büyümek istiyorum, bırak aşkımız yelken açsın Beni istediğini biliyorsun bebeğim, benim de seni istediğimi biliyorsun Bana Superman derler, seni kurtarmak için buradayım Seni korumak istiyorum kızım, gel Shady\u0027nin dünyasına Ooh beni baştan çıkartıyorsun çılgın şey, sürtük midemi bulandırıyorsun [Verse 1] Bana Superman derler, tek bir zıplayışta sürtüklerin üzerinden atlarım, bekarım şuan da Parmağımda yüzüğümde yok şu an, asla bir pilicin beni devirmesine izin vermem Bir ilişkideyken, kurtar bunu sürtük, bebek mi bakacaksın? Beni hasta ediyorsun Superman aslında bir bok kurtarmaz, bunun yerine kızım Shady\u0027nin sikine zıplayabilirsin Doğrudan kalçadan geliyorum, bu lafı sikik bir orospuya söylerim yüzüne karşı Oyun oynamam, isim söylemem, onun suratıyla ilişkimi kestiğimden beri Ben farklı bir adamım, kıçımı ya da dudaklarımı öp? Sürtük neden soruyorsun ki? O zaman sikimi öp, paranı al? Sana kıçımı kırbaçlattırmayı tercih ederim aslında Devrilmeyeceğim, ben seni devireceğim, asla kovamayacaksın, ben seni kovacağım Amın söndü, haplar ağzında, ateşe işemezdim bile seni kurtarmak için Çok mu şekerim? Sana buz mu alayım? Sürtük ölsen bile sana hayat bahşetmezdim Yeni karım mı olmaya çalışıyorsun? Mariah mısın? Benim yanıma iki kez uçtun [Nakarat] Ama yine bir şey bilirim, sürtükler gelip giderler Cumartesiden Pazar\u0027a ve Pazartesi\u0027ye, Pazartesi\u0027den de Pazar\u0027a, yo Belki bir gün aşık olurum sana, belki bir gün büyürüz O zamana kadar ayyaş kıçını sikimden uzak tut Çünkü senin Superman\u0027in olamam, Superman\u0027in olamam Beni yanlış anlamayın, bu orospuları cidden seviyorum, bu bir sır değil, herkes biliyor Sikişmiş olabiliriz, ee sürtük nolmuş yani, bu vücudunun hissedebileceği en uç nokta Arkadaş oluruz, seni tekrar ararım, gittiğin her barda peşinde olacağım Nasıl bir araba da olacağımı asla bilemezsin, işte o zaman ne kadar parti yaptığını göreceğiz Bunu istemiyorsun, bende öyle, seni erkeklere görünce keçileri kaçırmak istemiyorum Çok fazla gururluyum, bu senin ve benim aramda, kıskanç bir adam değilim ama bayanlar hep yalan söyler Ama sanırım sürtükler de böyle yapıyor, sadece ikimiz nasıl olabilirdik ki? Seni asla güvenecek kadar çok sevmedim, biz sadece tanıştık ve sadece seni siktim [Nakarat] [Nakarat II] [Verse 3] İlk olarak böyle diyeceksin, (Ürkmedim bile, her gün büyük yıldızların etrafındayım Asıl mesajı hala anlayamadım bile, sadece bana eski Marshall\u0027ı oynuyorsun) Ooh evet, sürdür bu oyunu, (Hailie Jade, bu ismi sevdim, dövmeyi de sevdim, ne yazıyor orada? \"Huzur içinde çürü\", aa bu harika) İlk olarak Marshall\u0027ı cidden tanımıyorsun, her şey bu kadar, taraflı bakış açısı yok İşte bu benim mühimmatım cephaneliğim için, seni tek bir tokatla bar koltuğundan indireceğim Yeni bir dava başlayacak, her tarafında parmak izimi bıraktım Yüce tanrım, pislik içindesin, içki şişesinden sağ olarak çıkmışsın Elde edemeyeceğin bir şeyi istiyorsun, ooh kızım bu çok berbat Erişemediğin ciğere mundar olma, elimin iki tersiyle koyarım sana Bir pede şarbon koyarım ve seni tokat manyağı yaparım Kızım az önce şansını boşa harcadın, planlarını bozmak istemem",

  "I can recall the very first time I heard this really HURTIN\u0027 tune ; where I was n exactly what I was doin\u0027 . He\u0027s the five star GENERAL , just like that animated insurance commercial  , And of course , this crunchy WORDSMITH , with many talents , see his GENIUS cutting through , he\u0027s the CAPTAIN CRUNCH .... this feisty dude is the COSMIC  SWORDSMITH .                YO       You see he is THE MARSHALL , too ... if he can\u0027t do it  ....? .... you best believe ,  NOBODY can ... nobody , nobody , nobody CAN .     There he is , our SUPERHERO , he\u0027s OUR SUPERMAN , OUR SUPERMAN .      AND One of the GREATEST OF ALL TIME , but he aint sheisty , even when he\u0027s          Slim Shady , he\u0027s The Shepherd of our CRAZY kind , and oversees the herd .     M n M , in All His Infinite Wisdom truly understands the INTRINSIC and EXQUISITE value of        THE WORD ... and the CRISPY CRITTER who speaks SO CLEARLY knows how to make his thoughts n voice be HEARD .       And  please do think about THIS n THAT basic QUALITY -- you know , is actually REQUISITE .... in his line of work.     Don\u0027t you silly little ants act like prissy nerds .                   I AM      SHE OF MANY NAMES              but call me        Philly Phranciepantz .                   NOW         Right  now it\u0027s goin\u0027                  DOWN                     And                      all         mumble-jumblers                     you                   know       you can do so much                   better   just take those              dirty digits                   stick        them in your   MOUTH    n  pull         the    SHIT       out .     At one time I thought maybe there was HOPE for you , that you could       sing   SCAT . andthat\u0027       REALLY WHERE IT\u0027S AT        Haven\u0027t figured him out yet ? he\u0027s       THE CAT IN THE HAT !      THE CAT IN THE HAT !      THE CAT IN THE HAT !   I tell you why DOC D    I have to leave and run now ;  I\u0027m having TOO MUCH FUN NOW ... listening to music that fills me with natural MAGNETIC ECSTASY , Saturday through Sunday Monday Monday to Sunday , yo .    I\u0027m off to find more of my long lost friends , so I\u0027ll be traveling through n popping up in various vids , but I don\u0027t yet know what I\u0027ll do say or do .     I am the next WHERE\u0027S WALDO ? So catch me if you can .... like the GOAT Footed Balloon Man , I sing a gleeful wEEeeeee ... and Marshall Mathers , hold up !           ..... wait a second here .... I just heard someone smugly say in  their stupid arrogance , like a prissy bitch I don\u0027t listen to rap only classic rock .     Man , what a crock . _________________________ I finished this several hours ago I\u0027m sorry now I have to go I was hungry and decided to eat and even threw in something sweet but then I became lethargic while digesting my food .      I even had a touch of garlic to Keep the vampires away , Away , while Hearing in my head Bela lugosi\u0027s dead but I couldn\u0027t play no Bauhaus because I really thought that I had what it takes to finish this little project .     ... so then I played with the cats little lady Wu-Tang , Windsor , he\u0027s my teddy Windsor wah ,  just like I said last night... so I was chilling with them and \u0027Gyptian ... he looks like one of those Egyptian cats but his extraction is from China . He has the biggest eyes , green shiny pools , originally I named him Anubis , but he simply would not respond .     You know the funny thing about him , though , something about him reminds me of Snoop Dogg .... you heard me sing it last night. BowWow wow yippy yo kaiyay  Bow Wow .     the whole time I was making food and even while I ate it .... the stories were flying in my head I have no way to beat it  .    This rhyming thing people say it is a gift and a blessing .... sometimes one cannot shut it down even if you are down on the ground and the cops are telling you to put your hands behind your back , now hold up for a minute , like the castle  jewelry heist ... picture if he had a touch of that just like Dr . Seuss\u0027s CAT IN THE HAT , I just want you to THINK ABOUT THAT .      and then I could not find the phone ,  after I found it , I couldn\u0027t find the notebook .... after I found the notebook I couldn\u0027t find the charger ... after I found the charger I could not find my cell phone again , my friend .... sometimes I have days and nights like ... sort of like Frampton\u0027s \" COME ON , LET\u0027S DO IT AGAIN \" ... believe it or not now I\u0027m ready for bed I even slept late , which I hate to do .      Sometimes I go in circles and don\u0027t know what I\u0027m looking for .... and other times I hear you knocking at my door you\u0027re you\u0027re saying can\u0027t you hear Can\u0027t You Hear Me Knocking on your door Can\u0027t You Hear Me Knocking on your window  .... Can\u0027t You Hear Me Knocking ,whoeho oh .... so will it go round in circles will it fly high up in the sky this thing that I am always looking for .... or is it just a circle game the seasons they go round and round .... yesterday a child came out to wonder , caught a dragonfly in a jar .... fearful when the sky was full of thunder , cheerful at the falling of a star . For Jaco Pastorius Talent shooting through the universes , but like Mark Twain going out on the tail of a comet ,  it just makes me want to vomit one such talent goes unnoticed , unmarked and yet he was so remarkable lit from within by that SACRED SPARK .       I\u0027m not sure what is on the ROOTS CHANNEL because I\u0027m fading fast , but everyone should go there to learn of MUSICS\u0027 past ..... she is the Empress of all time when you get there you have reached the highest Realm and been GIFTED by the gods ,  by the way what is this G-D NONSENSE .... say what you mean , mean what you say , one thing leads to another ...  it\u0027s getting rough , off the cuff ,           I have to say         enough\u0027s enough ... you twirp !  ... you can\u0027t     sayGod ?!  IF .IT   means    something else  ,    please enlighten me .  I\u0027m getting undressed taking off my psychedelic colored fake fur vest .      So now I\u0027m in the shower  . it is The Golden Hour when the youngest kids go to bed ... and all are sleepy heads .      ( but not golden showers , you pervs out there ... somewhere , Over the Rainbow way up high.... I sang that song to my Golden Child when when he was an infant  ..... he didn\u0027t seem to like it much , not even for an instant  .      But when I sang Amazing Grace he always had such a peaceful happy face .    but Nothing Gold Can Stay ..my  son he was a handsome man . before he got dragged down by the stone of the people who put on a happy face ,  so when he turns his backs on them they get the chance to put the knife in my baby\u0027s ,  baby back baby back ribs , making MY SON harvest  what THEY have SOWN ... but what I want really want to know is how do you like your blue-eyed boy ,                    MR .                 \" work   them to their       DEATH \"           . so now it is 12:32 a.m. I don\u0027t know how I made it this long enervated ,tired but feeling strong .     Well now you probably know somehow my other name is Jabberwocky Jabberjaw and I drive people crazy I drive them nuts with my crunchy style , for I too am a crispy critter .      but I am no Cap\u0027n Crunch being Catholic Irish on my father\u0027s side I would say more like Lucky Charms hope you find me magically delicious when you eat my words ... my daddy his name was Joe we come from the House of Pain ,  and just like Regis Philbin , he was always at his best when he was watching Notre Dame  .       I\u0027m getting really sleepy yo ,  there\u0027s a cop outside he\u0027s double-parked I have no idea why maybe he\u0027s just chilling and taking a break this section here always has a good vibe maybe that\u0027s what drew him near .       my dad and Regis had another thing in common they both had class and didn\u0027t pull their punches but that is a story for another day and if you couldn\u0027t tell by now then I will tell you all by myself ,        my other name is        SCHEHERAZADE and I have   CHEATED                    DEATH   but that\u0027s a story for another day but before pack it up , pack it in , let me begin  because where I     begin is where       I end ...  you sleep on it , just before you sleep on it you might just want to jump around , Jump Around  ,  Get Up , Stand Up , I\u0027m laying in the bed , I see you dancing on the ceiling ......   but that\u0027s a story for another day ...... and like fauda and like Fat Albert from Philadelphia           HEY HEY HEY             NA NA NA        We\u0027re Gonna Have             A Good Time .        And i feel real good ,                   really good because              i always do            my very BEST .           Remember , folks      A JOB WELL DONE    IS IT\u0027S OWN REWARD .",

Like all great rappers and singers, Eminem only raps and sings about the emotions he has at those times. The songs are like diaries for him. It\u0027s all his ways of making sense out of everything he feels.",

Кажется, я тоже хочу тебя…[Dina Rea:] Кажется, я люблю тебя, малыш…[Eminem:] Кажется, я тоже люблю тебя… Я здесь, чтобы спасти тебя, детка… Добро пожаловать в мир Шейди! Я хочу, чтобы мы были вместе, Пусть наша любовь распустится, подобно цветку! Ты знаешь, что хочешь меня, детка, Ты знаешь, что я тоже хочу тебя. Меня называют Суперменом, Я здесь для того, чтобы спасти тебя. Я хочу спасти тебя, девочка, Добро пожаловать в мир Шейди![Dina Rea:] О, малыш, ты сводишь меня с ума![Eminem:] Су*а, меня от тебя тошнит…[Eminem:] Меня называют Суперменом, Потому что я тра*аю красивых тёлок по нескольку за раз. Теперь я холостой, Как видите, кольца на безымянном пальце у меня нет. Я больше ни одной тёлке не позволю взять надо мной верх В отношениях. И хватит нянчиться со мной, дура, тошнит уже от тебя. Супермен не тратит время впустую. Давай, детка, насаживайся на мой кол, Прямо с налёта, тебе ни к чему ухаживания: Шал*ву видно за 5 километров. Я больше не играю в игры, не придумываю ласковых имён с тех пор, как порвал с этой, Как её? Теперь я другой человек, поцелуй меня в зад и в губы, и вообще, с какой стати Я должен просить? Отсо*и, бери бабки или лучше отхлещи меня по зад**це. Ты не потаску*а? Тогда я отымею тебя. Не хочешь выметаться отсюда? Я прогоню тебя взашей. Что, киска, ошарашена? Ничего, переживёшь. Мне ничего не стоит, чтобы выставить тебя за дверь. Я очень мил? Угостить тебя мороженым? Ты, су*а, если бы ты умерла, я бы не купил тебе новую жизнь. Ты что, метишь мне в жёны? Ты что, Mariah? Чёрта с два! Одно я знаю наверняка: Тёлки уходят, тёлки приходят – В субботу до понедельника, В понедельник – до воскресенья. Может, однажды, я полюблю тебя, Может, однажды, мы будем вместе, А до той поры пусть кто угодно пользуется этой подзаборной шлю*ой.[Припев:] Я не могу стать твоим суперменом, Не могу стать твоим суперменом, Не могу стать твоим суперменом, Не могу стать твоим суперменом, Я не могу стать твоим суперменом, Не могу стать твоим суперменом, Не могу стать твоим суперменом, Твоим суперменом, твоим суперменом…[Eminem:] Не поймите меня превратно: Я обожаю девочек, Это ни для кого не секрет, Все об этом знают, Ведь всем нужен секс, Так что, дорогуша? Речь идёт о том, чтобы я остался твоим приятелем, Мы будем друзьями, Я буду звонить тебе, Я буду преследовать тебя в барах, Но я не знаю, на какой машине буду. [Крик женщины] Посмотрим, захочется ли тебе развлекаться на вечеринках. Ты не хочешь этого? Я тоже, Я не хочу показывать тебе факи, увидев в компании незнакомых парней. Между нами Слишком много гордости. Я не ревнивый, но женщины лгут. Хотя, пожалуй, это делают только шлю*и. Даже трудно представить нас с тобой вместе. Я никогда не любил тебя так, чтобы полностью доверять тебе. Мы просто встретились и я просто тра*ал тебя. Одно я знаю наверняка: Тёлки уходят, тёлки приходят – В субботу до понедельника, В понедельник – до воскресенья. Может, однажды, я полюблю тебя, Может, однажды, мы будем вместе, А до той поры пусть кто угодно пользуется этой подзаборной шлю*ой.[Eminem Dina Rae – Припев: 2 раза] [Eminem:] Я знаю, что ты хочешь меня, детка, Кажется, я тоже хочу тебя…[Dina Rea:] Кажется, я люблю тебя, малыш…[Eminem:] Кажется, я тоже люблю тебя… Я здесь, чтобы спасти тебя, детка… Добро пожаловать в мир Шейди! Я хочу, чтобы мы были вместе, Пусть наша любовь распустится, подобно цветку! Ты знаешь, что хочешь меня, детка, Ты знаешь, что я тоже хочу тебя. Меня называют Суперменом, Я здесь для того, чтобы спасти тебя. Я хочу спасти тебя, девочка, Добро пожаловать в мир Шейди![Dina Rea:] О, малыш, ты сводишь меня с ума![Eminem:] Су*а, меня от тебя тошнит…[Eminem:] Сначала ты говорила:…[Eminem женским голосом:] Я не под кайфом, Я, такая сексапильная, маячу перед тобой дни напролёт. Не понимаю, в чём суть всего этого, Для меня ты тот же старый добрый Маршалл…[Eminem:] Да, детка, поиграй в эту игру…[Eminem женским голосом:] Hailey Jade… обожаю это имя. Классная у тебя татуировка… что она значит? Порву на части – А-а, клёво!..[Eminem:] Для начала, ты не знаешь Маршалла, К тому же, эмоции в сторону, Это – один из пунктов моего арсенала. Я сброшу тебя с этой барной стойки – Вот ещё одна судебная тяжба – Оставлю отпечатки по всему телу, Боже мой, тебя надо насилу оттаскивать от бутылки. Ты желаешь того, что тебе недоступно, Детка, это очень плохо! Не дотрагивайся до того, что для тебя запретно, А то окажешься с руками, связанными за спиной. Я запихну тебе Тампакс, обсыпанный кокаином, и отшлёпаю до потери сознания. Детка, ты упустила свой шанс, Я не хочу рушить твои планы, Но одно я знаю наверняка: Тёлки уходят, тёлки приходят – В субботу до понедельника, В понедельник – до воскресенья. Может, однажды, я полюблю тебя, Может, однажды, мы будем вместе, А до той поры пусть кто угодно пользуется этой подзаборной шлю*ой.[Eminem Dina Rae – Припев: 2 раза] [Eminem:] Я знаю, что ты хочешь меня, детка, Кажется, я тоже хочу тебя…[Dina Rea:] Кажется, я люблю тебя, малыш…[Eminem:] Кажется, я тоже люблю тебя… Я здесь, чтобы спасти тебя, детка… Добро пожаловать в мир Шейди! Я хочу, чтобы мы были вместе, Пусть наша любовь распустится, подобно цветку! Ты знаешь, что хочешь меня, детка, Ты знаешь, что я тоже хочу тебя. Меня называют Суперменом, Я здесь для того, чтобы спасти тебя. Я хочу спасти тебя, девочка, Добро пожаловать в мир Шейди![Dina Rea:] О, малыш, ты сводишь меня с ума![Eminem:] Су*а, меня от тебя тошнит…[Припев: 2 раза, а в промежутке между – поёт Dina Rae]",

You can\u0027t put a \"\u0026\" right after you ended the sentence with the exclamation mark 3. You shouldn\u0027t write \"damn\" with an upper case, it\u0027s not the first word in the sentence, the \"\u0026\" is. 4. And you forgot the period at the end 5.

I love how he\u0027s a 100% honest and how he spilled his heart out writing this song. It\u0027s really inspiring. Eminem inspired almost every kid from my generation to get off their asses and do something. He inspired me to get up and chase my dream which is rap. I\u0027m an 20 year old rapper and I think you\u0027d enjoy the music on my channel. My most honest song is called “Suicide Note\", I spilled my heart out writing and recording it. Check it out if you get the chance to, I promise you won\u0027t be disappointed! P.s..There\u0027s no need to hate because I\u0027m advertising, I\u0027m just chasing my dream!",

Belive in what you want but dont Expect me to Change my mind Thats only fair. In my opinion religions are there to give people the feeling to belong to something but what i also see is that Religion like Staates and Companys and so on actually separates them as soon as they think. \"This is the best everybody else is wrong and what they say is irrelevant\". I mean why Not share knowledge instead of fighting for the \"truth\". Because Thats what holds everything back. Id like to ask you a question: what Do you think is the Source of an individual?
