  "Im Jewish, I used to be agnostic and wanted to find out the truth and found Christianity and was a Eastern Orthodox Christian but then I met my husband who Jewish and certified rabbi and he showed me the truth, he did not convert me nor pressured me to. All we did was study the Torah and he taught me the language of the Torah and we fell in love with one another with the Torah being our first interaction. I did not fall for him then converted. We were already getting married when I was still in the Christian faith. He showed me. So it’s okay to be the faith of your partner but DO NOT convert for him or her if you in your heart do not see it. Because I love my husband and his two daughters who I token on as my own princess but I definitely would still remain Jewish following the Torah if we were to ever divorce or widowed. ❤",

  "\"مِنَ النُورِ إلى ضَلَماتِ الْضَلَماتْ\". يَا حَسْرَةً عَلَى الْعِبَادِ ۚ مَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا كَانُوا بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ (30) قوله تعالى : يا حسرة على العباد ما يأتيهم من رسول إلا كانوا به يستهزئون قوله تعالى : ياحسرة على العباد منصوب ; لأنه نداء نكرة ، ولا يجوز فيه غير النصب عند البصريين . وفي حرف أبي \" يا حسرة العباد \" على الإضافة . وحقيقة الحسرة في اللغة أن يلحق الإنسان من الندم ما يصير به حسيرا . وزعم الفراء أن الاختيار النصب ، وأنه لو رفعت النكرة الموصولة بالصلة كان صوابا . واستشهد بأشياء ، منها : أنه سمع من العرب : يا مهتم بأمرنا لا تهتم . وأنشد : يا دار غيرها البلى تغييرا قال النحاس : وفي هذا إبطال باب النداء أو أكثره ; لأنه يرفع النكرة المحضة ، ويرفع ما هو بمنزلة المضاف في طوله ، ويحذف التنوين متوسطا ، ويرفع ما هو في المعنى مفعول بغير علة أوجبت ذلك . فأما ما حكاه عن العرب فلا يشبه ما أجازه ; لأن تقدير ( يا مهتم بأمرنا لا تهتم ) على التقديم والتأخير ، والمعنى : يا أيها المهتم لا تهتم بأمرنا . وتقدير البيت : يا أيتها الدار ، ثم حول المخاطبة ، أي : يا هؤلاء غير هذه الدار البلى ، كما قال الله - جل وعز - : حتى إذا كنتم في الفلك وجرين بهم . ف \" حسرة \" منصوب على النداء ، كما تقول : يا رجلا أقبل . ومعنى النداء : هذا موضع حضور الحسرة . الطبري : المعنى : يا حسرة من العباد على أنفسهم ، وتندما وتلهفا في استهزائهم برسل الله عليهم السلام . ابن عباس : \" يا حسرة على العباد \" أي : يا ويلا على العباد . وعنه أيضا : حل هؤلاء محل من يتحسر عليهم . وروى الربيع عن أنس عن أبي العالية أن العباد هاهنا الرسل ، وذلك أن الكفار لما رأوا العذاب قالوا : يا حسرة على العباد ، فتحسروا على قتلهم ، وترك الإيمان بهم ، فتمنوا الإيمان حين لم ينفعهم الإيمان ، وقاله مجاهد . وقال الضحاك : إنها حسرة الملائكة على الكفار حين كذبوا الرسل . وقيل : \" يا حسرة على العباد \" من قول الرجل الذي جاء من أقصى المدينة يسعى ، لما وثب القوم لقتله . وقيل : إن الرسل الثلاثة هم الذين قالوا لما قتل القوم ذلك الرجل الذي جاء من أقصى المدينة يسعى ، وحل بالقوم العذاب : يا حسرة على هؤلاء ، كأنهم تمنوا أن يكونوا قد آمنوا . وقيل : هذا من قول القوم ، قالوا لما قتلوا الرجل وفارقتهم الرسل ، أو قتلوا الرجل مع الرسل الثلاثة ، على اختلاف الروايات : يا حسرة على هؤلاء الرسل ، وعلى هذا الرجل ، ليتنا آمنا بهم في الوقت الذي ينفع الإيمان . وتم الكلام على هذا ، ثم ابتدأ فقال : ما يأتيهم من رسول . وقرأ ابن هرمز ومسلم بن جندب وعكرمة : \" يا حسره على العباد \" بسكون الهاء للحرص على البيان وتقرير المعنى في النفس ، إذ كان موضع وعظ وتنبيه ، والعرب تفعل ذلك في مثله ، وإن لم يكن موضعا للوقف . ومن ذلك ما روي عن النبي - صلى الله عليه وسلم - أنه كان يقطع قراءته حرفا حرفا ; حرصا على البيان والإفهام . ويجوز أن يكون \" على العباد \" متعلقا بالحسرة ، ويجوز أن يكون متعلقا بمحذوف لا بالحسرة ، فكأنه قدر الوقف على الحسرة فأسكن الهاء ، ثم قال : \" على العباد \" أي : أتحسر على العباد . وعن ابن عباس والضحاك وغيرهما : ( يا حسرة العباد ) مضاف بحذف \" على \" . وهو خلاف المصحف . وجاز أن يكون من باب الإضافة إلى الفاعل ، فيكون العباد فاعلين ، كأنهم إذا شاهدوا العذاب تحسروا ، فهو كقولك : يا قيام زيد . ويجوز أن تكون من باب الإضافة إلى المفعول ، فيكون العباد مفعولين ، فكأن العباد يتحسر عليهم من يشفق لهم . وقراءة من قرأ : \" يا حسرة على العباد \" مقوية لهذا المعنى .",
