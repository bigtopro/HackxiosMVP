The music video theme compresses all the essences of my emotional experiences that I have felt during the whole trip. When I first got off the plane from Narita Tokyo Airport and waited in line for my passport check in, old seniors greeted and helped me to get my passport ready.  During the whole trip, I have been to Mt. Fuji , Meiji Shrine, Hirajuku streets and many others. All those places were worthy to visit and nice but I couldn’t get rid of feeling that the places seem to be a bit old and rusty, dull. After watching the music video, I thought to myself that Japan is a beautiful country , in reality the nation itself is an aged nation going through the transitional time where the nation is moving away from its past golden age.",

  "Youngblood: The RPG A Neon-Punk Action RPG About Love, Obsession, and the Struggle for Freedom Setting: A futuristic, neon-lit metropolis known as Vera City, where love isn’t just an emotion—it’s a power source. The city is ruled by The Affinity Council, an elite group that controls people\u0027s relationships through a system called the Emotional Grid. The Grid assigns partners based on compatibility, ensuring \"stability\" but stripping people of real choice. Love and heartbreak generate energy that fuels the city’s power supply, and those who try to break the system are labeled Youngbloods—rogue lovers who fight for free will. Story: You play as Kade, a former Grid enforcer who fell in love with Nova, a rebellious Youngblood. When Nova is taken by the Council for \"Reconditioning\"—a process that erases feelings of love—you must embark on a dangerous journey to rescue her. Along the way, you’ll uncover the truth about the Emotional Grid, the secret experiments behind it, and the cost of true love. But there’s a twist—Nova’s memories of you are fading, and if you don’t reach her in time, she may become your enemy. Gameplay Features: • Love as a Power System – Your relationships fuel your abilities. Passion, heartbreak, and devotion influence your stats and skills. • Choice-Driven Narrative – Your decisions affect Nova’s memories and the fate of Vera City. Will you fight for love or let go? • Rhythm-Based Combat – Battles sync with the pulse of the city, requiring precise timing and emotional charge to land devastating combos. • Faction System – Join the Youngblood Rebellion or infiltrate the Affinity Council. Each path changes your story. • Emotional Alchemy – Mix emotions like Desire, Regret, Hope, and Fury to create new abilities and unlock hidden paths. Final Choice: As Nova teeters between remembering and forgetting, the climax forces you to decide: • Break the Grid, free love, but risk losing her forever. • Rebuild the system with her by your side, at the cost of the revolution. • Walk away, letting go of your love and embracing the unknown.",

  "Bait 1: Remember the words you told me » Ingat kata-kata yang kau ucapkan Love me till the day I die » Cintai aku sampai aku mati Surrender my everything » Aku menyerahkan segalanya cause you made me believe you’re mine » Karena kau membuatku percaya kau adalah milikku Yeah you used to call me baby » Dulu kau memanggilku ‘sayang’ now you calling me by name » Sekarang kau memanggilku dengan nama Takes one to know one, yeah » Hanya seseorang sepertimu yang bisa memahamiku you beat me at my own damn game » kau mengalahkanku dalam permainanku sendiri » Bait pertama menggambarkan perubahan dalam hubungan yang awalnya penuh cinta, tetapi kini mulai berjarak. Penyanyi merasa dikhianati karena pasangannya yang dulu penuh kasih kini bersikap dingin dan menjauh. Pre-Reff: You push and you push and I’m pulling away » Kau terus mendorong, dan aku semakin menjauh Pulling away from you » Menjauh darimu I give and I give and I give and you take » Aku memberi dan terus memberi, sementara kau hanya mengambil Give and you take » Memberi dan mengambil » Pre-reff menunjukkan ketidakseimbangan dalam hubungan, di mana sang penyanyi merasa selalu memberi tanpa mendapatkan balasan yang setimpal. Ada perasaan lelah karena terus berusaha sementara pasangannya tampaknya hanya menerima tanpa usaha. Reff: Young blood » Anak muda say you want me, say you want me out of your life » kau bilang kau menginginkanku keluar dari hidupmu And I’m just a dead man walking tonight » Dan aku hanya seperti mayat hidup malam ini But you need it, yeah you need it all of the time » Tapi kau membutuhkannya, ya, kau selalu membutuhkannya Ohh Ohh » Vokalisasi Young blood » Anak muda say you want me, say you want me back in your life » kau bilang kau menginginkanku kembali dalam hidupmu So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight » Jadi aku hanya seperti mayat yang merangkak malam ini Cause I need it, yeah I need it all of the time » Karena aku membutuhkannya, ya, aku selalu membutuhkannya Ohh Ohh » Vokalisasi » Reff menunjukkan konflik emosional dalam hubungan mereka. Pasangannya terus berubah pikiran, terkadang ingin pergi, tetapi di saat lain ingin kembali. Penyanyi merasa terjebak, seperti mayat hidup yang terus berusaha tetapi tidak pernah benar-benar hidup dalam hubungan ini. Bait 2: Lately our conversations » Akhir-akhir ini percakapan kita end like it’s our last goodbye » berakhir seperti perpisahan terakhir Yeah, one of us gets too drunk » Ya, salah satu dari kita terlalu mabuk and calls about a hundred times » dan menelepon ratusan kali So who you been calling baby » Jadi, siapa yang kau panggil ‘sayang’? nobody could take my place » Tak ada yang bisa menggantikanku When you’re looking at those strangers » Saat kau melihat orang asing itu hope to God you see my face » aku berharap kau melihat wajahku » Bait kedua menggambarkan dinamika yang beracun dalam hubungan ini. Ada siklus pertengkaran, mabuk, dan telepon berulang kali yang mencerminkan ketergantungan emosional. Meskipun pasangan sang penyanyi tampaknya ingin move on, penyanyi tetap berharap ia masih diingat. Reff: Young blood » Anak muda say you want me, say you want me out of your life » kau bilang kau menginginkanku keluar dari hidupmu And I’m just a dead man walking tonight » Dan aku hanya seperti mayat hidup malam ini But you need it, yeah you need it all of the time » Tapi kau membutuhkannya, ya, kau selalu membutuhkannya Ohh Ohh » Vokalisasi Young blood » Anak muda say you want me, say you want me back in your life » kau bilang kau menginginkanku kembali dalam hidupmu So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight » Jadi aku hanya seperti mayat yang merangkak malam ini Cause I need it, yeah I need it all of the time » Karena aku membutuhkannya, ya, aku selalu membutuhkannya Ohh Ohh » Vokalisasi » Reff ini kembali memperkuat perasaan terjebak dalam hubungan yang penuh tarik-ulur. Mereka saling membutuhkan, tetapi juga menyakiti satu sama lain. Bridge: You push and you push and I’m pulling away » Kau terus mendorong, dan aku semakin menjauh Pulling away from you » Menjauh darimu I give and I give and I give and you take » Aku memberi dan terus memberi, sementara kau hanya mengambil Give and you take » Memberi dan mengambil You’re running around and I’m running away » Kau terus berlari ke sana kemari, dan aku hanya berusaha pergi Running away from you mmm, from you » Berusaha pergi darimu mmm, pergi darimu » Bridge ini semakin menekankan dinamika hubungan yang tidak sehat. Sang penyanyi merasa selalu dikejar saat mencoba menjauh, sementara pasangannya terus mencari perhatian tanpa benar-benar ingin berkomitmen. Reff: Young blood » Anak muda say you want me, say you want me out of your life » kau bilang kau menginginkanku keluar dari hidupmu And I’m just a dead man walking tonight » Dan aku hanya seperti mayat hidup malam ini But you need it, yeah you need it all of the time » Tapi kau membutuhkannya, ya, kau selalu membutuhkannya Ohh Ohh » Vokalisasi Young blood » Anak muda say you want me, say you want me back in your life » kau bilang kau menginginkanku kembali dalam hidupmu So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight » Jadi aku hanya seperti mayat yang merangkak malam ini Cause I need it, yeah I need it all of the time » Karena aku membutuhkannya, ya, aku selalu membutuhkannya Ohh Ohh » Vokalisasi » Reff ini kembali memperkuat perasaan terjebak dalam hubungan yang penuh tarik-ulur. Mereka saling membutuhkan, tetapi juga menyakiti satu sama lain. Outro: You push and you push and I’m pulling away » Kau terus mendorong, dan aku semakin menjauh Pulling away from you » Menjauh darimu I give and I give and I give and you take » Aku memberi dan terus memberi, sementara kau hanya mengambil Give and you take » Memberi dan mengambil Young blood » Anak muda say you want me, say you want me out of your life » kau bilang kau menginginkanku keluar dari hidupmu And I’m just a dead man walking tonight » Dan aku hanya seperti mayat hidup malam ini » Outro mengulang konflik utama dalam lagu: hubungan yang penuh tarik-ulur, ketidakpastian, dan siklus toksik yang terus berulang.

  "This reminds me, that my Grandfather, who was my Grandmother\u0027s third husband (Gary Ulrich) had been a \u0027Hells Angel\u0027 member in the 1960s. He told me what the initiation evolved, and how he was \u0027Jumped in\u0027, much of what was involved, was gross.  Then, I found out that he had also been, a member of the Roller Derby  in the 50s and 60s.  His position was as a \u0027Jammer\u0027 who was an \u0027Enforcer\u0027 who would provoke the other team to fight. Grandma and he divorced in the mid 1970s. I did see Gary  in the early 1980s, when our Aunty Cille died, and I couldn\u0027t believe what I saw; it was Gary, but now he was working as a Private Investigator.  He was dressed in an all white three piece suit. He was driving Grandma\u0027s 1959 Cadillac convertible, it was \u0027Triple white\u0027, and showed me the two pearl handled 45s he wore, concealed under his blazer in crossed shoulder holsters. He had the same haircut he always had; his natural hair color was white, it was naturally peroxide blonde. And it was styled in the \u0027Jellyroll DA\u0027 swept back on the sides, and curly on top. He used Pomade; alot of it. When I saw him, he went to great lengths to give me his business card, and show me his guns. He looked like a man, out of his time, trying to hold on to his \u0027High Times\u0027 of the past. I wish I had a camera, to record the spectacle. He also had a white mustache, that extended, down on the sides of his mouth. His cheeks were concave, he had always been, a thin, angry man. But fun to be with, because, you always felt like, you were, getting away with something, some kind of illegal activity.  What a guy!  I never knew, how he may have died, but I bet it was in a shootout or something terrible. I\u0027d pour a beer out over your grave, if I knew where it was. ❤",

For me it was a music video where the world looked like a war or something happened and there were these people who looked just so lost and the government arrived to evacuate them and one kid and the mom ended up separated and that’s all I can remember. I’m sure the music was in the genre of one republic but I can’t make the connection to what song it was",
  "Can you remember a little bit of the chorus? was it from a different genre than pop?",

Also holy shit did they just die at the end?! Wtf? I swear that reminds me of something, but I\u0027m not sure what. I feel like there was some book or movie with a similar plot, people committing suicide when they got too old or something \u0027cause they\u0027d rather die young (or at least not die of old age).

Perhaps both things are true but it\u0027s more about their time together than their ending for beginnings. Nothing is certain but you are always yourself. Layering that with the delinquent lifestyle something that compares itself to samurai and their philosophy around cherry blossoms living short but beautiful lives, the tumultuous nature of these lives and yet making it to old age. The song captures a moment, a feeling of their youth, and that\u0027s what they\u0027re doing now. Capturing one moment, maybe their last. I agree that the glitching could be a metaphor for the way memories are imperfect or fading. Or maybe it\u0027s the matrix and this is how they restart their code.

  "​@@metaldad2112 Don\u0027t worry, no offense. Most of the time boybands are formed by someone who is not part of the group (maybe a management company or a tv show), they are also a singing group, they dedicate themselves exclusively to singing although some of them also perform choreographed dances for their shows. Is it possible for a boyband to evolve into a band? Yes, a clear example is the legendary the beatles. But the truth is that as you will see 5sos does not admit any of these characteristics, they are a band since they play musical instruments and they all sing very well (seriously they are amazing singers), but Luke Hemmings is the main vocalist, they created the band themselves when they were in school and started playing in pubs or bars, they attracted the attention of a record label and released some eps, then they opened for hot chelle rae and one direction, then they released their debut album and after 3 more albums and an album on the way, the story goes on. They write their own lyrics and well personally, sometimes I love the live versions of their songs more than the studio versions, listening to their live album meet you there tour live you can see what great musicians they are. Conclusion: 5sos is a band and not a boyband.",

And they are reliving their memories from when they were younger before leaving this Earth? Like, there were only like 24 hours before they died and they knew that. So they started reminiscing about their past, how they met and all the stuff they went through. And in the end of their journey down the memory lane, they sat together holding hands, just like how they were in the ‘real world’ in that hospital place. Then, the watch stops. They die peacefully together. Also, to me, it felt like 20th century Japan was their version of destination after death. The end of the road was a place where they felt the most happiness and peace. Together. Anyway! I am rambling. It’s like 3 in the moring, sleep deprived and this was such an emotional video that reminded me of my maternal grandparents. They were the cutest, most wholesome couple ever. Great, now I am crying.",

An example would be if instead of the swastika, nazi Germany used a cross. All Catholics and Christians and believers of Jesus Christ would not let that taint the original meaning and symbolism of the cross. Buddhism just isn\u0027t popular in the west.",

Then they took a drug to kill themselves. And then when they were holding hands you can see those star tattoos, that means they already did it in the past. Ok so there\u0027s a saying that before you die you can see the most beautiful moments of your lives. Their young lives were their best time so before dieing they were have flashbacks of their best moments. And when they \"died\" we all thought they were dieing at the end actually in the past they fell asleep and as in the present they were dieing the whole time and they were just remembering it.

  "I\u0027m really confused on how this video made me cry so fucking hard... I am lucky, I marry the love of my life and after years married we have our first daugther, we were really poor, but eventually throw hard work I started ascending on my job and now we are really in a better situation (money). We used to be as close as the vid shows the couple were but... now... I\u0027ve lost everything, am worried about some suicidal thoughts (that are just that, I\u0027m not gonna stop living, cause that would take for me the small momments where I can see my wife\u0027s and daugther\u0027s laugh) cause I\u0027m loosing all my motivations to keep working or so ever... Lately I feel lonely, sad... forgotten... I work really hard lately and my wife is just to busy taking care of our daugther, so I can\u0027t really complain about her not giving me enough time.. we just don\u0027t have it anymore, we used to stay till late night cause that way we could share more hours, now we are really tired to even trying to stay up late... so we don\u0027t have time alone together, we just play with our daughter (wich I love, couldn\u0027t ask for some better gift that arriving home after 16 hours of work to be able to play about 45 minutes before my wife and daughter go to bed), my wife is so tired that she doesn\u0027t have the time or energy to help me with somethings of the house and that is okay... but lately I don\u0027t have time to lunch at work and most of times am arriving so tired that I just go to bed with my girls cause I just can\u0027t find any incentive to cook or eat anymore. My work is consuming me... I don\u0027t have time to give my wife all the attention I wanna give her, basically I can share with my wife 1 hour or 1.5 hours a day... and I was so used to really be with her every second... that makes me feel so lonely, I miss her so much through my day and can\u0027t do anything cause she seems distant for a couple of months now, and no matter what I try she says is everything good, and that doesn\u0027t matter cause she knows I\u0027m tired, but things doesn\u0027t seem to be okay... by any means... so basically I\u0027m having this stupid thoughts... I can\u0027t be happy anymore this life makes no sense for me... what I love the most is to share with my family be with them, and it seems that in order to give them a better life I have to constantly see them less... and it breaks my heart what is the point on giving my wife and daugther a better life if it\u0027s gonna break our family... and in the other hand what if I leave all behind and start over poor as always... we might be happier, and closer... but we wuold once again be counting cents to make a day... I\u0027m so lost... idk what to do... have nobody else to talk about this... so when I saw this video... this video... this fucking video... youngblood... all those memories are keeping what\u0027s left of my inner fire alive, but now I look at my life and I fucking want those times back I wanna have my girl with me all day, I wanna enjoy my baby as much as she does, I wanna make them laugh I want my wife to fall in love with me again like she used to do with the small things that I made for her, I wanna have time to sing to her, write her letters again and got dammit I wanna do the same things again share the same hobbies, and do everything together again. Fran, Sophie: If some day, years ahead from now I show you girls this, please know that both of you are my life, and even tho I feel sad and lost right now, I will do everything EVERYTHING to be back in game again, to be relaxed, happy, alive. I will get back our momments babe and I will fucking find the way to have what this video shows.... they kept their young memories alive, and they shared and enjoyed 60 years together, and STILL the look of love and gratitude in the eyes of the couple is the same look I wish for us in 40 years. I love you. And last this is just for you Sophie, sometimes men and woman have to take paths that are not the best, and some other times, we lie to ourselfs because society says \"is the best way\", I\u0027m no longer sure if that is the way... A better house, the posibility of a better school or college... that is not life... BUT HELPS take your studies seriously sunshine, you will have only one duty till your 18. BUT THAT IS ONLY WHEN YOU ARE A KID, baby... life is to be happy and to do what we love, no matter how good the people says it is gonna be for you and your loved ones DON\u0027T LISTEN PLEASE DON\u0027T, baby one does SO MUCH MORE GOOD to the people around you when they see you whole and joyful, do what you love, don\u0027t be like me don\u0027t make the same mistakes, because sometimes when you take a desition, sometimes it implicates that you have to stick to that desition for a couple of years, and I\u0027m telling you is not even close to worth. Right now I barely have time to share with you, I\u0027m doing this for \"your own good\" but I\u0027m sure your mom would be alot happier, if I would have more time to stay around, and also you will sunshine, so remember this baby, both me and you mom love you and we will break our backs and chew every sorrow or bad situations so you DON\u0027T have to, please take your time, make mistakes, live the life you want, and if by any means you get \"delayed\" on your life, believe me is not wasted because if you \"lose\" a couple of years doing the things you love, It will never be a waste, will be an investment, so please baby no matter how much people laugh about your dreams just keep going even if we tell you not to, just keep on going, we might not understand at first, but remember this Sophie, your mom loves you so much she would NEVER be other than proud of you with any desition you take, and me... well you will discover some very basic concept of ur pa, I\u0027m a simple man, I can\u0027t ask for anything else than see you both smile, so if some day I get a bit mad because I\u0027m square, please just give me a hug and smile at me like you always do, that will change my mood, but will not change the fact that even if you make a mistake I will be proudly stand by your side, I would never wish you to fall, but if you do, we will always get your back. Love you both, on the only year I\u0027ve been sad since I married the most beautiful woman in the world. DM 2021.",
