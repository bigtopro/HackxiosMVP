  "WOW! You made it to CEO Land impressive.  The only problem is there are no good CEO literally in the Entire Earth that I am aware of because they all are overcharging for their services.  See, historically there was this one big wig who name I unfortunately forgot but intended to remember who proposed setting reasonable limits on this.  Then I suppose others rebelled and wanted to make their salary a tab bit more or astronomically more than the first reasonable limit setter.  Probably because man sometimes has a strong tendency not to be like told what to do.  Wrinkle in Time.  I suppose his logical argument lacked the emotion necessary to get the understanding through back then.  So I stand in his stead reminding you again.  Further, and these wicked ones are those that will callously and through thievery means take advantage of their geniuses the true needed masters and then dump them out of the ride when it draws to a conclusion taking all the spoils for themselves.",

  "Everyone in Inkopolis knows Maiku\u0027s story by heart. A story of too-large hope and a LOT of luck.  When he rode into Inkopolis by taxi since his mother was drunk (again), he had a smile. Finally a chance to show himself. To show how good of a singer he\u0027s been recently...and maybe to get some pocket change. He never smiled until that very day. One day, he found a man named Idunno. His hair was different than all the other Inklings...More pretty, somehow. He became good friends in a second with him, telling him his plan and always being told how insane of an idea it is. Even another inkling who came up, Clip, became friends with him. Unlike Idunno, Clip liked his insane ideas and always told him to keep on. So, he did. After another day of singing in Inkopolis Square with a boombox and gathering crowds larger than the Sermon on the Mount, he recognized two infamous inklings. Pearl and Marina. the Off the Hook band, and idols in Inkopolis. Marina seemed to stare a lot while Pearl hated seeing someone good at singing. They stayed their distance until.. A day after singing for pocket change, Marina came up to him with an offer. If he could win in a 1v2 Turf War against her and Pearl, she\u0027d let him join their band. For reference, Maiku only played turf war with Idunno. Idunno was an excellent fighter and Maiku was an excellent turfer. When he heard this he immediately accepted. It was a shot, right? Like that one song he always sang.  *If you had, one shot, one opportunity to have everything you\u0027ve ever wished for, would you take it? or let it slip away?* He was told off by Idunno that he could never win it, but he kept practicing no matter what. Idunno stopped telling him off eventually, and helped him practice. For a long while they practiced until they were machines at Turf War..and able to win at any cost. After the match, he won by pure hope. And finallly got to play in a concert on the big stage, with Off the Hook...And learned to play the guitar. Now Maiku is Off the Hook\u0027s lead guitarist, and smiles every day.  Subscribe to my channel and in a few years, you\u0027ll get notifications for tons of animated stories of my characters, done using MOCAP suits and custom models.

  "Dear Brendon, first of all thank you for being a huge part of my life. Panic! songs has played a significant part of my self-development growing up. Although, I hate seeing how it all end up like this, horribly. Should\u0027ve done this 3 albums ago. It\u0027s so sad to see the very last breath of my favorite childhood band was ending on a bad terms. How did everything go wrong? I wanna admit that time and time, you did make me mad for a bit for what have you done to this beloved band. What made everyone never wanna stay in the first place. I actually disaknowledge the last two Panic! albums. They are that bad. Whatever, it didn\u0027t even matter in the end. Lastly, I know this comment wouldn\u0027t even see a light of day let alone reach you and Im just a nobody to you but for God sake Brendon, control that ego. We\u0027re all a big man of ourselves I get it. Anyway, good luck with your future, good luck being a dad, you actually earned this. Constant touring since 2005 is crazy man. And finally. Congrats, Sarah. Now I\u0027ll go on with my life like a normal person because I havent listen to panic for a loong time anyway. Actually this disbandment didnt even matter as Panic! At the Disco has already died to me back in 2015. Goodbye. Fucker.",

It was a good vibe. Everytime I would go on a drive with her, I would ask her if we could go to Five Below to get Slime Lickers, since it was the trend then and everyone was making DIY ones and trying them on social media (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube etc.) and everyone was saying they were at Five Below so sometimes me and my aunt would go there to not only get Slime Lickers, but probably other cutesy nice decorative items or accessories. And when we would drive there, sometimes she would play this song or it would come on and overall not just the memory of driving to Five Below to get Slime Lickers with my aunt, but overall no matter when I listen to it or where I listen to it, it gives you good vibes. It\u0027s got that melody, that  tune, the beat the happiness. This song was very popular too! I also liked thinking about it or hearing it in the mall, too! It was fun just going to Hot Topic and shopping and you hear this song come on at the mall. This song literally is telling you you\u0027ll have a good day. It\u0027s nice listening to it especially in the summer. I love this song Panic! At The Disco. Thank you.",

  "Pink Floyd - High Hopes Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young In a world of magnets and miracles Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary The ringing of the division bell had begun Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway Do they still meet there by the Cut There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps Running before times took our dreams away Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground To a life consumed by slow decay The grass was greener The light was brighter When friends surrounded The nights of wonder Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again Dragged by the force of some inner tide At a higher altitude with flag unfurled We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world Encumbered forever by desire and ambition There\u0027s a hunger still unsatisfied Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon Though down this road we\u0027ve been so many times The grass was greener The light was brighter The taste was sweeter The nights of wonder With friends surrounded The dawn mist glowing The water flowing The endless river Forever and ever",
