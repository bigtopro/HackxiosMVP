  "Yeah, It\u0027s been a ride... I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one Now some of you might still be in that place If you\u0027re trying to get out, just follow me I\u0027ll get you there You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay \u0027em But you won\u0027t take this thing out these words before I say \u0027em Cause ain\u0027t no way I\u0027m let you stop me from causing mayhem When I say \u0027em or do something I do it, I don\u0027t give a damn What you think, I\u0027m doing this for me, so fuck the world Feed it beans, it\u0027s gassed up, if a thing\u0027s stopping me I\u0027mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly And all those who look down on me I\u0027m tearing down your balcony No if ands or buts don\u0027t try to ask him why or how can he From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he\u0027s still shit\u0027n Whether he\u0027s on salary, paid hourly Until he bows out or he shit\u0027s his bowels out of him Whichever comes first, for better or worse He\u0027s married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas His gift is a curse, forget the earth he\u0027s got the urge To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe I\u0027m not afraid to take a stand Everybody come take my hand We\u0027ll walk this road together, through the storm Whatever weather, cold or warm Just let you know that, you\u0027re not alone Holla if you feel that you\u0027ve been down the same road Ok quit playin\u0027 with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap I shouldn\u0027t have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it\u0027s a rap You said you was king, you lied through your teeth For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you\u0027re getting capped And to the fans, I\u0027ll never let you down again, I\u0027m back I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact Let\u0027s be honest, that last Relapse CD was \"ehhhh\" Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground Relax, I ain\u0027t going back to that now All I\u0027m tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW Cause I ain\u0027t playin\u0027 around There\u0027s a game called circle and I don\u0027t know how I\u0027m way too up to back down But I think I\u0027m still tryna figure this crap out Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn\u0027t This fucking black cloud still follow\u0027s me around But it\u0027s time to exorcise these demons These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now! I\u0027m not afraid to take a stand Everybody come take my hand We\u0027ll walk this road together, through the storm Whatever weather, cold or warm Just let you know that, you\u0027re not alone Holla if you feel that you\u0027ve been down the same road And I just can\u0027t keep living this way So starting today, I\u0027m breaking out of this cage I\u0027m standing up, Imma face my demons I\u0027m manning up, Imma hold my ground I\u0027ve had enough, now I\u0027m so fed up Time to put my life back together right now It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through And don\u0027t even realise what you did, believe me you I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise To focus only on handling my responsibility\u0027s as a father So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it You couldn\u0027t lift a single shingle on it Cause the way I feel, I\u0027m strong enough to go to the club Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up Cause I\u0027m raising the bar, I shoot for the moon But I\u0027m too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazed and I\u0027m not afraid to take a stand Everybody come take my hand We\u0027ll walk this road together, through the storm Whatever weather, cold or warm Just let you know that, you\u0027re not alone Holla if you feel that you\u0027ve been down the same road",
