  "This world can\u0027t hurt you Cuts you deep and leaves a scar Things fall apart, nothing breaks like a heart This song is for all my friends in Ukraine I heard you on the phone last night We live and die by pretty lies, you know it We both know it This silver bullet cigarettes This burning house, there\u0027s nothing left And it\u0027s smoking, we both know it We got all night to fall in love Just like that we\u0027d fall apart We\u0027re broken, we\u0027re broken Ooh, and nothing, nothing, nothing gon\u0027 save us now There\u0027s broken silence By thunder crashing in the dark (crash in the dark) This broken record Spin endless circles in the bar (spin \u0027round in the bar) This world can\u0027t hurt you It cuts you deep and leaves a scar Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart Nothing breaks like a heart We\u0027ll leave each other cold as ice and high and dry The desert wind is blowing You tryin\u0027 to get me wet? (Is blowing) Remember what you said to me Drunk in love in Tennessee I hold it, we both know it Ooh, and nothing, nothing, nothing gon\u0027 save us now Ooh, yeah, nothing, nothing, nothing gon\u0027 save us now There\u0027s broken silence By thunder crashing in the dark (crash in the dark) This broken record Spin endless circles in the bar (spin \u0027round in the bar) This world can\u0027t hurt you It cuts you deep and leaves a scar Things fall a apart, but nothing breaks like a heart Nothing breaks like a heart Nothing breaks like a heart Nothing breaks like a heart Ooh, yeah, nothing, nothing, nothing gon\u0027 save us now Ooh, yeah, nothing, nothing, nothing gon\u0027 save us now There\u0027s broken silence By thunder crashing in the dark (crash in the dark) This broken record Spin endless circles in the bar (spin \u0027round in the bar) This world can\u0027t hurt you It cuts you deep and leaves a scar Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart Nothing breaks like a heart Nothing breaks like a heart Nothing breaks like a heart",

  "Jantje, ein einzigartiger, unvergesslicher, netter, interessanter, Humorvoller und schöner Mensch, welches auch dieses Lied mag. Ein Mensch an den man immer denken muss, ein Mensch welchen es nur einmal gibt, ein Mensch der einen schönen Charakter hat, ein Mensch der er selber ist und sich nicht verstellt, ein Mensch der es verdient hat komplimente zu erhalten, ein Mensch welcher immer in Erinnerungen bleibt. Ein Mensch mit einem schönen Namen, ein Mensch mit einem einzigartigen auftreten, ein Mensch der einfach toll ist. Ein Mensch den man mehr kennenlernen will, Ein Mensch wo Wörter nicht ausreichen, um diese Person zu beschreiben.",
