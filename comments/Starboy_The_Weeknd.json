  "Just as the beauty of a crafted work clearly indicates the beauty of its craft; and the beauty of crafting indicates the beauty of the title of mastery derived from that art; and the beauty of the title of artistry in the master of a workman indicates the beauty of the attribute of that artist pertaining to that art; and the beauty of his attribute indicates the beauty of his talent and aptitude; and the beauty of his talent indicates the beauty of his spirit, essence, and reality; so too does the beauty and beauty in all the beautiful creatures of this universe, from beginning to end, and in all beautifully made works, bear definitive witness to the beauty and beauty of the actions of the All-Glorious Artist.  And the beauty and beauty of His actions undoubtedly point to the beauty and beauty of the titles, that is, the names, that bear witness to those actions. And the beauty and beauty of the names definitively testify to the beauty and beauty of the sacred attributes, which are the source of the names. And the beauty and beauty of the attributes definitively testify to the beauty and beauty of the essential attributes, which are the source of the attributes.  And the beauty and beauty of the essence of His essence, which is active, identified, and manifest, bears witness with undeniable certainty to the beauty and beauty of His essence, the sacred perfection of His essence, and the sacred beauty of His reality. That is to say, the All-Glorious Maker possesses such boundless beauty and beauty, befitting His sacred essence, that a single shadow of it beautifies all beings from beginning to end. And He possesses such pure and sacred beauty that a single manifestation of it has freely adorned the universe. And He has adorned and illuminated all spheres of existence with flashes of beauty and beauty.  Yes, just as a work cannot be without an act, so too can an act not be without an agent. And just as it is impossible for names to be without names, it is impossible for attributes to be without attributes. Since the existence of an art or a work clearly indicates the act of the one who performs that work, the existence of that act also indicates the existence of its agent, its title, and the attribute and name that constitute the work.  Of course, the perfection and beauty of a work also point, with certitude and obvious certainty, to the perfection and beauty of the act itself, which in turn points to the beauty of the name appropriate to it, which in turn points to the beauty worthy of the attribute, which in turn points to the beauty of the ability appropriate to that ability, which in turn points to the perfection and beauty of the essence and reality worthy of and compatible with the essence and reality. Similarly, just as it is impossible for the perpetual activity beneath the veil of these works to be agentless, so it is by no means possible for even the names whose manifestations and inscriptions are visible to the eye on this creation to be without attributes;  And since it is impossible for attributes such as power and will, which are felt at the level of observation, to be without a purpose, all the works, creatures, and artefacts in this universe, with their innumerable existences, definitively point to the existence of the Creator, the Maker and the actions of their agents, the existence of their names, the existence of their attributes, the existence of their essence, and the necessity of the existence of the sacred essence, so too, the various perfections, distinct beauties and various beauties seen in all of those artefacts point to the existence of the actions, names and attributes of the All-Glorious Maker.  and they testify most clearly and decisively to the infinite perfections and infinite beauties of their beings and their beings, which are unique to them, worthy of them, and in accordance with their necessary and sacred nature, and to their beauties, each exceeding the entire universe in their own right.

  "A child is born weak in every way. Above all, he needs the affection he receives from his parents or caregivers. They are his role models, and he learns many of their habits. Over time, these habits become instinctive and are stored in memory, but he may also acquire wrong habits, such as favoritism towards siblings or other wrong habits. Religion may also be a wrong habit. A child\u0027s mind is not yet fully developed, so how can he choose a religion and learn about God at an early age? For example, reproduction in nature and science is natural. It is very likely that a child will come and worship strange things. For example, if I change my religion, leave my family, travel to a faraway country, get married, and have a child, my child will come and worship my new religion. What a wrong principle in choosing a religion! This is the greatest evidence that God created us with the heart and mind to know God when we grow up. I have a suggestion for you: Food and drink contain happy hormones. Fast for ten full days. Abstain from food and drink until sunset.  Go to your temple and repeat, fast for another ten days, go to the mosque and pray with the congregation. Read in your own language, and that\u0027s fine. Where does peace and tranquility come from when you are in direct communion with God? Life is short. How long will you live? More than a hundred years, and then you will die. Only your work will benefit you. Everyone will abandon you. If you like it, follow my posts and share the post so that everyone can benefit.",

  "‏Evidence of the Corruption of the Christian Religion # Texts about the Crucifixion of Christ ‏1. Matthew 27:25 and Mark 15:25 state that Christ was crucified at the third hour (nine in the morning), while John 19:14-16 states that Christ was crucified at the sixth hour (noon). ‏2. Matthew 27:51-53, Mark 15:38, and Luke 23:45 state that the curtain in the temple was torn at Christ\u0027s crucifixion, while John 19:31-37 does not mention this event. ‏# Texts about the Resurrection ‏1. Matthew 28:1, Mark 16:1, and Luke 24:1 state that the women went to the tomb at dawn, while John 20:1 states that Mary Magdalene went to the tomb in the dark. 2. Matthew 28:2-4, Mark 16:5, and Luke 24:2-4: One or two angels are mentioned at the tomb, while John 20:12 mentions two angels. ‏# Texts about Genealogies ‏1. Matthew 1:1-17 and Luke 3:23-38: Different genealogies of Christ are mentioned, differing in names and order. ‏# Texts about Events ‏1. Matthew 21:1-7, Mark 11:1-7, and Luke 19:28-35: Christ entered Jerusalem on a donkey, while John 12:12-15 mentions Christ entering Jerusalem on a donkey, but without many details. ‏# Explanations for these contradictions ‏1. _Theological interpretations_: Some Christians interpret these contradictions as revealing different aspects of theological truth. ‏2. _Historical analyses_: Some scholars interpret these contradictions as resulting from the historical and cultural traditions of the writers. ‏3. _Differences in narratives_: Some scholars interpret these contradictions as resulting from differences in oral narratives before the Gospel was written. This is why Islam is the truth. Verses from the Quran Here\u0027s the translation of the Arabic verse (Quran 4:46) into English: Among the Jews are those who distort words from their [proper] usages and say, \"We hear and disobey\" and \"Hear, and may you not hear well\" and \"Ra\u0027ina\" [Malfprmed to mean \u0027heed us,\u0027 but can also mean \u0027our evil shepherd\u0027] by twisting their tongues and ridiculing the religion. And if they had said, \"We hear and obey\" and \"Hear and look at us,\" it would have been better for them and more upright; but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they do not believe except for a few. ‏The Quran was preserved by God Almighty, but the Torah and the Bible were preserved by humans, so they were distorted. Here\u0027s the translation of the Arabic verse (Quran 5:44) into English: Indeed, We sent down the Torah, in which was guidance and light. The prophets who submitted [to Allah] judged by it for the Jews, as did the rabbis and scholars by that with which they were entrusted of the Scripture of Allah, and they were witnesses to it. So do not fear the people but fear Me, and do not exchange My verses for a small price. And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed - then it is those who are the disbelievers.",

  "ALLAH Et Ce Qu\u0027il A Créé L’islam Est La Seule Religion Agréée.☝🏼🤍🇵🇸🕊️ L’Islam est la seule et Unique Religion d’ALLAH ; Il n’accepte de Ses serviteurs, hommes ou djinns, aucune autre religion. Le TOUT PUISSANT ☝🏻 a dit à ce sujet : « Et quiconque désire une religion autre que l’Islam ne sera point agréé et se retrouvera dans l’au-delà parmi les perdants » (S. 3, v. 85). De même, « Certes, la religion acceptée d’ALLAH c’est l’Islam. » (S. 3, v. 19) En fait, l’Islam est la religion de tous les Prophètes (Paix Bénédictions et Salut Soient sur Eux) ALLAH Adzawajjel ☝🏼a dit:  \"Et Nous n’avons envoyé avant toi aucun Messager à qui Nous n’ayons révélé : « Point de divinité en dehors de Moi. Adorez-moi donc.» ( 21, v. 25) ALLAH ☝🏼 a également dit « Nous t’avons fait une révélation comme Nous fîmes à Nuh et aux Prophètes après lui. Et Nous avons fait révélation à Ibrâhîm, à Ismâcîl, à Ishâq, à Yacqûb, aux Tribus, à cÎsâ, à Ayyûb, à Yûnus, à Hârûn et à Sulaymân ; et Nous avons donné le Zabûr à Dâwûd. Et il y a des messagers dont Nous t’avons précédemment raconté l’histoire, et des messagers dont Nous ne t’avons point raconté l’histoire - et ALLAH a parlé à Mûsâ de vive voix - en tant que messagers, annonciateurs et avertisseurs, afin qu’après la venue des messagers, il n’eut pour les gens point d’argument devant ALLAH. Et ALLAH est Puissant et Sage » (S. 4, v. 163-165) Dans une autre série de versets, ALLAH (Soubhan\u0027Allah Wa\u0027Ta àla) a dit, après avoir mentionné Noé, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Salomon, Job, Joseph, Moïse, Aaron, Zacharie, Jean-Baptiste, Jésus, Elie, Ismaël, Elisée, Jonas et Lot [Paix sur Eux]  à Son Prophète (e) : « Voilà ceux qu’ALLAH a guidés : suis donc leur direction » (S. 6, v. 90) Les religions des Prophètes (Paix sur Eux) sont identiques dans leurs fondements et divergent dans certaines règles secondaires, mais pas toutes. Ainsi, les détails changent d’un prophète à l’autre mais pas les fondements. Par exemple, ALLAH☝🏼a envoyé Moïse et Jésus comme messagers au sein des enfants d’Israël, en abrogeant – par l’Evangile révélée à Jésus – certains éléments contenus dans la Thora révélée à Moise (Paix sur lui). Jésus( Sidna Issa) dit à son peuple : « Et je confirme ce qu’il y a dans la Thora révélée avant moi, et je vous rends licite une partie de ce qui vous était interdit. J’ai apporté un signe de votre Seigneur, Craignez donc ALLAH et obéissez-moi » (S. 3, v. 50) Moise et Jésus sont donc deux Prophètes envoyés à une même communauté et, malgré cela, certaines branches de leurs religions respectives sont différentes. Que dire alors des différences entre des prophètes de peuples différents ?! Ensuite vint une période où aucune législation ne put échapper à la falsification, ALLAH Éxalte Soit-il a dit: \"Et il y a parmi eux certains qui roulent leur langue en lisant le Livre pour faire croire que cela provient du Livre, alors qu’il n’est point du Livre; et ils disent : ceci vient d’ALLAH , alors qu’il ne vient point d’ALLAH. Ils disent sciemment des mensonges à l’encontre d\u0027ALLAH.\" (S. 3, v. 78) Et ALLAH ☝🏼 a dit : \"…ils détournent les mots de leur sens...\" (S. 4, v. 46) La vérité devint alors inaccessible à l’immense majorité des hommes, comme ALLAH l’avait décidé. Et puisque la voie de la réforme ne pouvait se matérialiser par autre qu’une nouvelle prophétie, ALLAH a RÉTABLI SA RELIGION de VÉRITÉ par la PROPHÉTIE de MUHAMMAD (Aleyhi Salât Wa Salâm). Ainsi, il n’est pas d’Islam ni de religion véritable autre que la sienne : Et quiconque désire une religion autre que l’Islam ne sera point agréé, et se retrouvera, dans l’au-delà, parmi les perdants (S. 3, v. 85) LE TOUT PUISSANT ☝🏼 a fait de Son APPEL, un Message pour TOUS les PEUPLES, Hommes et Djinns, Arabes et Non Arabes : Et Nous ne t’avons envoyé qu’en tant qu’ANNONCIATEUR et AVERTISSEUR pour TOUTE l’HUMANITÉ (S. 34, v. 28) Abû Hurayrah (qu\u0027Allah l\u0027agrée) relate que le Messager d\u0027Allah (sur lui la paix et le salut) a dit : « Par Celui qui détient l\u0027âme de Muḥammad dans Sa Main ! Quiconque de cette communauté, juif ou chrétien, entend parler de moi puis meurt, sans croire en ce avec quoi j\u0027ai été envoyé, fera partie des gens de l\u0027Enfer ! »  Pour ce faire, ALLAH Soubhan\u0027Allah Wa\u0027Ta àla a PROTÉGÉ le CORAN de la Falsification En VÉRITÉ, c’est Nous qui avons fait descendre LE RAPPEL (LE CORAN), et c’est Nous qui en sommes Gardien (S. 15, v. 9) Le Savoir Parfait Appartient à ALLAH عزّ وجلّ, et notre dernière invocation est qu\u0027ALLAH, Seigneur des Mondes, soit Loué et que Paix Bénédictions et Salut soient sur notre Prophète Mohammed صلّى الله عليه وآله وسلّم, ainsi que sur sa Famille, ses Compagnons et ses Frères jusqu\u0027au Jour de la Résurrection.

Quiconque associe à ALLAH (d\u0027autres divinités) ALLAH lui interdit le Paradis; et son refuge sera le Feu. Et pour les injustes, pas de secoureurs !  (Sourate 5/Verset 72) Il dit également :  Ils ont pris leurs rabbins et leurs moines, ainsi que le Christ fils de Marie, comme Seigneurs en dehors d\u0027ALLAH, alors qu\u0027on ne leur a commandé que d\u0027adorer un DIEU UNIQUE. Pas de divinité à part Lui ! Gloire à Lui ! Il est au-dessus de ce qu\u0027ils [Lui] associent.  (Sourate 9/Verset 31) Il dit :  Les infidèles parmi les gens du Livre, ainsi que les Associateurs, ne cesseront pas de mécroire jusqu\u0027à ce que leur vienne la Preuve évidente (Sourate 98/Verset 1) Le Savoir Parfait Appartient à ALLAH عزّ وجلّ, et notre dernière invocation est qu\u0027ALLAH, Seigneur des Mondes, soit Loué et que Paix Bénédictions et Salut Soient sur notre Prophète Mohammed صلّى الله عليه وآله وسلّم, ainsi que sur sa Famille, ses Compagnons et ses Frères jusqu\u0027au Jour de la Résurrection.

  "La mission prophétique du prophète Mohammed (Aleyhi Salât Wa Salâm) est mentionnée dans la Torah et l\u0027Évangile. ALLAH, exalté soit-Il, dit (sens du verset) : Ceux qui suivent le Messager, le Prophète illettré qu\u0027ils trouvent écrit (mentionné) chez eux dans la Thora et l\u0027Évangile. [...] (Coran 7/157). Les juifs et les chrétiens reconnaissent la mission prophétique de Mohammed (Aleyhi Salât Wa Salâm). ALLAH, exalté soit-Il, dit (sens du verset) : \"Ceux à qui Nous avons donné le Livre, le reconnaissent comme ils reconnaissent leurs enfants. Or, une partie d\u0027entre eux cache la vérité, alors qu\u0027ils la savent ! (Coran 2/146)\" Par ailleurs, nous attirons votre attention sur le fait que l\u0027Évangile a été en grande partie falsifié et altéré. La preuve la plus claire de cela est les contradictions qui s\u0027y trouvent aujourd\u0027hui. Toutefois, malgré cela, les chercheurs ont trouvé que l\u0027Évangile mentionne jusqu\u0027à aujourd\u0027hui Mohammed (Paix et bénédictions d\u0027ALLAH soit sur Lui).  Voici quelques exemples de cela : - Le cheikh Abd al-Madjîd al-Zandânî a dit dans son livre intitulé al-Bachârât Bi Muhammad () Fî al-Kutub al-Samâwiyya al-Sâbiqa : L\u0027Évangile de Barnabé mentionne dans son chapitre 22 : \"Il en sera ainsi jusqu\u0027à la venue du comblé d\u0027éloge (Mohammed) le messager d\u0027Allah qui dévoilera alors cette duperie à ceux qui croient en la Loi de Dieu.\" Le livre d\u0027Ésaïe mentionne : O toi le comblé d\u0027éloge (Mohammed), j\u0027ai loué ton nom. O saint du Seigneur, ton nom existe depuis l\u0027éternité. Le livre d\u0027Habacuc mentionne : Dieu est venu de Théman, Le Saint est venu de la montagne de Paran... Pause. La beauté du comblé d\u0027éloge (Mohammed) illumine les cieux et sa louange remplit la terre. Le livre d\u0027Ésaïe mentionne : Je ne donnerai à personne d\u0027autre ce que je lui ai donné. Ahmad, le digne de louanges [NdT: autre nom du Prophète ()] louera à nouveau Allah et viendra de la meilleure contrée de la terre. Toute la création se réjouira de lui, on proclamera l’unicité de Dieu sur toute élévation, on le glorifiera sur toute colline. - L\u0027ancien archevêque de Mossoul, qu\u0027Allah a guidé vers l\u0027Islam, et qui est le professeur Abdul Ahad Dâwûd al-Âchûrî a dit : L\u0027expression répandue chez les chrétiens : \"Gloire à Dieu au plus haut des cieux et paix sur la terre aux hommes qu\u0027il aime.\" ne se disait pas comme cela, mais bien : \"Gloire à Dieu au plus haut des cieux, que l\u0027Islam soit sur la terre et aux gens Ahmad.\" (Muhammad Fî al-Kitâb al-Muqaddas) 3- L\u0027Évangile selon Jean mentionne en citant \u0027Isâ (Jésus), ‘, qui s\u0027adresse à ses disciples : Cependant je vous dis la vérité : il vous est avantageux que je m\u0027en aille, car si je ne m\u0027en vais pas, le consolateur ne viendra pas vers vous ; mais, si je m\u0027en vais, je vous l\u0027enverrai. Le terme consolateur vient du terme Grec paraclet lui-même étant dérivé du terme original paracletos qui signifie Mohammed ou Ahmad (). Il existe encore bien d\u0027autres textes indiquant la venue de Mohammed () dans l\u0027Évangile L\u0027ISLAM ET LA RELIGION DE TOUS LES PROPHÈTES DE NOTRE SEIGNEUR TOUT-PUISSANT ALLAH ☝🏼🇵🇸🤍🤍🕊️",

  "Hello, I a 17-year-old girl from Ethiopia reaching out for help. I was a dedicated student in 11th grade, excelling especially in Math, but I had to stop learning because my family could no longer afford it, and we often go without food. My current situation is incredibly difficult. My mother is ill and unable to work, my father is going crazy and now lives on the streets, and my younger brother risks being unable to take his final exam if we don\u0027t pay his school fees. He is also bullied for our old clothes, which breaks my heart. The stress of our situation has become so overwhelming that, at times, I\u0027ve felt hopeless and even considered ending my life, but I knew I could never do that to my mother and brother. Growing up, we experienced happiness before my father began struggling with alcoholism and drug use, leading to difficult times. Now, our family faces significant hardship, and my mother\u0027s family constantly bullies us. I don\u0027t want to see my mother crying anymore, and I feel lost and don\u0027t know what to do. It\u0027s as if fate itself is against us, and I\u0027m so tired of this life. I dream of working to support my family, of giving my brother a better life, and of becoming an actress or a law student, but I don\u0027t know where to start. I don\u0027t have anybody I can ask for money, and I\u0027m desperate for help. It feels like no one wants to help me, and I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m trying for anymore. Please, someone, anyone, if you care at all, please help me. I don\u0027t know what to do.",

  "A child is born weak in every way. Above all, he needs the affection he receives from his parents or caregivers. They are his role models, and he learns many of their habits. Over time, these habits become instinctive and are stored in memory, but he may also acquire wrong habits, such as favoritism towards siblings or other wrong habits. Religion may also be a wrong habit. A child\u0027s mind is not yet fully developed, so how can he choose a religion and learn about God at an early age? For example, reproduction in nature and science is natural. It is very likely that a child will come and worship strange things. For example, if I change my religion, leave my family, travel to a faraway country, get married, and have a child, my child will come and worship my new religion. What a wrong principle in choosing a religion! This is the greatest evidence that God created us with the heart and mind to know God when we grow up. I have a suggestion for you: Food and drink contain happy hormones. Fast for ten full days. Abstain from food and drink until sunset.  Go to your temple and repeat, fast for another ten days, go to the mosque and pray with the congregation. Read in your own language, and that\u0027s fine. Where does peace and tranquility come from when you are in direct communion with God? Life is short. How long will you live? More than a hundred years, and then you will die. Only your work will benefit you. Everyone will abandon you. If you like it, follow my posts and share the post so that everyone can benefit.",

  "Para empezar Starboys significa algo así como Estrella 🌟 Celebridad, la canción es posiblemente una descripción de la vida del Cantante, en donde Él se jacta de todos los beneficios que el dinero 💰 hizo asenso a la fama atraves de sus fans le han otorgado. La letra es algo complicada para entender, no pienses que para el estadounidense promedio le es fácil comprender una letra haci. Voy a  explicar las partes en donde se  necesita una explicación más amplia y luego puedes ver toda la letra con su significado. En la canción Él habla bastante de carros lujosos una aparente obsesión del Cantante. Se mencionan estos modelos: El McLaren P1, El Lamboryini Aventador SV Roadster y El Bentley Mulsanne. P1 Cleaner than your church shoes, significa que el McLaren P1  que Él tiene es más limpio que los zapatos 👞 que te pones para ir a la iglesia.⛪️  Milli es una abreviación de Million(Millón) Milli point two ( Un Millón punto Do ) que es una forma de decir Un Millón Docientos Mil Dolares 💵 aqui Él se refiere al costo del McLaren P1.   Milli a point two just to hurt you que significa Un Millón Docientos Mil solo para hacerte sentir mal. Lamb es una abreviación de Lamboryini. El All red Lamb es un Lamboryini todo de rojo. All red Lamb\u0027  just to tease you. Es una abreviación de  Un Lamboryini todo de rojo solo para molestarte. None of these toys on lease, too. Que es una abreviación de: Ninguno de estos juguetes son arrendados, también. Aqui Él está dando a entender que el los a comprado en efectivo. Pull off in that Roadster SV. Significa Yo salgo en este Lamboryini Roadster SV; aqui sea omitido el pronombre I am cosa que va a ser a menudo durante la canción. En la siguiente línea dash se refiere al  dash board, que se refiere al tablero del carro en donde esta el belocimetro, aqui Él está diciendo que Él está yendo a Cien millas por hora, que serían aproximadamente 161 Kilómetros por hora. 100 on the dash get me close to God, que significa yendo a Cien millas por hora me acerco a Dios; quizás dando a entender que su vida corre peligro a esa extrema velocidad ó que se siente como un dios al alcanzar esa velocidad. I\u0027m in the blue Mulsanne bumping  New Edition; significa Estoy en el Debli Mulsanne Azul escuchando a todo volumen New Edition. New Edition fue una banda de Afroamericanos populares en los años 80",

WAKE UP. This guy is promoting a way of life that creates hell for children. How is that \u0027cool\u0027? Or hip. It aint. Its about seducing you into destroying lives. And the music is very effective but thats the outcome. You go on a pleasure cruise, come out old and wrinkly. With a legacy that you destroyed your own children and you now get to see them as broken adults whilst you face all the pains of old age. You see your legacy before you.

  "So there\u0027s this lore between \"Can\u0027t Feel My Face\", \"Tell Your Friends\", \"The Hills\", and \"Starboy\". I\u0027d like to explain it time-wise The Hills: The Weeknd crashes the car probably indicating he had no hope in life. Then he walks to his home, to find out there\u0027s a red headed man/the devil, and wants to strike a deal.  Cant Feel My Face: The Weeknd ends up at a bar, nobody really likes him, until the devil shows up, and throws a lighter at him. This is the deal being done by the devil from The Hills, and this means that The Weeknd has sold his soul for fame.  Tell Your Freinds: It starts off with a bush, probably indicating that The Weeknd has prayed to God, wanting to be forgived. Then he buries his old self (the one who striked a deal with the devil for fame), and walks away. It turns out the devil was following him, and then The Weeknd shoots him. Indicating that the devil is finally gone.  Starboy: finally, after getting rid of the devil, he gets rid of his signature haircut, and kills his old self. The Weeknd ended up destroying his accomplishments by using the cross so that the devil wont come after him. After everything, he drives away, hoping for a new life.",

  "My almost 19 year old son, and 18 year old daughter, are both going thru this very thing right now. My son has dating the neighbor girl about a thre-quarter mile down the road since they were about 13-4, ever since he took her their 8th grade dance. My daughter started dating a nice young man who lived in town who she had homeroom with her Freshman year. First relationships, first kisses, first feelings, etc for them both. They have both been moping around for the last week feeling pretty down and trying to figure it out. They both feel \"trapped\" in the situation, since they ALL share the same friends, since grade school, all know the same people, go to the same places, etc. And everyone also knows everyone\u0027s business and all of the details of the breakups. Its by no means easy, whether you are 18 or 19, 25 or 30, or 45 or 50, to break up in a small town.",

  "🥰❤謝謝你❤感謝你愛心💯💯💯❤尊敬佩服❤鞠躬 財運         捨方能得，不捨不得，捨即佈施。1.財佈施得財富。         2.法佈施。凡是別人想知道、想學習的合于正道的方法，只要自己懂、自己會，就熱心去教，能夠得聰明智慧的果報。         3.無畏佈施。即在眾生身心不安、恐懼害怕時，能夠幫助其消除恐懼，如此會得健康長壽的果報。         曾有一個學員功德很大，自己捐助了許多貧困的孩子，家裡還養了八個孩子，親生的卻只有兩個。離婚後跟她婆婆說：「我什麼都沒給過妳，我給妳買處房子。」就將僅有的幾萬塊錢奉獻給了婆婆，之後她每年仍堅持過年過節及婆婆生日去孝敬婆婆，很令人感動。此外，她每年都要親自去貧困地區捐款，送一些衣物。她當初沒錢，從一個拾破爛的到今天有了自己的生意，並有兩處房子，這都是捨來的。         貪小便宜吃大虧的道理。這個易經太極圖，出去的是一個魚尾巴，回來的卻是一個大腦袋。要是貪小便宜，等到明年吃虧就比今年大。         什麼叫貪小便宜？比如把單位的信封、信紙等東西帶回家，單位分東西時先挑好的，為講價錢跟做小買賣的爭吵等等。古人曾訓誡：「于肩挑小販、苦力，莫討便宜。」         貪心過重的表現，讓人賺不到什麼錢，那他們怎麼活？社會怎麼發展？ 提示：你要求別人的時候，你要先付出，因果才能成立。         你怎麽樣對人，人亦會怎麼樣對你。人與人交往一定要守時，你不守時要求別人守時沒有道理。欠人東西一定要還的，欠人時間也一樣要還的。人家要你幫助時，你常說等一下，你自己去辦事就不要怪別人要你等一下了。         改造命運只能靠自己改。         逢人要說好話，這是別人對你說好話的因。每天對人施捨笑容，施捨好話，可以使身邊的人身心安樂，這也是行善！         有一個老人特別省，我到他家一看，全是破爛堆，他還說：「我勤儉節約」。我說：「你家倒楣事也多。」他說：「是，我也不知道怎麼回事。」「你貪心啊！有捨不得的心，財運就不行。」他問：「那我怎麼變財運？」「你把家裡的破爛捨一捨、賣一賣，支援國家建設。」他問：「靈嗎？」我說：「靈！」他把破爛賣完了，他兒子多年沒找到工作，結果找著了。 舉一個例子：        上了公共汽車，一元錢。剛好，只有一張十元，放了十元進投幣箱，感覺我的十元沒有白花，那你種了9元錢的種子。 提示：捨的時候不太樂意，得的時候也會困難，這是現實中眾多的人為什麼來錢那麼困難的原因。 「好讀書，不求甚解」。這是一句好話，現代人不明白這個也是讀書捷徑。選一些好書給還沒有上小學的小朋友讀，不要解釋，讓他們每天讀，慢慢他們就能夠背下來，背下來後還要每天早晚讀，慢慢心中就會平靜下來，產生定力；心有定力，知識才能轉化為智慧，為自己所用。         科學家曾做了一個試驗，把一支玻璃試管插入水的容器內，然後，收集人們在不同心態下的「氣水」，結果發現了：當一個人心平氣和時呼出的氣體變成水後，澄清透明，無色；悲痛之時水中有少許白色沉澱；生氣時則有紫色的沉澱。當他們把受試者生氣時呼出的「生氣水」，注射到一隻大白鼠身上，幾分鐘後大白鼠就死了。         免疫力可以通過身體鍛煉等多種途徑得以增強，但是，人心理的平靜度才是免疫力的本源。         發怒是「火燒功德林」，將你以前辛苦積累的福德化為灰燼。特別是針對自己的時候，千萬不能起嗔恨心。用別人的錯誤來懲罰自己，損失太大了！ 生氣恨心者命還是不好，悲傷完了並不生氣者，命運會很快好轉，事業開始轉運。 氣恨心重的人命多悲慘，隨和謙讓的人命特好，得天之道。若生氣恨心，以後就會發生一件生氣的事，若天天如此，堆積太多了，災害必降。         有的女孩問我怎麼變漂亮，我說：「天天微笑，三年以後必見成效。」        老人窮，我教他參：     1.「我不應該受不了好」。受不了好就是跟自然力較勁，給錢不要，自然力就不給你了，不給你又生氣又埋怨：「我怎麼這麼窮、這麼苦？」   2.多參自己說的過頭話，「爭取變成好東西，好東西沒錢。」 3.「有那麼多錢有什麼用？我夠吃夠喝就得了。」心口如一，自然力會保佑這樣的人，心口不一。自然力讓你夠吃喝，有事時沒錢。 4.「我不應該看不上別人。」 你看不上別人，別人就看不上你的店。 5.「我不應該跟人較勁」。 你較勁，客戶就跟你較勁。 6.人不能有私心，發財應該先祝願客戶都能得到滿意的結果，能給他們帶來優質的服務和美好的回憶。 書名：周老師講心法 好書：弟子規。         于道光先生說：某夜，有個書生路過東嶽廟，有個人竟然從緊閉的廟門中穿了出來，書生便撲向前去，跪倒在地，嘴巴還直嚷嚷著：神明顯靈啦！那人立刻伸手將他攙扶起來，並對他說道：「這位仁兄誤會了，我並不是你口中所謂的神明，我是右臺司鏡官，出差到此來遞送統計資料的。」 「莫非就是在管理那面辨別世間善惡的業力鏡嗎！」 「你剛才所提的業力鏡，顯現的人表現在外的善行與惡事。」 「諸天神明便決議，將原來業力鏡移到左臺，用來顯現人的作為；再於右臺增設這一面心鏡，讓人可以清楚地看到他們的內心。清澈潔淨如水晶的人，就是千中選一。而我的工作就是當人面對心鏡時，從旁記錄鏡中所顯現的一切，每三個月一次，將所記的資料送到東嶽大帝座前，作為降罪賜福的依據。至於這降罪賜福的標準，則是名氣越大，對其要求自然也就越高、越嚴；掩飾的伎倆越是精細，那麼處罰也就越重。」         書生聽完後，便再三向神官拜謝。 作者 紀曉嵐        德澤蔭後         宛平縣有個陳鶴齡。他弟媳要求分家另居。弟媳說：「大哥你是一個男子漢，能多方經營。我只是一個寡婦女流，子女又小，請你把家產分給我三分之二。」         陳鶴年說：「弟媳說的是，應當依從她。」         弟媳又以孤寡不能出去追索欠債為藉口，要求再把現有財貨分成兩份，而把多年以來債主尚未償還的債券，加上利息，作為鶴齡應得的那一份，鶴齡也委屈地應承下來了。後來那些債券，大部分都沒辦法索取，鶴齡因此陷入極端貧困之中。這是乾隆丙午（1786）年發生的事。         這一年，鶴齡的兒子陳三立，在鄉試考中舉人。我有一位同年名叫李步玉，他和陳鶴齡住處相近，得知三立考中舉人，說：「皇天終究還是沒有虧待好心的人。」 淳樸得福         御史胡牧亭先生講了一個故事：他的家鄉有一位富翁，這人並不善於賺錢謀生，但他的財富總像是用不完，他不懂得調養身體，但他一輩子也沒得過什麼大病，有時碰到災禍，也會意外得到解決。         一次，偶然有人扶乩召仙，鄉人就以這個疑問來請教乩仙。         乩仙判語說：「這位富翁上輩子，他淳樸敦厚，絲毫沒有與人計較之心；他悠悠忽忽，從來沒有患得患失之慮；他雖然落落漠漠，但待人平等，心中無愛無憎；他襟懷坦蕩，總是直心直行，無偏無私。有人欺侮他，他不與之爭競；有人欺騙他，他不心生巧詐；有人以惡言誹謗他，他既不心懷嗔恨，也不嗔怒於人；有人捏造罪狀陷害他，他也不報復。一生平庸，老死於茅舍，並沒有什麼功德，獨有那顆淳樸善良的心，卻為神明所欣賞，所以降福於他，使他今生終身幸福。」         胡先生所講的這個故事，從情理上說，世間倒真有這種情況。 書名   紀曉嵐寫的因果故事 1.為人施捨財物，救急扶危 叫做善，行善的人，將來準富，因為天不虧人。 2.天理是，明中施捨，暗裏天還，為了義舉盡心竭力，任勞任怨，叫做功，有功於世的人，會有權柄，因為捨己為人是出貴的根。 3.人借行善立功，把性情練得爐火純青。遇逆境都能和顏悅色地忍受，死心化性，才叫做德。有德性的人，才能立住萬古。             因為救人的性是一救萬古。人能做到善功德三個字，就是聖賢了。             好佔便宜的人長陰命（造惡業）；好生怨氣的人消宿命（損福報）；好動性（耍脾氣）的人，消天命（損智慧）。         怨人是苦海，越怨心裏越難過，以致於不是生病，就是招禍。 笑不但除病還能轉命 生氣容易上火，哪能不生病呢？若能不怨人，可以解無量的冤。找好處能生啟發力，能接萬人緣，是消因果的根。 書名   王鳳儀善人行道實錄 歡迎翻印 成為「富翁」的三個要項： 1.多存錢： 也就是「做好事」及「存好心」。 2.少花用： 在心念上要「除惡念」。 在行為上能「少享福」。 3.提高利率（或報酬率）： 【心量放大】，念念為廣大眾生！不斷淨化心靈，放下放下再放下！ 祈願每個人在這個宇宙銀行裡，都能成為大富翁！ 書名   最大銀行 作者   丞捷",

Sono cresciuta dai 14 ai 20 anni ( anno in cui mi sono trasferita a Londra con mia zia la sorella di mio padre e suo marito ) Mia zia mi ha aiutata in tutto e fatta crescere eppure mai e poi mai avrebbe accettato che io la chiamassi mamma perché mi ha sempre detto che io i miei genitori li avevo e quindi l’ho sempre considerata più madre di mia madre biologica ma per suo volere l’ho sempre chiamata zia . Poi arriva Chiara che in tre anni ha permesso che Alessandro “ adottasse “ Lara che lo chiamasse papà ( poi si è scoperto che fosse un’altra balla ) Milena era diventata un genitore che cresceva le figlie quando se l’era messa in casa senza nemmeno averla mai incontrata e ora c’è Checca che è la madre two . Chiara sei vergognosa .  Te lo dico con il cuore .  E più vergognosa di te ci sono i nonni partenti e materni e i padri di queste figlie che assecondano ogni scempio che metti in scena .",

Ask a question The Weeknd via Billboard Genius Answer 1 contributor The vibe on “Starboy” comes from that hip-hop culture of braggadocio, from Wu-Tang and 50 Cent, the kind of music I listened to as a kid. Bragging just sounds good, man. I was a teenager when I saw Scarface, and even though it was ­unbelievable, it’s kind of cool Tony Montana could survive all those gunshots and not feel them. Where can I watch the video? Genius Answer 2 contributors Or click on the song page header. How did this Daft Punk and the Weekend collab come to be? What certifications did this track receive? Is there a live performance of this song? Is there an official lyric video for this song? Who produced “Starboy” by The I Feel It Coming 9.

To stay on the right path we need to dedicate ourselves to truth and reason, What daryl James elena danaan and Steven m greer, linda moulton howe david gresuch says definitely is our reality and resonates with me and the Intel of other whistleblowers things such as forced monogamy is a social structure forced upon mankind which is unnatural  You can love many people and have many soul mates the key is to make sure you alaways act and live by benevolence if someone is living their best life and not doing anything morally questionable you should not have a problem with it you should support that as love Is unconditional , universal law, principles/morals are dignity integrity honesty honour liberty,if you dont live  and act by these morals you cant call yourself a good person noone can love also encompasses everything good such as happiness health prosperity knowledge etc we should all be ethical vegans for ethical and scientific purposes although everything is living  blood contains the chemicals released when people fear and suffer eggs are fine as long as the hen has not had  sex with a rooster as chickens lay eggs naturally  I invoke divine energy and benevolent source and wish everyone and everything in time and space infinite strengthening physically mentally spiritually. And wish everyone and everything in time and space infinite love, peace, justice, healing, protection. To include  everything  I wrote and mean I just say I invoke divine energy benevolent source and pray/wish that the thought that dwells in the light is with everyone and everything in the cosmos,  time and space infinitely. this is the most powerful prayer/spell we should say this incantation everyday hopefully the world will go in the direction of conservation and holistic therapies",

Was just jamming hard to this song when it first dropped thinking J Cole dope, Beyonce still fine AF as always and that they made a banger then continuing to coexist as artists respectfully. But then all along J Cole dodged a bullet being ballsy enough to expose what he’s seen while Beyonce was actually part of the elite doing shady sht or at least aware of what’s Jay Z and Diddy been doing all along controlling and exploiting the music scene under even bigger fish pulling the strings shaking up the whole industry. Song’s still a banger but it hits different now over a decade later. Really is such an interesting world we live in.",

Lots. Of. Killing. OUR OWN FAMILIES. I feel you. Our family war was 1949 -1951 after the second world war. Around 5,000 people and Soldiers died. 2 factions began from that and may or may not exist tiday that you may or not have heard of. Anyways, your video becomes alive to anyone that has been down the path and had to flee to stay alive. Its bad right now but it\u0027s the same story that any other war has been fought over..

  "Poor guy is a hater, huh? Sounds like he wants to be in the cool world spitting some shiny words with ele. Vocal enhancements. Many negative words going out in the airwaves. Sure it makes this the Weeknd feel better to share his tuffness. Or it\u0027s all just weird actors. In that case, music is a domestic terrorist. See when I can hear it in places of business, vehicles driving around. Too attitude from people that get hypnotized by foreigners. For real Americas Americans would speak up and help any and all. But we can\u0027t even take care of our own kids. School and what..  that\u0027s not life. No real substance in the music. Japan now they got some music. Don\u0027t give up America just sit back and let everybody else handle it. Paid to sing 😅. Singing to live. Live to sing and bring others into the number. But, get real work completed. Every job has an ending, even harvesting like Adam and Cain. Production shall always be. It\u0027s the cycle of life. You have robotics.... I just want you all to stop tripping. You making this country look weak and dumb you\u0027re also a bunch of murderers here at the things you\u0027ve done covid and more weapons be honest you\u0027re in debt America. I like to get out of this country and go through a summer responsible. Pretending that everything is cool, is irresponsible and shows our children what is right is wrong. I\u0027m not here to join in and play with the kids like you sickos are. Trust me I know all about making a little kid games and made a whole bunch of my schools. I am me, love kids, love parents/adults, just not me. So, anyway, mentally screw with kids, it be easier if you want to give up cuz this country is really knew this is all new shitt so if you think you\u0027re tough s*** hot s*** hit me up and see what it talks to talk to you man I\u0027m a man",

  "Romans 3:23 “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” 1 Corinthians 15:3-7 “For I passed on to you as most important what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve. Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers and sisters at one time; most of them are still alive, but some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.” 1 Peter 2:24 “He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree; so that, having died to sins, we might live for righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.” John 3:16-17 “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.” 1 John 3:8 “He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.” Acts 3:19-20 “REPENT, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, and that he may send the Messiah, who has been appointed for you—even Jesus.” (NIV) Acts 2:38 Peter replied, “REPENT and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.” May the Lord Jesus Christ save the lost souls today.",
  "100% PROOF THAT CHRISTIANITY IS TRUTH *1.) 2000+ FULFILLED BIBLE PROPHECIES: Here are some prophecies that the Bible sound would come to pass before the End Times. (1.) The future will like days of Sodom. (Luke 17:28–30) This is exactly what we see today with gay marriage laws and strong public support for the homosexual lifestyle. Don’t support sin whether it’s fornication or sodomy. Sin leads souls to hell. Warn the people so they will repent and be saved from hellfire. (2) People will deny that GOD created the universe and that He judged them through Noah’s flood. (2 Peter 3:3, 5, 6)  This is exactly what we see happening.  Atheists are now claiming that the universe created itself. (3) The message of the Gospel will reach all the nations. (Matthew 24:14)  Remember that Christianity only started out with a few dozen followers.  The Bible prophesying that its message will reach the world is proof of its divine inspiration. (4) Christians will be hated and killed just because of their faith. (Matthew 24:9)  This is exactly what we see happening today.  Christians in the Middle East are being beheaded just because they are Christians. (5) Jews will return to Israel, their homeland. (Ezekiel 34:13) (6) Israel will be a nation for the 3rd time. (Amos 9:14-15)    (7) The future will become frightening. (Luke 21:26) (8) Blasphemy will be commonplace. (2 Timothy 3:1, 2)    (9) There will be money hungry preachers that deceive Christians and lead them away from the truth. (2 Peter 2:1-3) (10) Scoffers will mock the Second Coming by claiming these signs have always been around. (2 Peter 3:3, 4) WE KNOW THAT THE BIBLE IS FROM GOD BECAUSE IT HAS CORRECTLY PREDICTED THE FUTURE TIME AND TIME AGAIN 2.) FACTS FROM THE BIBLE THAT HAVE JUST BEEN VERIFIED BY MODERN SCIENCE: (1) The Earth free floats in space. (Job 26:7)  At the time, people thought the earth sat on a large animal. (2) The Earth is round. (Isaiah 40:22)  At the time, people thought the earth was flat. (3) Blood is the source of life. (Leviticus 17:11)  Up until, the 1700s, people were bled because they thought that would get rid of their sickness.  (Genesis 1:15)  They should have listened to the Bible. (4) Women also possess the seed of life 100% PROOF THAT CHRISTIANITY IS THE TRUTH** (5) The time of year, month or day can be found through lights of the moon and sun. (Genesis 1:14) (6) Air has weight. (Job 28:25) (7) Air has a cycle. (Ecclesiastes 1:6) (8) There are hot water vents at the bottoms of deep seas. (Job 38:16)  This fact wasn\u0027t verified until the 20th century with submarine technology. (9) There is a relationship between mental and physical health. (Proverbs 14:30) (10) Diseases can be spread through the air, by contact, etc. (Leviticus 13:46) 3.) THE PRESERVATION OF THE BIBLE: Because we have 5000+ ancient manuscripts of the Bible, we have a great deal of evidence that the Bible has not been changed to make up for prophecies.  The ancient manuscripts date all the way back to 250 BC and verify with the modern Christian Bible.  The oldest of these manuscripts are the Dead Sea Scrolls. Muslims and some skeptics claim that the Bible has been changed but secular historians have verified that the Bible has been preserved.  Since the Bible has not been changed and it has also told the future time and time again, we have evidence that the Bible is divinely inspired. Check out this site to see ancient manuscripts of the Bible:  The manuscripts verify with the modern Bible. 4.) MY NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE: I personally have had an Out of Body/Near Death Experience where my soul left my body and I was ETERNALLY Separated from God for all of ETERNITY! I was sent there because of my WILLFUL SINS. In 1986, a pastor told me that I was forgiven for my past, present and future sins. “Once saved always saved” is false doctrine and is SATAN’S BIGGEST LIE!  HEBREWS 10:26 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins. In the years to come I did not bear any good fruit for the Lord and continued to sin and on JULY 25, 2004, I overdosed on drugs and crossed over. Here is the link to my NEAR DEATH/HELL TESTIMONY.    5.) OTHER NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES AND TESTIMONIES: Near death experiences prove Christianity! We find testimonies of atheists, Buddhists, Muslims, etc. claiming they died, went to hell and came back after they met Jesus. There are countless testimonies just on YouTube and the people that ventured into the afterlife describe the Christian concept of the afterlife.  If NDE’s were open to interpretation, we would find testimonies of people saying that when they died, they met Allah or Muhammad or Buddha.  But since we only find testimonies of people saying they were saved from hell by Jesus, we have additional evidence that Christianity is the truth.  If NDEs were open to interpretation, we would see Muslims hallucinating about Allah while Hindus hallucinating about reincarnation.  But we don’t see this. What we see is the truth of Christianity.  Here are some testimonies:  goo.gl/7tH4VL   goo.gl/ETWntN   goo.gl/M5trPs   goo.gl/fa6rOn   goo.gl/2lm65a Besides the countless testimonies we have of near death experiences, we also have scientific research and evidence that verifies the existence of the afterlife.  Here is a link to studies and research done by respected doctors: near-death.com/science/evidence.html 6.) SUPERNATURAL EXPERIENCES/VISIONS: You can find tons of testimonies online of Jesus appearing to Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, etc. through supernatural visions. Here is the testimony of Jesus revealing Himself to a teen. goo.gl/Q43pym Here are 2 testimonies of Jesus revealing Himself to non-Christians: goo.gl/ryIi0A  goo.gl/vo8le7 Now that you know the afterlife exists, do you know where you are going when you die?  I urge you to come to Jesus Christ TODAY because nobody is guaranteed a tomorrow.  He died so you can be forgiven.  Will you accept His sacrifice?  Believe in Him (JESUS), believe that He came into this world in the flesh and that He died and rose again on the 3rd day. Confess your sins, and turn away from your sins.  Many Christians nowadays believe the lie of once saved always saved.  They think they can commit whatever sin they want and still make it to heaven. Don’t be deceived, REPENTENCE is NECESSARY.  Also, since I’ve personally had a near death experience, I know what happens after a person ventures into the afterlife. CLICK MY LINK TO SEE MY TESTIMONY!   If you’re not covered by the blood of Jesus, you are in big trouble. JOHN 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. ROMANS 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. I don’t want anybody else to go to the place of the dead.  Around 150,000 people die every day.  Don’t play around with your soul, afterlife and your eternity.   (PLEASE COPY/PASTE THIS COMMENT ANYWHERE OR PRINT IT OUT AND GIVE IT TO PEOPLE. HELP BRING AS MANY SOULS AS YOU CAN TO JESUS. FIGHT FOR THE CAUSE. BE OBEDIENT AND LET GOD USE YOU TO HELP GUIDE PEOPLE AWAY FROM HELL)",
