  "This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen. It’s not even cool to joke about the Nazis or use their ideology or phrases out of context. The Nazis planned on not only murdering every single black man and woman on earth, but they also planned on destroying all artifacts or literature that provided info about them, and were going to make it illegal to even speak about them. They were going to erase them from existence. It’s a great disservice to his race to write these lyrics, and hopefully it does not serve to provide minimization of the Nazi party’s evil plan to completely erase non aryan humans off the face of the earth, nor the millions \u0026 millions of people who died at their hands, or died in battle trying to stop it from happening 😢",

  "She’s got a very cool new sound. It’s not really country as some of you say. It’s more southern-mid to maybe Deep South and she has a young voice.  Her Lolita look is perfect.  Her look is reminding me of Mila Kunis, a young Liz Taylor, and a dark haired young Paulina Porizkova.  I still want the poofy hair tutorial Miss Jess. I’ve always thought big teased hair is pretty. I was lucky enough to grow up in the 1980s. Big hair is back!!",

  "got out of a very lengthy relationship(3y) when this song dropped i felt this song deep in my soul “back to my ways like 2019” and i completley derailed a lot of myself while searching for myself. I started listening to this song recently again and just wish i could give the me in this time a hug to tell her i was going to make it out no matter what i did to feel better and that she was going to get theough the pain. the whole “i dont wanna feel like i did last night.” thank you raye for making this beautiful masterpiece that i related to and needed when i didnt think i did. im better now but fuck i was in a dark place",

  "I love how the beginning shows the “mind-numbing and fun” side of substance abuse and self-sabotage, you know what you’re doing but because because you’re high/drunk it’s like “meh, I don’t care”.  But then the contrast and shift in perspective at the ending shows the reality of the situation - that moment of clarity after everything when you realise “wtf have I done” and you reap the consequences of your actions, starting the cycle all over again. It’s brilliant and RAYE deserves every award there is",

I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.\" Philippians 4:6–7 (NIV) Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Psalm 34:4–5, 8 I sought the LORD, and He answered me and delivered me from all my fears. Those who look to Him are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed. Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good! Blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him! Romans 8:28 And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to His purpose. Joshua 1:9 \"Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.\" Matthew 6:31–34 (NIV) \"So do not worry, saying, \u0027What shall we eat?\u0027 or \u0027What shall we drink?\u0027 or \"What shall we wear?\u0027 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.\"",

This would be like a dream job wouldn’t it, like dam… this would be fun not work… imagining signing off on this stuff her writing is truly next level amazing. That got deleted very fast THANKYOU. I had to get it out though it was bursting inside of me. Sometimes if I don’t say or in my case write things I feel like I’ll pop or explode hah my brain anyway 🩷",
  "Pls delete after read! However I love all of RAYE’S work however in a tiny place where I am from the people here would think that every single you post relates to yourself in some way even though I understand the ending about saying no memory you can’t remember you forget sometimes it’s so hard to get your head around it’s your brain blocking something out protecting you would be my guess and therapist have told me. That can happen, but in this tiny place re posting that would cause me a lot of harm. No one is smart enough to see the hurt inside that. It’s a shame I love you Raye I get you",
  "My honest opinion is this, I love every rate does, I understand the whole blocking things out, numb it, block it out you don’t have to feel it unless you go to far to the right then you will fill a lake with tears have to find the right balance from left to the middle with the alcohol. My days of experimenting and opening up my mi d with other things are well and truly OVER my mind is open enough naturally as it is. That’s why I get angry at things that get written printed that are un truths! As I have had things happen to me tablot writing saying different to the actual TRUTHS I have in writing. Where alcohol and prescription meds were only the problem at that time. I figured her to have a LOW body count, however when she did click with someone that she would have amazing, experimental hard sex! Without being a tart so to speak. I mean come on, just because she took a few lefts from the comfort of her home doesn’t mean a thing… how can you possibly get a rep from that .. OR she was the bee’s knee’s until she tells a man she doesn’t want to be with them because she figured out they weren’t a match they were the right vibration, then all of a sudden things go sour out of spite and jealousy.. in a very very small town like where I am from that is usually how it goes, and ruion her name because they don’t want anyone else to take her AND the females get Jelous so let’s do what we can to do harm!

  "Before I say anything at all, I want to be clear I don’t know this artist and I’ve never heard anything else from her. However, I’m not sure who the songwriter is but among lyricists and songwriters that I know personally they give this song a 5-star 10/10 rating for whoever the songwriter is. The lyrics are profoundly interesting, as it tells a story so immaculately while not straying away from its message and feeling. This song even non-recorded (just the written lyrics) could be sold for millions to another artist. Great job 👏",

  "This one is special , she has the passion behind the music , reminds me of old times in the 80’s and 90’s in my era of growth , there was a richness and actual skill beyond auto tune to beautiful music which required actual talent , now the industry has allowed anyone to make music without that passion of skill supporting it’s all about a facade  . It’s lessened the quality and cheapened music , but this young woman has soul , let’s hope with the standards of today she’s appreciated like she deserves to be 🩶",

That what is full of happiness and pleasures for one can be the irreversible life of another, a life of desperation and compulsion... The risks that prisoners of fate, who have long forgotten their own happiness and purpose in making others happy, take to hold on to life on the sidewalks of this land of pleasure where they lose themselves... The attritional battle against the consequences of their own choices on the cruel steps where the survivors, who come out of the door as innocent by losing their senses, start to disgust even themselves... -It is difficult to convey the message one hundred percent in its simplest form, but it is true that it summarizes from beginning to end a dark journey that has unfortunately become a “forced” way of life for too many people today. -A little empathy and good ears can get things into the body that a syringe cannot.",

  "As someone who has been seeing this shit from the inside, this song captures the mood and energy better than any other. No one is able to be themselves(”I don’t trust any of these bitches I’m with”) because their true self is literally the thing most of them are trying to get away from. The way you lose control, you are in random hotel rooms with people you don’t know ”partying” and why? Because you’d follow the coke anywhere.  Almost all of the people I know who do or have done coke, E, K, whatever have been doing it not to boost an existing good feeling but to kill a bad one deep inside. Seriously almost all of them have had some serious issues with themselves.  And girls also please realize the type of danger you put yourselves in when hanging around with random people you meet through drugs. I’ve sadly had to pick up two teary eyed girl friends from the womens clinic at early morning hours after they had evidence scraped out of them. The lifestyle is all glamour, grey goose, designer clothes and rich friends on the outside but rotten, sick, dark and twisted on the inside.",

  "I could be a moron here, and I’m not sure if someone’s already said it, but I honestly think the representation is beautiful. The three blonde women with RAYE I believe represents addiction. At the start of the video, ( 0:31 ) they walk with her to the cab. At the end, ( 3:28 ) they clasp their hands onto her hips, waist, and head. Holding onto her tight. Then at the VERY end, (4:20 ) one picks up her phone, and quickly ends the call with her ‘sis’. If this is supposed to be true, and a representation of addiction, it’s beautiful. Addiction can hold onto you so tightly, it cuts you from your loved ones, your life, mental health, everything. RAYE, you’re a clever woman. Holy shit ❤",

I don\u0027t really know why a song like this which is full of tough matter is such a great hit time and time again but I think I do know now. The way she writes this song, the change in beats, tone of her voice, really does sound like at times she is in a nightmare. This song personally makes me feel a lot about some of the obstacles I am going through but I guess nothing compared to what she went through. What was the situation with her record label. Was she mistreated?",

  "The first time I heard this song was in November 2023. I kept playing it on repeat that day, about 1000 times. At one point, it triggered something inside me. I ran out of the place where I was sitting with some of my close friends.  Everyone was looking for me. They checked the CCTV and searched for me in the direction I had run. They called the cops because they couldn\u0027t find me. The guy who found me saw me running and crying on the highway. He stopped to ask if I was okay and gave me water. He asked my name and if I had anyone with me. When he found out I was alone, he told me he was from out of town for a meeting. He suggested we take a room nearby to clean up, and then he would take me to his home. Suddenly, I realized that this guy could kidnap and harm me, and I started crying. I told him I had a best friend nearby and would go to him instead. He offered to take me there, but I didn\u0027t want to get in his car. So, I made him walk all the way to my best friend\u0027s house. My best friend called everyone to let them know I was safe with him. I\u0027ve never listened to that song since the incident. Music can be very powerful. Today, I decided to hear it again! And I found my other comment from an year ago saying \"on loop 🤯\" 😂😂😂",

  "I love the lyrics cuz of the “in the back of the club sipping champagne” and “in the back of the taxi sniffing cocaine.” None of that makes sense. You’d be sipping champagne on a dance floor, or in a taxi with your friends. Also, you’d be sniffing cocaine somewhere lowkey, like the back of the club (also taxis are unstable for coke). She’s so distraught and inebriated that she is a nonreliable narrator of her surroundings. It’s that added later of lyricism that makes me love this song even more.",

  "I was this girl. So desperate not to feel, so desperate to escape. Running around drinking, partying without a care. Anyone who saw me wouldn’t know I was dying inside. I wouldn’t recognise her today, but I would give her a hug. Now I’m a wife and a mum and I have so much joy in my life.

  "LORE IN LYRICS Sleazin and teasin I’m sittin on him All of my diamonds are drippin on him. I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something  I ordered 2 more wines cuz tonight I want him This says that last night when she was at the night club, she met a man and ordered some wines to try and fizz him up to get him. A little context if you care to listen I find myself in a shit position She is telling us that last night she was in a 💩 position. Getting in a taxi and driving to the nightclub with the b*tches sniffing cocaine for some weird reason. The man that I love sat me down last night, and he told me that it’s over, dumb decision. Her husband/boyfriend/fiancé met with her and saw that Raye was with another guy who she ordered the 2 more wines for and said that their relationship was OVER and I don’t wanna feel that my heart is ripping In fact, I don’t wanna feel so I stick to sipping She didn’t want to feel how sad she was that her man just broke up with her, so she stuck to drinking more wine in hopes of getting rid of that emotion And I’m out in the town with a simple mission, in my little black dress In the shittest setting She had one mission and that was to get her man back. But the setting to do that was 💩 so it was hard. Just a heart broke bitch High heels 6 inch  At the back of the nightclub sipping champagne She is saying that she is a heart broken btch with her heels being 6 inches tall. She was at the back of the nightclub sipping champagne. I don’t trust any of these bitches I’m with at the back of the taxi sniffing c0c@!n€ She was at the back of a taxi while getting there with strangers. She and the strangers were sniffing c0c@!n£ for some reason and idk why😅 Drunk calls Drunk text Drunk tears Drunk s£x She is saying Drunk a lot of times to set the setting of how drunk she eventually got. And it ended up in all these things. Doing drunk calls, doing drunk texts, lead to drunk tears and drunk s£x with the ‘2 more wines guy’ I was looking for a man who was on the same page Symbols that she was looking for a man who was just as drunk as her. On the same page. She had found that someone. (2 more wines guy) Now it’s back to the intro  Back to the bar To the Bentley To the hotel To my old ways She ended up in a loop, she went back to the bar multiple times. Then to the Bentley, hotel then back to her old ways.  Cause I don’t wanna feel how I did last night I don’t wanna feel how I did last night Doctor, doctor anything please, doctor doctor have mercy on me She does NOT want to feel how she did last night. She is yearning for mercy from the doctor, as the alcohol levels were probably damaging her brain or mental stability. Give me my simptoms, doctor, I don’t wanna feel. She is asking for er simptoms from the doctor to hopefully help. Took this joint how I’m blowing this steam Back to my ways like 2019  24 hours since my ex did dead I’ve got a new ma;on me, it’s about to get sweaty She was smoking somewhere and it had been one day since her ex had told her that it’s over. Her 2 more wines guy is now hooked up with her now. Last night really was the cherry on the cake Been s9me dark days lately and I’m finding it crippling  Last night was really the cherry on the cake, recently she has been having some dark days and last night just tops off her bad times recently Excuse my state  I’m tired your hopes You make it to m6 bed Get me hot and sizzlin She was telling 2 wines guy to excuse the state she was in and when they got back she told him to get into her bed to get her hot and sizzlin. Which explains when she said ‘drunk s£x’ earlier. If I take a step back to see the glass half full, atleast it’s the Prada 2-piece that I’m dripping in. She sees that the glass of wine is half full, but atleast she has the prada 2-peice. And I’m already acting like a d!ck, so u might aswell stick in For kids, u will know about this when u r older😊 Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch In the back of the nightclub sipping champagne I don’t trust any of these- I have already talked about this part. Let’s skip to the last part Let’s skip 070 Shakes part since it is so damn annoying and there’s not much lore :) Lipstick smudges like modern art I don’t know where the fuck I am Or who’s driving the fucking car Her lipstick is smudged cuz of all the wine glasses and wine it has touched. She is so drunk she does not know where she is and doesn’t know who is driving the car (I hope it was a taxi driver😅) Speeding down the highway, sippin Mixing pills with the liquor fuck these feelings She has gotten drunk to the point where she is SPEEDING DOWN THE HIGHWAY ( I don’t think it was a taxi driver who was driving 😢) and she has mixed her pills with the liquor thinking it would do something, I think. I lost everyone I love in read, spilling secrets to the stranger in my bed She has lost loved ones on read and has spilled a bunch of secrets to 2 more wines guy I don’t remember nothing so there’s nothing to regret This is a powerful line. She doesn’t remember anything from last night and therefore has nothing to regret Other than this 4/4 kick drum pounding in my head She has 1 thing to regret and that is how hard her ears are ringing. They are probably hurting cuz of way too much champagne. THIS COMMENT TOOK WAY TOO LONG TO TYPE I HOPE WITH WAS USEFUL😊",

People forget, if we, the music buying public don\u0027t support these artists by purchasing their albums or going to their concerts, then their record label will dump them, talented or not.

  "This is awesome, but her version of this on SNL was absolutely mind-blowing. So much more powerful - her voice, so versatile and the way she used it was just incredible- she didn\u0027t show that off so much here - and it was so much more affecting emotionally on SNL- just heart-breaking, particularly that she chose to speak part of it.I know this version is supposed to be more commercial but man, her performance on SNL just blew me away. I thought I was looking at a new once-in-a-lifetime talent (she\u0027s amazing in this recording too but I don\u0027t think it did her justice.) In any case, my jaw just drops at her talent.",

I\u0027m definitely not someone who bothers about asking someone for closure but this time around I found it made more sense to put my pride aside rather than watch myself continue to dwindle in between bed and more tears as I have been doing this past entire week, lamenting over something that actually ended 2 months ago, don\u0027t know why I\u0027ve been trying so hard to block my emotions... Here I am 2 months later with a delayed reaction lol. I find it sickening how I \"lost myself\" and neglected myself amidst this breakup... Might have not gotten to the point of using substances or casual sex but Raye\u0027s song is hitting a lot harder today... I no longer want to feel like this... If you\u0027re going through anything that gets you operating below your usual... Feel it, ditch it, hopefully you snatch yourself really fast before you do anything drastic. Got that out my chest... FINALLY!!!",

I absolutely love her live performances. From the brits, to pop festival, npr tiny desk, and snl. But these studio recordings do not cut it. I want to buy the album but I hate to say it cause I like raye, the vocals don\u0027t do her justice on these recordings and are too studio assisted. I\u0027d buy a live album from her in a heartbeat. As for a studio recorded album no thanks...hopefully she can get it better on the next one",

  "The allure of clubs, drugs, new faces, gambling, and avenues—these became my chosen escapes from the harsh realities of life. They painted a facade of relief, promising a break from the relentless pressure, even if just for a fleeting moment. \"Escapism\" becomes an intimate narrative of this journey, depicting the initial allure of these escapes. The song resonates deeply because it encapsulates the cycle of seeking solace in these self-destructive paths, including the allure of these avenues as a means to numb the overwhelming emotions. Initially, these avenues offered a temporary escape, a brief hiatus from the turmoil within. However, their allure soon faded into a haunting descent into a darker realm. The song serves as a haunting reminder of the dangers in seeking refuge through these self-destructive means, illustrating how they ultimately lead to a darker and more isolated place, intensifying the pain instead of offering genuine relief.",

  "💯 💥 And, I\u0027m a survivor of child sex abuse by priests of the Church of England in South Africa. So, when I first heard Escapism, whilst driving on London\u0027s North Circular, I had to pull over right there, and turn up the volume. This song heals me. Thank you, RAYE. You\u0027ve nailed it. I\u0027m sorry about what happened to you. However, take strength. In this one song, you have sung my old life, and pointed the way forward. So, I now play it on the loop. It\u0027s at once a confession, a validation, and an ultimatum. But, most of all, it\u0027s a victory, and an unapologetic declaration of triumph. Strength and kudos to you, RAYE! You have given us hope with this song to sing along to when the darkness descends. Yes, at first, it was a difficult song to emulate, but, I\u0027m pleased to report that, after a year of practice since its first release, I\u0027m now word-perfect. So, karaoke contest, anyone?

Married 11 years with a 10 year old daughter. My twenties and early thirties are in the past. But this song has a way of allowing me to tap into that repetitive life of a twenty something old who bought i to 3rd wave bs feminism that i should be promiscuous and only look out for myself which as in the song kept me in my doctors office begging for anything to quiet the s reaming in my mind that this was not a fulfilling life. Tune out of the bullshit. Understand that men are not yoyr peoblem. Man hating miserable influential females are. Stop sleeping around. Its not settling. Its coming to the realization that your standards will never suit you the way you belive they will. Stop trying to be equal to men and learn the power and beautiful life embracing the soft, empathetic nuturing woman you are. Thets how you attract the men you want. Love you ladies.

  "this song is incredible. those drums. the beat. her vocals. her writing. the melody. her flow. the lyrics. the lyrics are so real and she sounds like she means every word of what she’s saying. you can tell she’s passionate about music and i’m so happy she’s finding success on her own and her label isn’t holding her back anymore",
  "This is a femenology masrpice👏👏😂",
  "she kinda look like Amy Winehouse",
  "what a fucking banger",

  "❤",
  "She looks fun to chill with",
  "😂",
  "This song is amazing. I loved it first time I heard it. So refreshing seeing talented artists like her. She\u0027s amazing and I hope she keeps going. Gives me Amy winehouse energy even though it\u0027s different type of music",

  "The story in this song depicts one of the lowest positions for a human being. Lack of consciousness, lack of quality social relationships, desire not to feel but desire to escape from reality shaping her/his life. This is one of the ways to say \"Be aware of your lifestyle! Get out of it if it matches with the story told in this song\". This is the actual message of song. Be aware, do not desire it.",
  "If this doesn’t win any award. Like a Grammy or a vma or anything else. I will scream. This deserves song of the decade I don’t care. It’s so deep personal and so modern. Wow.",
  "I\u0027m a little surprised that I don\u0027t see any shout out to \"Dylan Sitts - maybe not\" anywhere, not even in the special thanks section. If you\u0027re going to add lyrics to someone else\u0027s song, least you could do is say thanks or list them as a sample.",

I started bobbing my head, groovin\u0027 to the beat and then I listened to the lyrics and I had to pull over, stop driving, and just to listen to this song. It is profound on so many levels -- lyrically poignant and the music is on point. Brilliant. I\u0027m a fan.",

This lyrics paint a vivid picture of a heartbroken woman seeking solace in the distractions of the nightlife, but ultimately finding little comfort in the superficial pleasures of alcohol, drugs, and casual sex. the seemingly hedonistic tone of the song, it is clear that raye  is struggling with profound feelings of pain and confusion, and is desperately searching for a way to numb the ache in her heart. The repeated refrain of \"I don\u0027t wanna feel how I did last night\" underscores the depth of her anguish, and highlights the importance of finding healthy coping mechanisms to deal with the ups and downs of life.",

  "Español Inglés \"esta canción me ayudó a superar algunos de los capítulos más oscuros de mi vida\".  Les daré algo de contexto para quien quiera escuchar: soy un chico de 23 años que se halla en proceso de rehabilitación. Metanfetamina es la sustancia en cuestión y los motivos van desde: depender del Sexoservicio cómo única fuente de ingresos de mis quince a mis 21 años de edad, pasando por complicaciones en el colon, que me hicieron darme cuenta de mi diagnóstico positivo para VIH, Y llegando a dar por resultado final, el comprarme con dinero de la prostitución, el estigma social por el cuál, la comunidad en donde vivo, se me ha vuelto en contra, haciéndome sentir acoso, violencia de carácter pasivo-agresiva, que sistemáticamente me ha hecho sentir asco por la persona que he sido. Lo más indignante de todo es que Cualquier persona, se sienta con la suficiencia moral, para opinar desde el prejuicio y la ignorancia, argumentando lo mucho que podría dañarles alguien como yo. Porque para ellos, el mounstro soy yo, creo que, nunca lograrán ver las veces que me ha tocado ser la víctima implícita (no presunta) porque a mí sí que me han hecho daño, pero no por ello voy por el mundo jodiendo a los demás. Es una canción que retrata a la perfección con todo lo que he tenido que lidiar, y lo más hermoso es que no necesita señalar a nadie para que el mensaje sea contundente. Me devolvió la indignación y esto es algo bueno, porque era indignarme o deprimirme. Al menos la indicación me inyecta ganas de luchar. Que es mucho más de lo que he venido haciendo. Solo me queda agradecer a Rachel por el hermoso regalo que me dió: una canción que pareciera, esta hecha para mi contexto, gracias a la cual, pude expresar a mis padres, con palabras inocuas e inofensivas, cual es mi sentir. el regalo fue: una comunicación empatica, con unos padres a quienes yo daba por perdidos. no pudo haber mejor regalo  \"this song got me through some of the darker chapters of my life.\" I\u0027ll give you some context for anyone who wants to listen: I\u0027m a 23-year-old guy in the process of rehab. Methamphetamine is the substance in question and the reasons range from: depending on the sex service as the only source of income from my fifteen to my 21 years of age, going through complications in the colon, which made me realize my positive diagnosis for HIV, AND reaching the end result, buying me with money from prostitution, the social stigma for which the community where I live has turned against me, making me feel harassed, passive-aggressive violence, which has systematically Made me feel disgusted by the person I\u0027ve been. The most outrageous thing of all is that anyone feels morally sufficiency to give an opinion based on prejudice and ignorance, arguing how much someone like me could harm them. Because for them, I am the monster, I think, they will never be able to see how many times I have been the implied (not presumed) victim because they have hurt me, but that is not why I go around the world fucking with the the rest. It\u0027s a song that perfectly portrays everything I\u0027ve had to deal with, and the most beautiful thing is that it doesn\u0027t need to point anyone out for the message to be strong. It returned my outrage and this is a good thing, because it was either outraging or depressing me. At least the indication injects me with the desire to fight. Which is much more than what I\u0027ve been doing. I can only thank Rachel for the beautiful gift she gave me: a song that seems to be made for my context, thanks to which I was able to express to my parents, with innocuous and harmless words, what my feelings are. The gift was: an empathic communication, with some parents whom I gave up as lost. there could be no better gift Traducción en vivo Comentarios translate.google.com.mx  › ...

  "\u0027\u0027Escapismo” se trata de huir de la realidad tan rápido como sea posible. Salir solo, ignorando a todos los que tienen su mejor interés en el corazón. Persiguiendo un laberinto de humo y espejos porque la claridad es amargamente intimidante. Cuando estás en tu punto más bajo, es como un modo de supervivencia que te adormece la mente, huyendo de la vida real porque no es algo que quieras ver. Sónicamente grande y dramático, algo para acompañar este sentimiento, para perderse y tal vez puedas encontrar algo de curación dentro de él como lo hice yo.”- Raye Hermosa y bien narrada canción.",

Immediately after this I\u0027m going to look at her older tracks to see when and which song led me to this feeling (a feeling like I\u0027m looking at someone successful from my same class {obviously I don\u0027t know her but I do know she was just getting started} who\u0027s been on the same mission,  but just got word she\u0027s still killing it) Edit well it only took two seconds for me to see she was the one who made the song \"shh\"  which I cant wait to hear again next, I have no memory of the audio just yet but all I remember is that it was definitely a hit to me!!!",

  "🦉✨: What a master piece. The most powerful spiritual lesson to be learnt is right here :)  Prem/Love is living yoga. The world has been misled due to the extreme level of maya in these ends times of ghor kaliyuga that external approval is part of love when it is actually just escapism.  Love starts with trusting the self. Respecting the self. It is not allowing anyone to play you like a toy or an object to be objectified. A lot of women suffer by default when they allow the man to mislead her or harm her feminity. There is nothing wrong with clubbing drinking dating or partying. The point is are you with the one within through it all ? Are you really meditating on what the atman within you is instructing you every moment ? If you can keep tuning into the inner guardian the atman the light within , then you can truly live mukti because you will never go wrong. That is the only way to be liberated. This is your only responsibility.  The inner self is shiv shakti within, the inner parent will always be your best friend. It will safeguard you everytime. Never do anything against it\u0027s instruction.  Pls treasure yourself because you are a precious divine queen to be who only deserves the very  best that life has to offer. Learn from her. Raye is singing the truth of the pain she feels because of abandoning herself. She has poured her heart, mind, soul out. This song is sacred. The self the light , the atman within is our only true guardian. Pls only follow it\u0027s instruction and don\u0027t let the flesh mislead you into the illusion 🕉🙏🏼 Love from Bharat India  Namaste  🩷🙏🏼🇮🇳",

  "Why is the western culture so demonic an evil? Why do you guys glorify all this junk? If you know anything about the fallen angels, Satan was a musician and heaven, that was his skill. After trying to betray God, and turning against him, he was kicked out of heaven, and took 1/3 of the angels and fell from the skies. God gave him free reign over the earth, and created man to make his own decisions and free will. One day I came home and said Jesus, if you are really real like they say you are please reveal yourself to me or show me a clear sign so I know you are real. I am a person who does not believe in things I do not see, nor do I believe in things like luck, superstition , or miracles. Immediately the energy in the room changed and I felt this heavy conviction in my heart so I started to just repent and ask for forgiveness of my past sins. I was drenched in tears, and I have no idea why because I normally do not cry. I noticed the more genuine and sincere I was when asking for forgiveness of my sins, the stronger the connection became with the energy. After the session that was incredibly supernatural and intense, I go outside to get some fresh air, and I see this bright, intense light in the form of a cross, looking directly at me. I was in complete shock at what I was witnessing because I have never experienced anything, super natural or miraculous in my life before. I was completely petrified, but it was a peaceful moment. There was so much love, mercy, and grace, radiating out of that light that I cannot put into words, other than describing it like that. The very next day, everything in my life completely changed. The music that I listen to the movies and videos that I watched even the jokes that I used to laugh at all, became petty and nonsensical out of nowhere. I’ve tried every single counseling, treatment, center and alternative medicine, but nothing would put a dent into my 15 year addiction to alcohol which later evolve to opiates . I was also dealing with five years of intense, suicidal depression, but it all dissolved overnight. How could that be? I then became obsessed with pursuing and seeking God with all of my body, mind and soul. It really is a God and his name is king Jesus, and there really is a devil and his name is Satan. Satan’s entire job is to make sure you are deceived every step of the way throughout your whole life on knowing who this Jesus is. He has the ability with his minions to hijack your voice when you think, making you believe it’s your own thoughts and ramble in your head but you are being deceived. If you do not have the protection of God, you are constantly be deceived. All of this will make sense when you break through as well. I have no benefit in getting money, subscribers, attention, etc.. How can I get that for my YouTube comment?  I absolutely urge you to experience this for yourself because if you’re like me, testimonials are one ear out the other, and that’s how it used to be for me, mocking and ridiculing people that were into the stuff. You will notice how evil this world really is all of the clothes in the signs will start to pop out at you. It starts, but you going into the quietness and privacy of your room tonight and ask for forgiveness of your past sins, the only strip to making sure this works is to repent of your past sins in the most genuine and sincere way that will unlock and breakthrough. Good luck tonight and God bless you.",

He’s always knocking at you door but we sometimes have the music too loud to ever hear him outside.

The debate isn\u0027t only about him, but about all who sing about violence. Why? Because they believe that their rapping normalizes violence.  If they are right - doesn\u0027t this song do the same thing? It normalizes alcohol and drug abuse as a coping mechanism for heartbreak. Such behaviour is understandable - but nevertheless not ideal and not something that should be encouraged and normalized.",

  "At 3:37 we can see that the nails on her face at 1:07 were these three blonde girls’ nails And then the scenes after she swallows that candy show her completely intoxicated At 1:34 the reflection in the mirror that she sees is her totally in control, outgoing self, but in reality she’s tripping over herself, faded out of her mind Her “new man” isn’t even looking at her, he’s like a prop. In the scenes without the 3 girls, she is always alone. They represent her intoxication, the thing that she uses to stop feeling alone.  The song has two layers, on the outside it’s supposed to be a celebratory villain era “hey look im over him” song, but inside it shows how terribly our modern consumerist society deals with pain, and the music video does a beautifully artistic job of showing how this kind of behaviour is ultimately destructive and pushes the people who actually care about you away. Amazing direction holy shit this is really perfect",

  "I love how this song delves into such ubiquitous and important yet overlooked aspects of human psychology and behavior! In this song, the narrator is faced with a stressor, but clearly makes poor choices and does not effectively cope with their situation despite desperately wanting to escape, as the title of the song suggests, from the stressor and the immense negative emotions it induces. And the narrator is not alone; countless people get caught up in the vicious cycle of repeatedly making poor choices for the sake of taking the easy way out and getting into a state of euphoria, albeit temporarily. Thus, I actually think this song can serve as a great launching point for discussions about wellness and stress management techniques. Specifically, it has raised questions for me on how the narrator could have more effectively dealt with their situation in a manner that\u0027s conducive to their well-being. And I\u0027m sure the answers to these questions, though varying from person to person, would have a surprising level of applicability for people across the globe looking to escape, whether physically or mentally, from all sorts of stressors but not knowing how to effectively do so. It\u0027s a common trope among humanity that needs to be looked into and addressed!",

  "A way to get rid of the pain is by trusting God, the Lord. Your life will completely change when « you believe ».  Tragic experiences happen, but the Lord will give you strength to get up and be truly happy. I talk from experiences. I was sad and lived a fake life, did things that I’m ashamed to say…, but one day I found myself alone. I felt like the world was against. My Life was full of problems. The only thing I said was sorry God ( and it was genuine). The moment my so called friends abandoned me, he was there for me. God being amazing he changed my life  for the Better. It took some time because God has a different and perfect timing.However, one thing is sure, although I still sin, each time I do, I deeply regret it, I feel better. My life has truly changed and then I feel better mentally and physically.",

  "Reminds me of where a lot of my old highschool friends are currently in life. They do drugs, sleep around, and have fun in the moment. Then they wonder why they can never find anyone trustworthy to date, or they are depressed and in that expensive college debt just tryna figure out life. Happy I didn’t go down the route. I knew I would never be able to sleep around due to my morals so I dated for marriage and started a family instead. I’m lucky my husband has the same beliefs as me and recognized that the average 20 year old behavior is just toxic to themselves instead of this labeled “ freedom “. That “ freedom “ to sleep around and do drugs leaves you feeling icky, insecure, and depressed eventually.",

Outside you might be doing all these things like going out and living a fast paced life but inside it\u0027s all screaming and slow-mo as you play the same thoughts again and again. And lev of emotional involvement in singing the slow parts is incredible. I think without these lyrical parts song would have been just an average rap song.

Then the upbeat music starts at 3:55 depicting how the headache becomes a constant bg music while she tells us what it feels like to have experienced it all. This song is ART .

Reduce the number of things your have and live in silence for a while and then get back to what you were doing then you’ll realize that person addiction thing was nothing.

  "\"Addiction is a subject I talk about a lot in the album – especially on the “Escapism”. As a woman, I felt like I couldn’t talk about that. The industry makes us understand that it’s not sexy. But silence does not help, on the contrary. For years, I kept this part of me a secret. I consumed products to endure the absurdity of my life, the lie that my career had become. It was very dark. Since I left this system, I am much healthier because the only pressure I have to bear is the one I put on myself.\" -Raye",
  "\"“Escapism” is about running away from reality as fast as you possibly can. Going out alone, ignoring everybody who has your best interest at heart. Chasing a maze of smoke and mirrors because clarity is bitterly intimidating. When you’re your lowest of lows, it’s like survival mode mind numbing, running from real life because it’s not something you want to see. Sonically large and dramatic, something to accompany this feeling, to get lost to and maybe you might find some healing inside of it like I did.\" -Raye",
  "\"Escapism as a topic, it’s something I feel like a lot of people relate to when you’re going through hardships in life. You’ll just do anything to run away from that feeling. Then you have to go to work and smile and pretend everything’s okay, but it’s not. I think especially as a woman, we must always have this brave face, smile, be polite, don’t be difficult, you know. But meanwhile, you’re dealing with dark things, and you have to just get on with it. I was lightly in love. What’s that word? It’s like, I know I’m not gonna be with you forever, but part of an escapist feeling. Sadly, it’s not always good for you. I had someone with me 24 hours a day. I was never alone. I was unable to be alone because I was scared to process my own thoughts. When that ended – and on top of all the trauma and things that I was dealing with – I absolutely spiraled.\" -Raye",

  "(Before anything,  I\u0027m not a bot. Just someone spreading the Gospel. I condense the message with key points and do copy and paste, but understand that I do care for anyone coming across this) We all need saving and the only One who can save us is Jesus Christ! We are desperately sick, with the sickness of sin. We have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, and we need a Savior (Romans 3:23). THE Savior, who is Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Only through Him we can be reconciled to God and be saved (John 14:6). Please turn to Him today, and turn away from sin. He provides something much better than the mere fleeting pleasures of this world could ever bring (1 John 2). In Him we have peace that surpasses all understanding, true rest, vindication, a friend, sanctification, and most of all- Salvation and an eternal hope. If you live for Christ you will have no regrets. (John 14:27, Matthew 11:28, Proverbs 18:24, 1 Corinthians 1:30, 21 and 22) and you will be serving the True Living God who loved us so much and gave His precious Son for us ^^ Jesus is coming back soon! Get right with Him and flee the wrath to come! John 3:16-18: For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the Name of God’s one and only Son. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4: Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance : that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve...\" 2 Corinthians 5:20-21: Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making His appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake He made Him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.",

Proszę cokolwiek Doktorze doktorze! Zmiłuj się nade mną Zabierz ten ból Pytasz się o moje symptomy, doktorze, ja nie chce czuć Wziął tego jointa, jak dmucham w parę Wrócę do starych zwyczajów z 2019 Nie minęły dwadzieścia cztery godziny, odkąd mój były go zabił Mam nowego facet przy sobie, zrobi się potliwie Zeszła noc była jak wisienka na torcie Ostatnie dni były ciemne co uważam za paraliżujące Wybaczcie mój stan Jestem tak zjarana jak twoje wymagania Które zrobisz na moim łóżku Rozgrzejesz mnie aż zaskwierczę Gdy cofnę się krok w tył by zobaczyć szklankę w połowie pełną Przynajmniej mam Prade dwu częściową w której szaleje I już zachowuje się jak dupek Wiesz o co chodzi? Wiec jak chcesz możesz się tego trzymać Suko, tylko serce złamane Wysokie szpilki, sześć cali Na tyłach klubu popijając szampan Nie ufam żadnym z tych suk Z tyłu taksówki wciągając kokainę Pijane rozmowy Pijane pisanie Pijane łzy Pijany seks Szukałam mężczyznę z tej samej strony Teraz wracamy do intra, wracamy do baru, do Bentleya, do hotelu, do tych starych zwyczajów Bo nie chce czuć, tego co wieczorem Nie chce czuć, tego co wieczorem Doktorze, doktorze! Proszę cokolwiek Doktorze doktorze! Zmiłuj się nade mną Zabierz ten ból Pytasz się o moje symptomy, doktorze, ja nie chce czuć Bo nie chce czuć, tego co wieczorem Nie chce czuć, tego co wieczorem Pogódź się z rzeczami, których nie możesz zmienić Będę nagi, gdy odejdę i byłem nagi, gdy przyszedłem Poza zasięgiem, poza dotykiem, zbyt odrętwiały, nie czuję się w żadnego sposobu Wznieśmy toast, więc co, ulica mała, ale działa w dwie strony Więc będziesz uciekał, ale nigdy nie uciekniesz. Zachód słońca w labiryncie Pytasz się o moje symptomy, doktorze, ja nie chce czuć Bo nie chce czuć, tego co wieczorem Nie chce czuć, tego co wieczorem Doktorze, doktorze! Proszę cokolwiek Doktorze doktorze! Zmiłuj się nade mną Zabierz ten ból Pytasz się o moje symptomy, doktorze, ja nie chce czuć Nie chce czuć, tego co wieczorem Nie chce czuć, tego co wieczorem Nie chce czuć, tego co wieczorem Szminka rozmazana jak sztuka współczesna Nie wiem gdzie kurwa jestem i kto prowadzi jebany samochód Przyspieszając, popijając autostradę Mieszam pigułki z alkoholem Bo pierdole te uczucia Nie odpisuje wszystkim których kocham Wyrzucam tajemnice do nieznajomego w moim łóżku Nic nie pamiętam wiec niczego nie żałuję",

  "A Metallers reaction: I like the surreal sounding intro, but in 10 seconds, the musical build up is spoilt, straight in with an overpowered beat. After 20 seconds, the track mellows a little with ethereal keyboards in the background. Even though the mundane beat is over powering, the musical element does start to build up more. The vocals are very catchy, blending well in key. There are some intriguing musical changes relating to story telling which makes it clear on the video. The only criticism of the track is to tone down the beat. I would rate 7/10.",

I\u0027m not even into that \"genre\" of music, if I can even define Raye\u0027s music (but I can\u0027t really), and wasn\u0027t looking for this or knew Raye before those last 4 singles she released.

  "Raye I’m a bit of a lover of almost every genre of music (I know everyone loved music and I’m not unique but it’s what I live for is my point) as a bit of an obsessed searcher of that special something that only certain songs ever achieve despite there being many many amazing, all time great songs, but I know it’s different for different people. Even as a song writer, singer/musician of alternative music and mixed genre mostly with the language to explain a lot of what makes songs great, I’m always struggling to fully explain what makes something just so special to people when it goes beyond explanation in that magical way. Always trying to have people picture exactly how a song and it’s moments would go with a music video or movie moment we are creating in our brains and stuff too. BUT I say all this only to tell you how much of a big deal it is for me to say that since I heard this song maybe two weeks ago, it isn’t just my favourite song and having a FAVOURITE song above all other is impossible enough for me because of my love for so many different sounds, but this is my ALL TIME FAVOURITE song I’ve ever heard in my life and I can say that confidently. It is special and emotional and layered and smart and just SO MANY WORDS all at once; and then it goes beyond what words can say. I know there’s some music wanks that might tell me that’s wrong because there’s songs like American pie which is also a favourite and think on the surface this song is a dance song, but it’s so much more than that and I wouldn’t even call it that. I almost want to call it the perfect sad party song but even that is not a good enough way to describe it because it’s just so many things at once. So complex emotionally and musically and lyrically even… just wow my words aren’t good enough. It’s truly a masterpiece.",
