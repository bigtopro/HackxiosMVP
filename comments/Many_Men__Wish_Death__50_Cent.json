  "In the biblical story of Daniel, a group of officials tricked King Darius into making a law that prohibited praying to any god other than the king for thirty days. This was a scheme to trap Daniel, who was known for his faithfulness to God and his habit of praying three times a day. Daniel, upon learning of the law, continued his practice of prayer, leading to his arrest and imprisonment in a den of lions. However, God intervened, protecting Daniel from the lions, and the plotters were ultimately punished.  Here\u0027s a more detailed breakdown: The Setup: Jealous officials, seeking to undermine Daniel\u0027s position, realized they could exploit his unwavering faith.  The Law: They convinced King Darius to decree that anyone praying to any god other than him would be thrown into a lions\u0027 den.  Daniel\u0027s Faithfulness: Daniel continued his regular prayers to God, knowing the consequences.  The Trap: The officials reported Daniel\u0027s actions to the king, forcing him to enforce the law.  Divine Intervention: God protected Daniel in the lions\u0027 den, sending an angel to shut the lions\u0027 mouths.  The Consequence: The officials and their families were thrown into the lions\u0027 den, where they were immediately devoured. King Daniel",

Ah, son, pull off, pull off [Intro: 50 Cent] Many men wish death upon me Blood in my eye, dog, and I can\u0027t see I\u0027m trying to be what I\u0027m destined to be And niggas trying to take my life away (Come on) I put a hole in a nigga for fucking with me My back on the wall, now you gon\u0027 see Better watch how you talk when you talk about me Cause I\u0027ll come and take your life away [Chorus: 50 Cent] Many men Many, many, many, many men Wish death \u0027pon me Lord, I don\u0027t cry no more Don\u0027t look to the sky no more Have mercy on me [Verse 1: 50 Cent] Now man, these pussy niggas putting money on my head Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain\u0027t dead I\u0027m the diamond in the dirt that ain\u0027t been found I\u0027m the underground king and I ain\u0027t been crowned When I rhyme, something special happened every time I\u0027m the greatest, something like Ali in his prime I walk the block with the bundles, I\u0027ve been knocked on the humble Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do Got a temper, nigga, go \u0027head, lose your head Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs I walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain\u0027t over [Chorus: 50 Cent] Many men Many, many, many, many men Wish death \u0027pon me Lord, I don\u0027t cry no more Don\u0027t look to the sky no more Have mercy on me Have mercy on my soul Somewhere my heart turned cold Have mercy on many men Many, many, many, many men Wish death \u0027pon me [Verse 2: 50 Cent] Sunny days wouldn\u0027t be special if it wasn\u0027t for rain Joy wouldn\u0027t feel so good if it wasn\u0027t for pain Death gotta be easy, cause life is hard It\u0027ll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred This is for my niggas on the block twisting trees in cigars For the niggas on lock doing life behind bars I don\u0027t say, \"Only God can judge me,\" cause I see things clear Crooked-ass crackers will give my Black ass a hundred years I\u0027m like Paulie in GoodFellas, you can call me the Don Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie?

You can\u0027t read between the lines? In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around Hommo shot me, three weeks later he got shot down Now it\u0027s clear that I\u0027m here for a real reason Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain\u0027t fucking breathing [Chorus: 50 Cent] Many men Many, many, many, many men Wish death \u0027pon me Lord, I don\u0027t cry no more Don\u0027t look to the sky no more Have mercy on me Have mercy on my soul Somewhere my heart turned cold Have mercy on many men Many, many, many, many men Wish death \u0027pon me",

  "This is when I loved Eminem, until he gave in to the establishment, I loved him. But I can not support someone who bows to the establishment. Out of all the people he hated , the one who lost billions of dollars and made no money going into office. While all others made millions going into office. I thought Eminem was from the struggle and wanted someone to put their money where their mouth is. Trump did that and still he hated him instead of the people who he supported, who scam the struggling people of your country. I’m from the homeless, the refuge , the street the hell you want to call it. When Trump did what he did, I applauded, that some rich guy was going to put his money where his mouth is. Trump stops wars, killing and what you’re all against that. When he stops wars, my country men don’t have to die, do you think of other people or just yourselves. Stuff your rap if you can’t be a humane person and stop killing. You need borders, and stupid moron who believes they live in a utopian world is delusional. People love to help people, but if it’s to shit on your own civilians, you’re a traitor to your country. It’s like being at home with your family , good people knock and say hello and ask for permission. What do bad people do. If you’re too dumb to figure it out, it’s on you. Eminem goes of on people who attack him and his family, what’s the difference when it’s to protect your country. There is no difference. Wake up .",
  "Dumbo. Trump supportin Russia, who invaded a country and killed their people after breaking previous ceasefires and taking land. Protect your country, you\u0027re gonna be the one suffering if Putin gets more power, or you didn\u0027t learn from WW2. Follow the billionaire who helps his friends and talks down to the guy protecting his people. Dw Russia will get the resources and then see who has \u0027the cards\u0027. If it was as easy as stopping killing you don\u0027t think he would do that, when someone steals from you twice do you trust them the third time.

  "Hey guys ,I want to tell you something ,I just found out after a long investigation from I was a kid I just found out something , many of the artist you know especially the ones in iluminati is actually working for the government ,and in ways you would not believe , moastly they are snitches ,they get to do their own dirty buisness if they rat out other criminals ,they may have contact with big cartels to ,then they tell the police where to find drugs and stuff ,so they can keep an cartel or criminals from ever get as big as for instance , Pablo Escobar,and yes Pablo may went a bit over the line but yet still he served the people ,but the government manufactured him the worst way possible, of course the power went over his head but there are many other ( criminals) out there fighting for our rights , but artist like Eminem,Dr Dre, whiz, Rihanna, snoop dog, lil Wayne,drake ,50 cent , vybz cartell and  all people under him , and so many more artist and well known actors and so on really working with the police , and it\u0027s so many other things you do not know ,there is a cure for cancer ,but the government do not won\u0027t it to exist a cure for cancer or viruses,the whole thing is death they want to controll everything and make Shure there is only rich people getting these things so they can make a thon of money ,not any government in any country in the world is really for the people ,belive me! Fight the system with me speak up for yourself and your rights ,and do it now people! , and the ting with vybz cartell being in jail is just for the show for people to believe he is not with them ! Believe me!  And people like trump are like this to they are just muppets being controlled by people in the background and people been trying to kill me many times over for telling but I\u0027m not giving a shit,after so many guns klicked and not going of when people try to shot me I\u0027m living proof of a chosen one .",

  "​​@@User02741Mass deportations of illegals, people that aren\u0027t allowed to be there being sent back, they haven\u0027t had their information or possible criminal background checked. It is like someone with a restraining order going to their exes house to rest, he can\u0027t be there no matter what. There\u0027s 8 - 11 mil illegals in your country, they all have to be fed and housed somewhere, which also help drive up the housing crisis and increases your taxes. They often are exploited by companies cause they will work for less than minimum wage, since it still is more than back home, which drives wages down for the rest of the actual citizens, they also don\u0027t pay taxes cause they can\u0027t have an official job. Have you seen in new york where they build anti homeless benches, yet migrants were allowed to be housed in one of new yorks schools? He\u0027s not supported just cause he got shot aldough it does help him look like a martyr. And i wanna know what lies about hatian migrants? Please cite sources for the previous statements of him wanting to suspend the constitution or \"unalive\" people that don\u0027t support him. An also what has kamala done that makes her a better choice over trump? I don\u0027t understand how not letting illegals in your country or putting your own citizens over foreigners is a contriversial thing in your country.",

  "Brother, I told myself I would not come bug you anymore but I\u0027m afraid as of this morning I have an issue that I can not dismiss. I have endured a lot for your buddy. You have to admit I have. It\u0027d run it\u0027s course \u0026 I\u0027m already burnt out on the lack of physical intent but it was something I have only today seen that has my stomach heaving to vomit. For Real. I never seen before the tattoo on his abdomen pelvic area. Brother, unless he steps up \u0026 speaks to me about it, it has the waterfall effect inside me when I see it of the closest feeling I\u0027ve ever had. After 2 q/2 yrs not knowing \u0026 then having to stumble upon it (I told you I do not research others lives) I am, you know, I don\u0027t even have a word. I ain\u0027t like that brother. I think I\u0027ve explained. I can\u0027t with a females name in my face like that. He don\u0027t want to listen but it switched gears inside me that is completely different that I can\u0027t describe that either. I deserved to have been told. I am transparent. I have no surprises. This, this one, add his refusal to be real, just changed everything. He don\u0027t listen brother but this one, he needs to. I\u0027m explaining because he is always so confident in his thinking which is quite difficult enough but this issue, I wanted to throw up \u0026 I froze inside. This one he needs to step up \u0026 talk. I\u0027m already in a bad position from his mythology \u0026 lack of ability to step forward but this pulled up the gate so there is no crossing the moat. I\u0027m leaving my words for you to understand. I hope you do. P aka Xpektus He should have asked me if it was something that I could deal with. He didn\u0027t. I cant",

  "VER IMPORTANT FOR THE HUMANITY!!PLEASE READ!!There is a special technology of conspirators. They can track a person from a distance via a satellite with an infrared camera and use the radiation at the right moment to cause the person to stumble on stairs, cause a blackout when thinking, or cause the extreme blinking and eye twitching that are familiar from Hollywood films, which have no known cause in medicine. You can use it to cause constipation, erection problems, headaches, upturned nose, runny nose, the suffocating feeling in the chest, the suffocating feeling in the head and much more. They can speak in the room where the person being tracked is in so that they can be heard in the room, they can speak in such a way that you only perceive them in your head as your own mental voice, and they can speak as I speak so that my throat speaks his words. They engage one family per person tracked. You already know substances that preserve the human body so that the cells do not age, and substances that put the body on standby so that only the brain and the heart have to work regularly and therefore little energy, no sleep and no food or drink is necessary. That is why they can commission a family from birth to death for an ordinary citizen. In addition, they have managed to digitize people\u0027s eyes, ears and brains and access this data remotely, i.e. h. the visual images, the mental text voice, what you hear with your ears and what you see with your eyes. Through mental power they can show themselves in the citizen\u0027s mind as the person they are, they can also show themselves in our minds as another person or something else, through an artificial intelligence that can control this dedicated family using voice recognition. Believe it or not, they can even transfer any thought or feeling they want to the persecuted citizen in such a way that they understand it the same way. I know all this because the men and women from the dedicated family that is pursuing me developed a jealousy problem with each other during their task because of my marsturbation, which led to arguments and insanity among them, which led to the men making extra mistakes, extra revealed everything and wanted to destroy my life since their problem 7 years ago and destroyed it. 70% of the time they give me the suffocating feeling in the chest, the suffocating feeling in the head and bad thought-feeling transferences.",

You are the GOAT.❤🎉😅👍🏽🔥🔥🎄🎄🎁🎊😁 According to recent reports, 50 Cent has publicly stated that he is currently \"practicing abstinence\" and is not having sex, essentially claiming that he has not engaged in sexual activity for the year 2024; while he hasn\u0027t explicitly said he hasn\u0027t had sex in 10 years, his recent comments focus on his current commitment to celibacy.  Key points about 50 Cent\u0027s stance on sex: Public declaration: He shared on social media that he is \"practicing abstinence\" in 2024, indicating he is choosing to abstain from sexual activity.  Reasoning: 50 Cent has stated that he believes abstaining from sex helps him focus on his goals and business ventures.  Potential for interpretation: Some may interpret this as a claim that he has been celibate for a longer period, but the most recent information points to his current commitment to abstinence in 2024.",

A guy from Hawaii named Ryan Routh was hiding in the bushes near the 6th hole of The Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach Florida with an AK-47 with a scope, 2 backpacks, and a go pro. He hid there for about 12 hours. Apparently the area he hid in is where paparazzi usually go to get good video of Trump playing. But there was a secret service agent that was a hole ahead of the president that spotted the gun barrel pointing out of the fence and fired at Routh. Routh fled and got in his black SUV. Luckily there was an amazing eye witness who spotted him and got his license plate. To where the WPBPD got him and arrested him. Although, they\u0027re not taking him to the FBI as they don\u0027t want him to be \"Jack Ruby\u0027d\"",

  "for USA and Israel:  Our Father Lord God, the Holy King, Holy Mighty God Who art in heaven,  Hallowed be Thy Name.  Thy Kingdom come.  Thy Will be done,  on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread.  And forgive us our trespasses,  as we forgive those who trespass against us.  And lead us not into temptation,  but deliver us from evil. Amen. Hail Mary,  Full of Holy Grace,  The Lord God is with thee.  Blessed art thou among women,  and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, the Lord Jesus Christ.  Holy Mary, Mother of Lord God, pray for us sinners, spread the effect of grace of Thy Flame of Holy Love over all of humanity, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Honor and Glory be to the Holy Father, and to the Holy Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. Holy Angels of Lord God, the Holy King my guardian dear,  To whom Holy Lord God\u0027s holy love commits me here,  Ever this day,  be at my side,  To light and guard,  Rule and guide. Amen. St. Michael the Archangel, pray for us. Defend us in battle.  Be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the Devil.  May Holy Lord God, the Holy King rebuke him, we humbly pray,  and do thou,  O Holy Prince of the heavenly hosts,  by the power of Holy Lord God, the Holy King thrust into hell Satan,  and all the evil spirits,  who prowl about the world  seeking the ruin of souls. Amen. . O glorious prince St. Michael, the Archangel,  chief and commander of the heavenly hosts,  guardian of souls, vanquisher of rebel spirits,  servant in the house of the Divine King and our admirable conductor,  you who shine with excellence and superhuman virtue deliver us from all evil, who turn to you with confidence and enable us by your gracious protection to serve the Holy Lord God, the Holy King more and more faithfully every day. Amen. Act of Contrition O my Lord God, the Holy King I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee,  and I detest all my sins,  because I dread the loss of heaven, and the pains of hell;  but most of all because they offend Thee, my Lord God, the Holy King Who are all good and deserving of all my holy love.  I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy holy grace,  to confess my sins, to do penance,  and to amend my life. Our Holy Lord and Savior Jesus Christ suffered and die for us in his name my Lord God, the Holy King have mercy. Amen. I believe in the Lord God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth;  and in the Lord Jesus Christ, His only Holy Son Our Holy Lord God,  Who was conceived by the Holy Lord God, the Holy Spirit, born of the Holy Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.  He descended into Hell; the third day He rose again from the dead;  He ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Lord God, the Father almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.  I believe in the Holy Lord God, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the Holy Communion of Holy Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and life everlasting.  Amen.",

I relate this song to President Trump because he is against these EVIL doers Trying to take him out. Your British NO Doubt with That Old Chap.

  "the truth is 5 words. knowledge is better than leadership .i am in a mental hospital for illegal threats 12 years ago and i am greek but live in sweden, so i have been her e12 years in different mental hospitals, i was without medication before a long time and then they gave it to me again, unfortunaly its not a choise they force u to take it, last month the doctor took it oway again after i wrote to her about mental health,medicin, and reality, she understood allot of what i wrote i think and she said its fine to have intrests, i wright allot, but i always throw it oway, i dont want anybody to read it and missjudge me, now i am going to explain some things i want u to read very carefuly, take ure time, dont stress to read , slow down and analyze every word, ok here we go, religion is different storys, with god or gods in it, the person or thing called god was invented because people could not explain existence, the universe, the heaven actualy, the stars the sun, many things has been worshiped, something that can not be proven is called fantasi or imagination, so it is the same things as thoughts without proof, there is information and dissinfomation, diss information is what is not proven, just a theory or a story or whatever u want to call it, like santa claus at christmas,or like the toothfairy that we say to children, children can solve that out, most of them, they realize sometime we lied to them because we thought it would be nice, or funny for them to be excited about something, its not that big of a deal but still, we lied, we thought them the art of lying, anyway, later they learn about religion,some people talk to them about ghost,demons,the devil, in islam its jins, and the kids fear them, they can even fear god sometimes, why do we give them something to fear? society dont know how to help them when they are sad, scared, poor, abused and get realy bad mental health, they put them in psychiatry clinics, mental hospitals, jail ....u see, you understand what i am wrighting about, how often do we talk to children about money? we do but we dont say it is things that they get from it, nothing alse, money is things and food , we dont say that they should only get so much things they need, infact we show them to have too much when others have nothing, education for children should be uppgrated,changed, it is 2024 it is time, maybe we are too late, i hope not, my issue is now should i talk to my doctor about medicin because i dont think it help people, because the mind can not be medicinated, it is changed by knowledge, information, information is the things i wrote about, it is not something always that can be shown pfysical but it can be show in the mind, the brain, if u understand, if u can see what i am trying to show you, its like a picture, the more details you have of my picture the more you can see it, my reality, becuae reality is different from person to person, ask youre friends, what is reality, ask other people because youre friends might have similar answers to you, but do other people? google it, reality, it says everything in existence, everything is a stupid word, the language we have is old, many words dont have meaning, so there is existence, that we know of, many years ago they did not have microscope so they did not see bacteria, it does not mean it did not exist, so oure global reality changes with the new things we know,, so as i was saying about medicin, when you feel bad its always good to sleep so some medicin is good if it makes you slepp, we need sleep so that we do not hallucinate, also i dont know if the brain can be damaged without sleep, maybe, i dont know everything, diagnosis, like scizofrenia and depression and others, do they exist? if yes then why is not stupidity a diagnosis, or a deasese, a mental illness? you ca nnot put name to anything, the mind is to complicated, i can use cannabis infact i did last month and the doctor didnt like it but i was ok and she still took away my medicin and no i would not like to try peyote i am smart already, and cannabis is psychedelique to they say but i dont notice it, and how do you get new information from hallucinate, you dont, it just help u think maybe, but you can only think of what u know of, i smoked 12 years ago too and i dont know if that was why i started suspecting, and it may ended me up in mental hospital but it ended me up with allot of information like jacque freco has and also dissinformation like conspiracy theories witch is not proven therefore they called conspiracy, noone is mentaly safe when they grow up with garbage and are pressed in life and also have drug addictions, they usualy cant find quality or efford it and quantity, then they cant sleep,eat,have nightmares, the weather outside in sweden is shit, all my friends are conciderd criminals, and yes they are after money...if thats a criminal, life is a risk, in this thing we made for ourselfes its a big risk you dont only have to survive birth you gotta deal with all the bullshit too, what i understand is that the media is bought or is used for financial gain and entertainment, they dont talk about why we need entertainment in times like thesse and they show casinos where people bet their money, its a big industry the betting sites are getting bigger, and the addiction worse, television is garbage, when they show information its national geografic, animal planet lions killing hyenas and zebras, or its about the second world war and hitler, i know this sence i was a kid why they keep showing it? why dont they just expose everything? well because thats oure job i hope you use this information for the better of human kind and the earth, thank you for reading and i wish you the best, even better! :)",
