  "This song reminds me of my friend. Everything that he sings in this song just fits my feelings for her perfectly. It brings back the memories of the dark times in my life, when my best friend never left my side. It reminds me of the first time we hung out outside of college, the winter, the walk, the street, the sweets and coffee we shared, and the subway ride back home without her. This reminds me of everytime we hung out in college cafeteria. Reminds me of the time she came over to my place and we baked a cake and watched our favorite show. The happiness that I feel around her is so genuine that I love every second of her company and when we part my heart aches.  I\u0027m too shy to send her this song and tell her that this song, to me, is about her. Maybe one day.",

Then I can vote and do my best to stop nonsense like this”.  My wonderful grandfather, 86 at the time, shook his head and said “No no, buddy, don’t wish your life away like that”. At the time I didn’t really understand what he meant. I was so eager to grow up that I couldn’t understand why anyone would want to be as young as I was.  I’m 29 now, and I understand. To all the beautiful souls listening to this song, know this: time and life are both precious gifts. Don’t waste them by rushing around, or by being lazy.

Word to the wise - don’t do anything on your back (tattoo wise) unless you have a high pain threshold were a few times I nearly said stop and leave it half done and the guy that did it was great bloke but Italian and he put one word in wrong place I think she said it was or when should have been and something like that, she didn’t notice for about 6 months and at the end of the day I’m the only one now who knows it’s there no one’s sees it so what the heck. I love this song, I love this man and most of his music I’m 68 now and most afternoons if I’m at home I try to play vinyl for a few hours his 1970’s Greatest Hits ‘Photographs \u0026 Memories’ often gets a play.

There was a picture with him and his girlfriend, the time we ran into the coach at a carnival on the back wrote \"There never seems to be enough time to do the things that you want to do once you find them\". Handed the picture to his girlfriend. She read the words to our coach who said \"those are lyrics to an old song\". After the game (we won) the girlfriend came around. After the post game festivities walking to our cars and someone is playing this on the guitar. Someone stopped and said. This is the song. She said its a sign that he\u0027s calling out to us.

  "I remember this song like it came out yesterday. I listen to it now and it makes me cry. My wife and I got into a heated argument things were said. So I wrote down the lyrics on stationary and dropped it into a bottle to give to her. Her name was Heidi. I never got to give it to Heidi. Long story short my Heidi passed away from some unforseen illness. The bottle with the lyrics sits on my dresser to this day. I never really got around to telling her how much she meant to me and how she saved my life. I hope she knows that I really do love her still and miss her everyday. If you have someone in your life that you love and care about tell them before you lose that chance. Life is short tomorrow isn\u0027t promised to anyone. Don\u0027t wind up like me thinking of all the things I should have said to my wife Heidi but never did. You will hate yourself like I hate myself.

  "I just saw AJ Croce in concert tonight in Shipshewana IN with my son. We are both big fans of Jim Croce.  AJ is a fine musician, and we enjoyed his concert very much and his own music. I got chills when he sang \"Operator\" and had tears in my eyes. When I got married in April 1974, my husband and I had chosen Jim Croce\u0027s song \"Time In A Bottle\" for our 1st dance at our reception. I was hoping to hear AJ sing it tonight along with \"I\u0027ll Have To Tell You I Love You In A Song\" but he didn\u0027t sing those two favorites of mine but at least I got to hear Operator and a few of Jim\u0027s other hits. It was still a great night for me.    AJ, has a new album out now and I wish him all the best success with it and for his career. My son and I really enjoyed AJ\u0027s concert tonight and if anyone hasn\u0027t seen AJ perform yet I encourage you to do so. He\u0027s very entertaining and I loved his stories between songs. He was great and I liked his music and will have to look for his latest album. His father must be beaming with pride when he see\u0027s his son tell stories and sing tribute to him looking down from Heaven.  ♥♥",

Granted he was from a different era, he passed in 1973, before I was born, and it was due to a plane crash, not natural causes. Even then, he shouldn’t have even thought himself close to death but he wrote this song. For one, the song is deep for someone who should have been in the prime of their life.  The fact that he wrote this shows how insightful he was, death or things starting to be more difficult as it does when we get older as I know, I’m appreciating 50 and have developed pains I have got frustrated about my parents having, he shouldn’t have had any idea about this but he did, and he shared it to everyone in song. The saddest thing about Jim Croce is most of his success came after his untimely death.  He was sooooo good but not truly appreciated until after his death. What an impression he made on the world.  I sure wish he would have been able to see it for himself.",

Here we have a tribute to a great singer/songwriter that died (in real life, no less), tragically, very young and way to soon, and his song that became, perhaps, the most popular wedding song of all time. And 95% (or more) of the comments are about the fictional death of a Marvel Comics CHARACTER?!? My brother and his bride of 50 years had this song at their wedding in 1974. Thousands of newlywed couples started their life TOGETHER with this song!!! I know of couples using this song in their weddings to this day.",

We spoke every day for years, but he went silent for this ordeal. I respected his silence. Put one card in his mailbox. His wife said he liked it. Sent one text about pilots(we were flyers). He acknowledged the text.  Some would call him stubborn, but he was a man of his convictions.  God made him, God can heal him or take him home. He never faltered.",

  "Текст песни If I could save time in a bottle, Если бы я мог сэкономить время в бутылке, The first thing that I\u0027d like to do Первое, что я хотел бы сделать Is to save everyday till eternity passes away Заключается в том, чтобы экономить каждый день, пока не пройдет вечность Just to spend them with you. Просто чтобы провести их с тобой. If I could make days last forever, Если бы я мог сделать так, чтобы дни длились вечно, If words could make wishes come true, Если бы слова могли воплощать желания в реальность, I\u0027d save everyday like a treasure and then, Я бы копил каждый день, как сокровище, а потом, Again, I would spend them with you. Опять же, я бы провел их с тобой. But there never seems to be enough time Но, кажется, времени никогда не хватает To do the things you wanna do Делать то, что ты хочешь делать Once you find them. Как только ты их найдешь. I\u0027ve looked around enough to know that Я достаточно огляделся, чтобы понять это You\u0027re the one I wanna go through time with Ты единственный, с кем я хочу пережить это время. If I had a box just for wishes Если бы у меня была шкатулка только для желаний And dreams that would never come true, И мечты, которым никогда не суждено было сбыться, The box would be empty except for the memory of how Коробка была бы пуста, если бы не воспоминание о том, как They were answered by you. Вы ответили на них. But there never seems to be enough time Но, кажется, времени никогда не хватает To do the things you wanna do Делать то, что ты хочешь делать Once you find them. Как только ты их найдешь. I\u0027ve looked around enough to know Я достаточно огляделся, чтобы знать You\u0027re the one I wanna go through time with.

Still this song reminds me evrytime that i am doing wrong again thinking about the past . So i will move on life is too short to worry about baseless unchangeable things .

If Medusa had personalities or attitudes instead of snakes for her features, her name would have been Jim Croce. But that’s unfair to you and unhealthy for me. And I now want to be the oldest man around, a man with a face full of wrinkles and lots of wisdom. So this is a birth note, Baby. And when I get back everything will be different. We’re going to have a life together, Ing, I promise. I’m gonna concentrate on my health. I’m gonna become a public hermit. I’m gonna get my Master’s Degree. I’m gonna write short stories and movie scripts. Who knows, I might even get a tan.  Give a kiss to my little man and tell him Daddy loves him.

  "There was a man who boarded an aircraft and died.  Generations would spout off what if over and over after his passing.  What if he hadn\u0027t died that fateful day.  What if he had recorded more songs.  What if.  The man much like Jim had went in prior to his death and produced his Magnum Opus which was released posthumously and became this man\u0027s only #1 song on the Billboard 100.  He was the first to do it and much like Jim who\u0027s wife received his honors in 1974, this man had a wife who was very much involved along with his record label in his career.  Both this man\u0027s wife and his record label and subsequently the musicians who backed him all said don\u0027t release this song.  It\u0027s not right for the label.  Willing himself to broaden his sound and having just recovered from surgery due to polyps on his larynx, this man told them he was releasing it and that it would be a hit.  He was right.  Unfortunately there were no touring dates for this song.  This man fondly lost himself recording the song he and his cowriter had jotted down and legend says he was sitting on that dock when he came up with the initial idea for the song.  He whistled his way into history at the end of the song and every time I hear it much like Time in a Bottle, I find myself transported wondering if perhaps Otis is still watching those ships rolling in and out of the harbor.  I don\u0027t dwell on what if he had lived. Instead I dwell on thank God he lived long enough to leave this legacy piece of his soul that would touch generations.  Thank God Jim lived to write Time in a Bottle and Thank God Ronnie Van Zant lived long enough to pen Freebird.  Whether you\u0027re sitting in the morning sun or you\u0027re asking if I could save time in a bottle or telling someone If I leave here tomorrow would you remember me, the feeling of loss we\u0027ve all felt in our lives is overwhelming.  It cuts us like a diamond, shaping our very souls into chiseled broken works of art.  From here to eternity let us lift up our voices for the time we have is fleeting and before we finish our song it may be gone.  To those who have touched us thank you.  To those who never got to sing may we hear your voice in the sweet by and by.  God Bless and thanks for reading.",

His wife, Many years/a decade (maybe more) Fought for his \"Work/Music!\"... She finally got the \"Rights to Jim\u0027s music 🎶!\" It\u0027s sad how greedy the \"Music Industry\" is... Jim would live barely average, And have \"Well-known Artist\u0027s!!!\" Come to his house and play and share stories with everyone!!! He would\u0027ve been, 80 years old today!!! I enjoy his music and expression through it, 🎶🎸🎶... Time in a bottle, Was made for his Son... He missed him while on the road, So much!!! And, Unfortunately... Past away in an airplane wreck, Coming home to be with his family... 🌹🇺🇸🎸🇺🇸🌹 🙏",
  "It says a lot about Jim Croce\u0027s talent that a horribly ugly animation can\u0027t diminish the tranquil beauty of one of the greatest love songs ever written.",
  "Awkward animation",
  "Great song. Horrible video. Where\u0027s Jim?",
  "Beautiful Lyrics 🕊",
  "With a horrible video",
  "Who pays these people ? No way on Earth ... Jim would ever let his song be disrespected like this. We as fans, love the song and it\u0027s meaning. Please refund the money you took from his estate.",
  "Bruh I did not expect it would look like this.",
  "Whatever you think of the cartoon, the music is great, magnificent . Roy b, Cape Town, South 🇿🇦 africa.",
  "This ‘art’ is dark and Jim always was positive in his songs. Even hard times he simply got on with living life in a positive manner.",
  "right but the song is very melancholy and becomes eerie when you realise that he wrote this song about being afraid that he won\u0027t be able to spend as much Time with his son as he wishes and dies a few months after his sons birth",
  "Why the quotations in \"art\"?",
  "​@@jessISaRicePrincessIt\u0027s emphasis.",
  "Que horror, al menos hubieran contratado un dibujante bueno, ¿Qué es esto? 😰",
  "What A Song.",
  "Happy birthday Jim.!!! 🎂",
  "Thanks,, cool video...",
  "What the hell is this video!? Ugly drawing.",
  "It is his birthday today! January 10th ♡♡♡♡ Feliz cumpleaños James  Idk why they didn\u0027t add that in the description 😒",
  "This is hideous. I always imagined the music video to have a lot of hourglasses and fields of wildflowers oversaturated in sunlight with lens flares, and occasionally transition to Jim playing this live with close-ups of his face or walking with his wife through the field, a silhouette from behind during the sunset",
  "This is very gen z.",
  "Hourglasses and lens flares… wow can you be more obvious?",
  "No your idea is tacky and seems like a commercial for a new prescription medicine.  you would show a young couple meeting, doing the things young people do and going out when first dating and occasionally them being a part working or traveling and then also toward the end of the video reuniting and being together again. and between all these scenes have some clips of Jim singing this song or on the road. Maybe even some pictures of Jim and Ingrid. 70% young couple, 30% Jim.",
  "Wow I had no idea so many people with no taste listened to Jim Croce and think this video looks good",
  "@@shipped_my_pants_3000 doesn’t matter, all that matters is the music. and the fact they gave us something special on his birthday.",
  "@@buff_Jeckley17 thank you :-)",
  "@@shipped_my_pants_3000 we don\u0027t care what you think of the video. We love Croce. Let it go.",
  "@@shipped_my_pants_3000 the fact that you need to comment negatively says all I need to know about you.",
  "Just everyone…SHUT THE FLOCK UP.  Thats the exact same thing Jim said while performing live on TV on late night.",
  "With all respect, Shut up dude, this is beautiful, at least to the creator and that’s all that matters. Art is transcendent and can be beautiful to some and not to others, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, just cause it doesn’t fit your opinion does not mean it’s hideous, I’m sure you couldn’t make an animation half this good, so please just appreciate creativity and uniqueness.",
  "I’m surprised at how harshly your comment was responded to.  I very much agree.  My first thought was “this video is very strange and doesn’t fit such a fantastic song.”  I’d take a bunch of lens flare and wildflowers any day.",
  "@@aaronscheuman thanks. Everybody wants to react violently on YouTube. I don\u0027t care. I have a better imagination",
  "This is called art and it\u0027s not the official music video. What you\u0027re describing is a cheesy cliche hallmark movie. Go to an art museum so you can learn to appreciate art in all its different ways",
  "guess who cares? NO ONE 😊",
  "They keeping it alive for the youngsters this is on some stranger things type shit grandma and the kids can both enjoy this off of the same pills out of the same cabinet",
  "lol this video is weird. The feet had me the most 😂 but sure it’s art. But the style of art is weird. That is okay. And we can critique or criticize art. But I think In healthy forms it’s more constructive. At the same time I’m not able to create abstract art much. I think its fascinating. But it’s not realistic. And because I lean towards realistic I’d rather just see old videos of Croce. Because this art has no connection to the song to me or artist. Except maybe the ghosty in the video is kinda close to theme. But yeah idk I’m not good at abstract so if anyone could explain that’d be great. But really some old video reels of Croce with some color burns or shifts would be cool. As for an abstract take..the feet and faces give a different vibe for the song I’m not sure fits. But just for example most old heads who are from the generation that listened to this music and Croce are gonna be like tf is this and just play the lyric video or videos of him live. And I feel like that would be the largest audience of people listening. Just will continue to be older age groups. Like does this video connect to that audience. Heck no lol. My 64 year old father and my aunts grandparents all love this song. I doubt they care about seeing a random artists art for a song that artist didn’t create. To get clicks from a popular song…. No my fam would change it. BUT if you want to Appeal to a different audience I think that’s great. I honestly would rather see these visuals for like Lofi or a Jack Stauber song. But I think it still does work for this. Great style. Really interesting and different. But idk if it’s the best fit.",
  "But you know there’s a better version by Homer Simpson. Look it up lol",
  "@@AlainaXDeann you\u0027re thinking right. Stop apologizing for being right. Everybody wants to throw their support behind something blindly nowadays. And people like you validate it by not standing up and saying it\u0027s terrible. Just like you said it has absolutely no connection to Jim\u0027s music or Jim himself. An excuse or qualifying statement is not necessary. People who have good taste need to stand by their opinion",
  "who",
  "@@shipped_my_pants_3000 \"i have a better imagination\" 💀💀💀 youre regurgitating every tragic/romantic trope that youve seen in movies and tv, yours is the most generic ive ever seen. i dont much care for this one either but at least its unique. yours is general enough for an a.i. to generate it",
  "It’s abstract art, it’s not supposed to look good or bad, it’s just supposed to be art, and if you don’t like it, just don’t watch and listen. Don’t criticise what others think looks good and you don’t, just say nothing",
  "That’s why art is objective and relative to everyone’s experience. This reminds me of my mom who passed she always listened to this so this video is pretty spot on imo 😢",
  "I agree this is very hideous Not as much as your mother of course",
