Other rap artists and The Weeknd got involved with dissing Drake because apparently, they have their own problems with him including Future and Metro. In fact, this album and their second album — We Still Don’t Trust You — is them dissing Drake.",

Lots of subliminals in that song but one thing I caught was drake only mentioning him and Cole and leaving Kendrick out of the conversation, while Cole mentions Kendrick as part of the big 3 in the song. A lot of subliminals",
  "​@@jashybooThey formed an Avengers group to take Drake down with a lot of the songs on this album and We Still Don\u0027t Trust You dissing Drake. This song set off Drake dissing all the artists on the album, multiple of them dissed Drake but went silent when Drake and Kendrick heated up the beef.",
  "​@@wowMushDrake was jealous of Kendrick but took him on tour when Kendrick was a smaller artist and barely had a real audience lmao",
  "@@djangounchained9387 they might have been cool at first but look into it. Kendrick calls Drake out in a cypher he did in 2013. Kendrick says something about the \"sensitive rapper in pajama clothes\" (I don\u0027t remember the exact lyrics) they were going back and forth for over ten years. All I\u0027m saying is it wasn\u0027t just a beef out of nowhere like many people think.",

  "@@Arthur-Lenny-Morgan That comment is referring to a signature production technique often used by Drake and his longtime producer, 40. In many of Drake’s songs, especially during emotional or introspective moments, the beat will strip down to just atmospheric elements or accentuate certain sounds, creating a “muted” or minimalistic bridge before dropping back into the full beat. Metro Boomin is known for his layered, cinematic production, but in Like That, there’s a moment where the instrumental is stripped down, emphasizing the beat in a way that mimics Drake’s style. The commenter is likely implying that Metro is subtly mocking or “dissing” Drake by using one of his own signature production moves against him, reinforcing the ongoing feud between Drake and Metro/Future/Kendrick. It’s a way of saying, “We can do your style, but better—and use it against you.”",

Collect the drugs and guns once the pilot is in the helicopter and send one officer to sail the submarine back to shore. It was a mechanical engineering project he worked on.

And it could be another Entendre for \"The Big Three\". 1st Switch: Safe (J. Cole, who is generally more laid-back and also since he apologized to Kendrick.) 2nd Switch: Semi Automatic (Drake, his disses were good but not as intense as Kendrick\u0027s.) 3rd Switch (Kendrick Lamar.

  "@aeonsage  These people are multi-millionaires in their own right. They are also humans with emotions to express. You never even bothered checking human behavior as one of the most prevalent factors at play. You never considered Drake\u0027s public behavior as a factor at all.  You\u0027re right. I\u0027m no authority in your opinion, I was just critiquing it in hopes of showing you a perspective in which why your efforts in writing it may fail.",
  "@aeonsage  Like I said, I can\u0027t speak on everyone\u0027s behalf because, surely the reasons behavior each one\u0027s narrative vary due to the nature of the fault. But acting as if money is the sole thing that\u0027s problematic here is just as subjective as who you think won the rap battle if you\u0027re talking about multimillionaires. If you don\u0027t wanna take it from me, then listen to Drake himself on rap radar, discuss why he values respect and love in music. Additional assess who he sees has highly talented and successful rappers.  Your narrative could use more nuance is all I\u0027m saying, respectfully.",
  "@aeonsage  Imma use one case to show how ignorant that assumption is. Kendrick goes 4 years without delivering an album.  Do you honestly think he cares about sales and numbers.  It ain\u0027t like he can\u0027t even produce cheap product to push, if doubt that listen to quality of his throw aways. He even has an unreleased song with the like of Andre 3000 with a fire beat he kept I\u0027m that he kept in the tuck. Again, your narrative needs more nuance. Clearly, not everyone cares about money. Even if you care about money, the internet alone shows you that there is a group of people who only respect the music.  So writing to these should better thought out or else your opinion was absolutely useless to them. There is a lot you can come to Kendrick and everyone for just to be lazy about it.",
  "@@aeonsage your opinion is dull asf. Respectfully.",
  "@lungilemake8424  ...and these multimillionaires don\u0027t give a fck about you or I, and you DEFINITELY do not know them personally, so you using human behavior to try to analyze them is why your writing fails!",

  "@@mariinorth8176 the east coast west coast beef was actually biggest and probably behind that the 50cent and jarule beef. The reason drake and Kendrick beef seems bigger is because of social media. Some people who don’t even have an interest in hip hop cover it just to get popularity on their channels and gain video views. Pretty much just riding what’s popular and using it to their advantage. 50 and ja was both mainstream rappers back in the 2000s and I’m sure if social media was there it would probably be looked at as very similar.",

  "Btw, its crazy how Kendrick has ignored Eminem\u0027s challenge to the crown in his latest drop Houdini. Kendrick called himself BIG ME and Eminem popped out! He said \"it feels like i\u0027m targeted\" The song is NOT just about the death of Slim Shady or the lightpack shade he threw at Meg...its actually a whole diss at Kendrick! J cole talking bout big 3, kendrick talking bout big me Eminem saying aye! What about me? We all waiting same way we wait to see Ross respond to The Game\u0027s savage callout...",
  "Brother kendrick is way better than eminem also to him eminem is one of his inspiration and he loves and respects him. He will never battle eminem ever. That\u0027s like saying messi needs to 1v1 maradona🤡🤡🤡. Nas never battled rakim but nas is better. Eminem needs to drop a good album and you stans need to stfu",
  "Eminem is pushing 60 and don’t got an album better than GKMC/TPAB respectfully.  He can rap his ass off but he’s not saying anything important anymore",
  "@treycarter7826  why don\u0027t you stfu ain\u0027t nobody asked you to respond! Kendrick wont battle him cuz he know Eminem will fck him up! Kendrick don\u0027t like culture vultures and Eminem is one plus he fully white not half white like Drake. If he saying he the king he should stand on it and defend his crown 👑 but we understand ...that\u0027s sumthin\u0027 he don\u0027t want to do.",
  "@poetryismyting8854  pushing 60 doesn\u0027t mean he lost his abilities. You should know that with the poetry name you using.",
  "@@aeonsage he put out trash albums recently objectively. His prime was amazing but he didn\u0027t sustain while other hiphop artists have. Eminem is not even the best white rapper ever El p is. He actually has a strong argument for top 5 ever given his solo work and work with run the jewels but you are just a causal hiphop fan",
  "​@@treycarter7826 Even more reason for Kendrick to defend his crown! You can\u0027t call yourself BIG ME and say \"I CHOOSE VIOLENCE!\"  and NOT defend that sh*t when you\u0027re challenged! , He said Drake soft, he\u0027s white, he\u0027s a culture vulture and all that and more. Here\u0027s Em, hes everything he called Drake! Eminem  said \"How can I explain to you? That even myself I\u0027m a danger too...I\u0027m the fight you all getting when you debate who the best!\" Clear call out!! Kendrick would be a p**sy not to respond!",
  "@@aeonsage Becuase I’m poet is why I’m telling you kendrick is better. Eminem isn’t saying anything impactful despite his oversaturated/overused technical ability. Eminem isn’t even in the same competitive leg as Kendrick (you’re reaching Bcuz em and Dot are cool) right now. Eminem is a veteran who’s still rapping beyond when he should be. Fortunately he has his core fans, but he’s not improving or adding anything to hip hop culture anymore. I’m not competing with - respectfully - washed up Emcee who isn’t putting out better music or in the convo with me for who’s impactful from my run of emcees. It’s like a college basketball player Trying to call out the best middle school player .",
  "@poetryismyting8854  Because you\u0027re a poet, then you clearly know Eminem is better as a rapper. The fact that Eminem called him out in Houdini, doesn\u0027t suggest they\u0027re not on friendly terms,  it suggests Kendrick should show some f**ckn RESPECT when he\u0027s talking about HE is the best and that the crown is heavy! They both have storytelling abilities, personal childhood struggles, family issues, and have both addressed mental health issues, racism and police violence thru their lyrics and can both switch up their styles in a song on a dime. But Eminem is better cuz unlike Kendrick, his rapid fire multi-syllable rhymes, his manipulation of words, and the speed in which he can deliver complex bars is exceptional 👌 and he is gonna reach a wider, global and more \"white\" audience cuz  his fanbase is unmatched worldwide. Kendrick cannot come at Em like he did Drake even though Em is fully white, a culture vulture and not a part of the culture by Kendrick\u0027s logic! So he\u0027s being a phony to not respond and stand on his pro-black, moral principles!So sorry you can\u0027t cancel him no matter how hard you try. He\u0027ll retire when HE ALONE makes that decision.",
  "@@aeonsage I ain’t “cancelling him” . Kendrick just ranks higher. All Eminem has going on a rap basis is his fast flow/technicality. Kendrick is the better storyteller, performer, lyricists, artist, song writer, and has more versatility. Kendrick ranks higher on the all time list when it’s all said and Done.  If you only listen to mainstream Kendrick I get why you’re deluded. Eminem of course has more influence and the larger audience... but he’s not the better music artist where it matters.",
  "​@poetryismyting8854 I do understand your delusion as well! The point is...Eminem called Kendrick out! Kendrick should respond! Likewise, The Game called Rick Ross out, Ross should respond! Yall can\u0027t say all these people tough, have streetcred and all the stuff that hiphop culture encapsulates and then tuck your tail between your legs and run when someone calls you on your BS. J Cole said it\u0027s big 3, Drake said its Big D, Kendrick says its BIG ME!! EM says, when y\u0027all debating who\u0027s the best \"I\u0027m the fight you all getting. \" and he said \"F\" YOU to  Dr Dre, his kids, his manager, and EVERYONE trying to cancel him and act as if he doesn\u0027t count.",

Nigga it’s just big me.” (B!tching them. Basically who’s gonna check me?) 2:45- (said Drake’s best work was a light pack) “Prince outlived Mike Jack” (Drake compares himself to MJ, but Kdot is saying he [prince] will musically outlast him)  Lastly, Kendrick uses Drake’s fandom name, dogs, and explains that K (kendrick) is a King amongst nines (9) which is a play on the word canine. ❤️‍🔥 Dope af with the pen",

All I’m saying is that drake is a more popular figure. The numbers back that up. You don’t have to be hostile about it, or go into attack mode. Just stating the obvious.  Anything other than “Kendrick is god” is shot down by blow hards that don’t even know the guy lol. Weird flex 💪",
  "@@grandtheftaudio6386 I need to squash this right now. I said Kendrick is a better artist and I believe it. For anyone that likes real hip hop, they’re aware of this. I literally just said that drake is just a more popular figure and appeals to more broad masses. I said he sold his soul… that is definitely not a compliment or a plea to lean drakes way lol.",
  "@@ToneX3 I\u0027m not hostile. I\u0027m just saying as someone who was at the pop out and has seen Kendrick perform live before, I can 100% tell you that he\u0027s the better entertainer.",
  "@@Dizaster404 drakes better in the sense that he appeals to more broad audiences, that’s what I hoped to convey. Not that he’s a better rapper or performer. Just that he’s cornered the broader market.  2 year olds and 90 year olds of all races and religions listen to drake. Only real hip hop fans listen to Kendrick.. but that’s a good thing. He didn’t sell his soul and agree to too much other than the occasional (Taylor swift type stuff) that’s outside of his realm.  My comment was paying him homage, not dissing him. He kept it real and I don’t think drake knows the meaning of the word real.",
  "@@ToneX3 hm I agree that he relates to a wider audience.",
  "@@Dizaster404 he does. It’s a good business strategy, but real fans of hip hop know the difference between rap and bubble gum rap. I’m glad there are ppl like Kendrick keeping the real art alive.",
  "@ToneX3  if I sounded like I was trying to argue with you then my bad, g.   I was just offering a counter point to the better  \"better entertainer\" bit of your statement.",
  "@@grandtheftaudio6386 I like and appreciate that. I think I said it in a way that could’ve been misinterpreted. Kenny is real hip hop. Drake is pop music. I like that k didn’t lose himself and kept it real.",

I hate when he changes his voice and style mid song. It comes off weird at times. Either way, he’s a way more talented artist and writes everything himself, and he’s a man who holds himself accountable.  Drake uses every P.R stunt, has 100 writers and consultants dictating his every move. At least Ken is himself.",
  "Yep, the \"grunt and mumble\" semi-literate , degrading auto-\u003dtuned squeak is hard to listen to!!!",

  "@@tompaulcampbell wtf you talking about? Got calk in the ears?",
  "@@WombRaider204 It’s whatever. I don’t blame Drake for selling out. If someone was dangling that kind of money at me I’d probably cave too. The problem is, he grew up with money, and he sort of got this god complex after he started rapping and getting popular. But Kenny’s a real one. Made his career from being humble and real and still ended up with way more money than I have (or most people for that matter).",

I don\u0027t see the point of having Drake on an album you are dissing him, except for Good Kid M.A.A.D City with Poetic Justice. Kendrick making fun of Drake on Poetic Justice and allegedly ghostwriting Drake\u0027s verse that ends with Drake saying \"But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real\" is so funny, you could say that\u0027s poetic justice 😭 (btw even Drake on buried alive interlude pt.2 says \"It\u0027s how you felt in 2011, why we wastin\u0027 time?\" so it implies that Kendrick has had an issue with the things Drake has been doing even back then, If you think this is a reach check out Look Out For Detox by Kendrick Lamar which has a Drake diss that sounds very similar to something he says on Euphoria.",

(Verse 1) Got the rhythm, got the flow, yeah, I\u0027m living it, Drizzy in my rearview, ain\u0027t no limit, kid, Toronto to the world, but I\u0027m global, see, Got my name on the charts, you know where I\u0027ll be. You talkin\u0027 \u0027bout the woes, man, I\u0027m talkin\u0027 \u0027bout wins, While you\u0027re reminiscing, I\u0027m collecting my bins, Champagne Papi?

I\u0027m the new wave, call me the tide, While you\u0027re stuck on the shore, I\u0027m the one they ride, You had your Degrassi days, now it\u0027s my stage, In the book of rap, I\u0027m the newest page.

(Bridge) Got my eyes on the prize, no looking back, While you\u0027re stuck in the past, I\u0027m on the attack, Leveling up, every track\u0027s a hit, You can keep your old news, I\u0027m the new fit.

Mj paved the way for pop stars bc all his stuff just so happened to turn into hits. His intention wasn\u0027t to create hits. He gave his life and soul to his music and every performance to him was extrramly meticulously planned out. He was a once in a lifetime act.

Like you were born with that knowledge on those days. There aren\u0027t many people like that.

  "That \"Mike Jack\" reference... It\u0027s also a double meaning for Drake stealing lyrics from people. Also Michael Jackson is the King of Pop... so he\u0027s saying that he\u0027s the Prince and he\u0027s gonna outlast the King of rhyme thieves! It\u0027s acually really brilliant",

I still got PTSD” I’m wondering now after “meet the grahams” and “not like us” if Kendrick saw some shit at Drakes house that he decided to not be apart of but didn’t want to directly call him out. When drake brought Whitney and their son in, all bets were off and Kendrick quite literally dropped the location of the embassy with the predators markings on it.",
