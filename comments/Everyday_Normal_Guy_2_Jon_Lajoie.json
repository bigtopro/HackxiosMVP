De volta ao estilo Back in the heezy Poderíamos fazer isso o ano inteiro We could do this all year long (Sou só um filho da puta normal do dia a dia) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Eu disse pra vocês na primeira música, vou dizer nessa segunda também I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (Sou só um filho da puta normal do dia a dia) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Não tenho uma namorada, minha mão é minha única amante I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (Sou só um filho da puta normal do dia a dia) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Uma noite por semana, minha mãe gosta de preparar o jantar pra mim One night a week, my mom likes to cook me supper (Sou só um filho da puta normal do dia a dia) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) E o Michael Keaton era meu Batman favorito And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman Outro dia eu estava caminhando pela rua I was walking down the street just the other day Eu vi duas minas gatinhas, elas estavam vindo na minha direção I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way Ei, o que vocês vão fazer hoje à noite? Foi o que eu queria perguntar Yo, what you girls doing tonight? Is what I wanted to say Mas de repente entrei em pânico, minha voz começou a tremer But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake Foi aí que abaixei a cabeça e continuei caminhando So I put my head down and I just walked away De qualquer forma, eu tinha que pegar o ônibus, isso deu certo I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Entrei no ônibus, coloquei meu fone de ouvido e apertei o botão Tocar Got on the bus, put my headphones on and pressed Play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt e a porra do Ace of Base Sheryl Crow, James Blunt and motherfucking Ace of Base Ei, o que posso dizer? É só mais um dia na minha vida Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life De manhã eu levanto bem cedo, à noite também vou pra cama cedo I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night Pra ser produtivo no trabalho, tenho que estar bem descansado To be productive at work, I gotta be well rested Sim, filho da puta, você ouviu o que acabei de dizer Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said (Sou só um filho da puta normal do dia a dia) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Não gosto de margarina, prefiro muito mais o sabor da manteiga I don\u0027t like margerine, I much prefer the taste of butter (Sou só um filho da puta normal do dia a dia) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Meus filmes favoritos quando criança eram Superman e  Ghostbusters My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (Sou só um filho da puta normal do dia a dia) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Tenho dificuldade em abrir meus olhos debaixo d\u0027água I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (Sou só um filho da puta normal do dia a dia) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) E não sou grande fã do Nicolas Cage And I\u0027m not a huge Nicolas Cage fan Sou de uma família de classe média baixa I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Eu e meus irmãos e irmãs brincávamos de esconde-esconde Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek Tenho boas lembranças da minha infância, vadia I have good memories from my childhood, bitch Meu brinquedo favorito era a porra do meu caminhão de bombeiros, vadia My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch Eu costumava brincar com essa porra o dia inteiro I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Até aprender sobre sexo no catálogo da Sears Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog E foi aí que comecei a brincar com meu amiguinho o dia inteiro And then I played with my motherfucker all day long Quase dez vezes por dia, cara, o ano inteiro About ten times a day, man, all year long Minha música favorita, filho da puta, não gosto de admitir My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it É uma da Céline Dion, do filme Titanic Is a Céline Dion song from the movie Titanic (Todas as noites, nos meus sonhos, eu te vejo, eu te sinto) (Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you) Toda vez que ouço essa merda, uma lágrima vem nos meus olhos Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Por que o Leonardo DiCaprio teve que morrer, porra? Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die? Embora eu não tenha medo de dizer que sou um cara sensível Though I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Paus e pedras quebram meus ossos, mas são as palavras que me fazem chorar Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Como naquela vez na terceira série, quando uma garota me chamou de Cara de Idiota Like that time in grade three when a girl called me Stupid Face Ela realmente me magoou, por que ela me chamou de Cara de Idiota? She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Será que minha cara é idiota? Como isso é possível? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? Uma pessoa pode ser idiota, mas uma cara, isso é impossível A person could be stupid, but a face, that\u0027s impossible Essas merdas acontecem o tempo todo e você aprende a lidar com elas Shit happens all the time and you learn how to deal with it Uma coisa normal do dia a dia Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit (Sou só um filho da puta normal do dia a dia) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Quando entro numa briga, geralmente termino numa maca When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (Sou só um filho da puta normal do dia a dia) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Quando não tenho nada a dizer, normalmente falo sobre o tempo When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (Sou só um filho da puta normal do dia a dia) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Gosto do primeiro Back to the Future, mas o segundo foi melhor I like the first Back to the Future, but the second one was better (Sou só um filho da puta normal do dia a dia) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Gosto de pimentas vermelhas mais do que as verdes I like red peppers better than the green ones Buá, estou economizando pra comprar uma nova máquina de lavar Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher A minha quebrou há uns seis meses Mine broke about six months ago Filho da puta Motherfucker Vai, vai, vai, vai, vai, gatinha Go, go, go, go, go, shorty É o seu aniversário It\u0027s your birthday Vá festejar como se fosse o seu aniversário Go party like it\u0027s your birthday Eu não fui convidado, mas tudo bem I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay Vou ficar em casa e jogar um pouco de videogame I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

  "\"Average Daily Dude\" (Verse 1) Yo, I wake up at seven, snooze \u0027til eight, Breakfast is toast—oops, burned my plate. I check my phone, zero messages there, Guess my social life\u0027s chill, like Tupperware. I’m not a baller, no stacks, no whip, I got a secondhand Honda with a busted clip. I shop at Walmart, not designer brands, My style’s so basic, I confuse my own friends. (Chorus) I’m an average daily dude, just living my life, No big plans, no spotlight, no drama or strife. I’m a regular Joe, no billionaire clues, Just a couch, some snacks, and Netflix queues. (Verse 2) I’m not a TikTok king, no viral flair, Last post I made got three likes—who cares? I still play old games like Mario Kart, But rage quit every time \u0027cause I suck at the start. My cooking’s a joke, ramen’s my go-to, When I try to make steak, it turns into shoe. My love life\u0027s a ghost town, tumbleweed rolls, I’m more awkward than a dad at middle school shows. (Chorus) I’m an average daily dude, just living my life, No big plans, no spotlight, no drama or strife. I’m a regular Joe, no billionaire clues, Just a couch, some snacks, and Netflix queues. (Bridge) Yeah, I’m fine with my vibe, no flex, no brag, My wardrobe’s just hoodies and a beat-up bag. Dreams of fame? Nah, I’m good on that, I’d rather binge-watch shows in my sweatpants flat. (Outro) So here’s my story, it’s simple, no doubt, Not flashy or wild, but it’s what I’m about. To all my average folks, just know it’s okay, We’re the glue of the world, every single day. (Chorus) I’m an average daily dude, just living my life, No big plans, no spotlight, no drama or strife. I’m a regular Joe, no billionaire clues, Just a couch, some snacks, and Netflix queues.",

Many of them with intent to kill on both sides. My favorite movie since I was 9 was Lethal Weapon and my favorite TV show was The Walking dead since I was 7. I have trouble writing lyrics to songs not because I have too little to write about, but because I keep trying to include too much and have to start over. I realized Santa wasn\u0027t real with a math equation when I realized sonic booms existed. I took taekwondo for five years but I prefer to just hit my opponents with a water bottle because it\u0027s quicker and easier. I\u0027m angry all the time but I suppress it and it boils over sometimes. That\u0027s gotten me into trouble. The reason I haven\u0027t been in any fights at my new school is that I\u0027ve let out my anger by talking to people and I\u0027m kicking lockers. I intimidate people because they can\u0027t figure me out. I wear a book strapped to my chest with my old belt everyday. I frequently challenge people to hit me. When I do that it seems that I get in less arguments. Thanks! I just figured out a lot of stuff. I know why I got blackmailed now too.",

It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I gotta be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said [Chorus] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t like margerine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were \"Superman\" and \"Ghostbusters\" (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicolas Cage fan [Verse 2] I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Céline Dion Song from the movie Titanic (Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you) Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die? Though I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones But it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three When a girl called me \"Stupid Face\" She really hurt me Why\u0027d she call me \"Stupid Face\"?

A person could be stupid, but a face, that\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit [Chorus] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back to the Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones [Outro] Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago... Motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shorty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home, and play some video games",

  "Yo, they call me Spiderman in the Chi in Illinoise...... I\u0027ve been dancing, kicking a hacky sack, drumming, doing clothing design and writing poetry myself for nearly 40 years and dancing over 40. It\u0027s joints like this that make me want to make my mark as an artist even at 65 plus years of age. I wouldn\u0027t have a problem repping as the Grandpa Moses of rap as long as I didn\u0027t bring karap...... Your style is clean bold easy to behold.... It doesn\u0027t ask to get paid or to be sold.... It just does what it does and plays it\u0027s unique role..... I hope you have stayed in the game because too much of what people accept as music, rap or otherwise is way to homogeneous, bland and makes me want to read the club owners the riot act..... If we have to break it back to keep it real that\u0027s OK because I need to feel the real, to feel the juice to make my bones and muscles want to get loose or to loosen my pen when I\u0027ve got something to say...... Even though I will never worship the dollar holler..... You deserve to be paid..... Whether that\u0027s respect, work, or dollars so plenty you leave some in the dirt..... Always know your self worth..... You KNOW HOW TO WORK",

It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face?

Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

  "Haven\u0027t heard it since you dropped the first bomb. I really like this song and your humor  so much. It\u0027s pure genius. Rappers talk only about their self how great they are, when at the end they\u0027re all the same. But this song speaks for all people cause no one is special. Combining it with that overselfesteem typical rappers attitude is too funny cause it\u0027s true. You don\u0027t know how much fun I have with your comedy and how often I heard this song. It\u0027s better than \"official\" music. Best rap song ever heard. And believe me i listen to rap my whole life for 30 years. Heard them all nowherdays I\u0027m more into death metal. Just want to say, your song is very philosophical and funny as hell. Your true comedian and musician. Respect bro!",

Motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shorty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home, and play some video games",

  "My name is Yoshikage Kira. I\u0027m 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don\u0027t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I\u0027m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I\u0027m trying to explain that I\u0027m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn\u0027t lose to anyone. -A Regular Everyday Normal MF",

It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (Solo soy un hijo de puta normal todos los días) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Mis películas favoritas cuando era niño eran Superman y Cazafantasmas. My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (Solo soy un hijo de puta normal todos los días) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Me cuesta abrir los ojos bajo el agua I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (Solo soy un hijo de puta normal todos los días) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Y no soy un gran fan de Nicholas Cage. And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan soy de una familia de clase media baja I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Yo y mis hermanos y hermanas jugamos al escondite Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek Tengo buenos recuerdos de mi infancia, perra I have good memories from my childhood, bitch Mi juguete favorito era mi maldito camión de bomberos, perra My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch Solía ​​jugar con ese hijo de puta todo el día. I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Hasta que supe de sexo por el catálogo de Sears Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog Y luego jugué con mi hijo de puta todo el día And then I played with my motherfucker all day long Unas diez veces al día, hombre, durante todo el año. About ten times a day, man, all year long Mi canción favorita, hijo de puta, no me gusta admitirlo My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Es una canción de Celine Dion de la película Titanic Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Cada noche en mis sueños, te veo, te siento Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Cada vez que escucho esa maldita mierda, se me salta una lágrima Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye ¿Por qué diablos tuvo que morir Leonardo DiCaprio? Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, no tengo miedo de decir que soy un tipo sensible Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Palos y piedras rompen mis huesos, pero son las palabras las que me hacen llorar Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Como aquella vez en tercer grado, cuando una chica me llamó Cara de Estúpido. Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face Realmente me lastimó, ¿por qué me llama cara de estúpido? She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? ¿Es mi cara estúpida? Is my face stupid? ¿Cómo es eso posible? How\u0027s that even possible? Una persona puede ser estúpida, pero ¿una cara? A person could be stupid, but a face? Eso es imposible That\u0027s impossible La mierda sucede todo el tiempo, y aprendes a lidiar con eso. Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Jodidas tonterías normales de todos los días Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit Cuando me meto en una pelea, suelo salir en camilla. When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (Solo soy un hijo de puta normal todos los días) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Cuando no tengo nada que decir, suelo hablar del tiempo When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (Solo soy un hijo de puta normal todos los días) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Me gusta la primera de Regreso al futuro, pero la segunda fue mejor I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (Solo soy un hijo de puta normal todos los días) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Me gustan más los pimientos rojos que los verdes. I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, ahorrando mi dinero para ir a comprar un lavavajillas nuevo Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher El mío se rompió hace unos seis meses, hijo de puta. Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Ve, ve, ve, ve, ve shawty Go, go, go, go, go shawty Es tu cumpleaños It\u0027s your birthday Vete de fiesta como si fuera tu cumpleaños Go party like it\u0027s your birthday No fui invitado, pero está bien.

  "Lyrics [Intro: Steve] You want some more of this, b*tch? Back in the heezy... We could do this all year long [Chorus: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman [Verse 1: Jon Lajoie] I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine b*tches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfu*king Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfu*ker, you heard what I just said [Chorus 2: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicolas Cage fan [Verse 2: Jon Lajoie] I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, b*tch My favorite toy was my fu*king firetruck, b*tch I used to play with that motherfu*ker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfu*ker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfu*ker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic (Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you) Every time I hear that fu*king shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fu*k did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say admit that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones But it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three When a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me... Why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face, that\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fu*king bullshit [Chorus 3: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) I like the first Back to the Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) I like red peppers better than the green ones [Verse 3: Jon Lajoie] Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago... Motherfu*ker Go, go, go, go, go shorty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home, and play some video games",

Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

  "Even an \"everyday normal guy\" is a sinner in the eyes of a HOLY and RIGHTEOUS GOD! You need to get saved by The Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "HOW TO BE SAVED: Repent: Acts 20:21 Authorized (King James) Version “testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.” 2 Corinthians 7:9 \"Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.\" KJV. 2 Corinthians 7:10 \"For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.\" KJV. Understand YOU ARE A SINNER and only The Lord Jesus Christ can save you: Romans 3:20-26 Authorized (King James) Version “20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. 21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; 22 even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 23 for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 24 being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 25 whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; 26 to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.” Romans 3:10 \"as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:\" KJV. Put your faith in the Gospel: 1 Corinthians 15:1-4  \"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:\" KJV For added assurance of salvation, call upon the name of The Lord (The Lord Jesus Christ) for salvation: Romans 10:8-13  \"But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; 9 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. 12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\" KJV. Believe in the FINISHED work of THE LORD Jesus Christ on the cross. No sacraments or works can save you; only Jesus can save you. John 19:30 Authorized (King James) Version “30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.”",

It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

  "Lyrics [Intro: Steve] You want some more of this, b*tch? Back in the heezy... We could do this all year long [Chorus: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman [Verse 1: Jon Lajoie] I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine b*tches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfu*king Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfu*ker, you heard what I just said [Chorus 2: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicolas Cage fan [Verse 2: Jon Lajoie] I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, b*tch My favorite toy was my fu*king firetruck, b*tch I used to play with that motherfu*ker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfu*ker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfu*ker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic (Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you) Every time I hear that fu*king shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fu*k did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say admit that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones But it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three When a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me... Why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face, that\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fu*king bullshit [Chorus 3: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) I like the first Back to the Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfu*ker) I like red peppers better than the green ones [Verse 3: Jon Lajoie] Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago... Motherfu*ker Go, go, go, go, go shorty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home, and play some video games",

It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

  "News flash Jon: you can stop crying now because as it turns out, Leonardo DiCaprio didn\u0027t die in the Celine Dion movie. He managed to swim to New York where he became the Wolf of Wall Street. Just thought you should know!  I know it might\u0027ve look like that Leonardo DiCaprio drowned, but in actuality, he was just done with the check because he got to bang her and it was easier just to feign his own death than have an awkward goodbye.",

It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherf*****, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherf*****) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherf*****) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherf*****) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, b**** My favorite toy was my f****** firetruck, b**** I used to play with that motherf***** all day long Until I learned about s** from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherf***** all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherf*****, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that f****** s***, a tear comes to my eye Why the f*** did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible S**** happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal f****** bulls*** When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherf*****) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherf*****) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherf*****) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, mothef***** Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video game This took me so long but its worth it for a song like this, Respect to Jon Lajoie  👍",

Eventually one of the flight attendants came over and asked Oloff if he would perform one of his songs to calm Jar Jar down, and when Oloff began rapping the first verse to Doing It Stealthy, Jar Jar immediately relaxed. To this day the two are still close friends.",

Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games ❤️",

It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay",

Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say?

Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

  "Steve: You want some more of this bitch? Back in the heezy. We can do this all year long. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka... I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... I don\u0027t have a girlfriend my hand\u0027s my only lover. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka... One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman. I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches they were walkin\u0027 my way \"Yo whatchu girls doin tonight?\" is what I wanted to say but suddenly I panicked my voice started to shake. so I put my head down and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great. Got on the bus put my headphones on and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfuckin Ace of Base. Yo, what can I say, it\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning in bed early at night. To be productive at work I gotta be well rested. Yeah muthafucka, you heard what I just said. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka... I don\u0027t like margarine I much prefer the taste of butter. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka... I have a hard time opening my eyes under water. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... and I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan. I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family, me and my brothers and sisters played hide and seek, I have good memories from my childhood bitch, my favorite toy was my fuckin fire truck bitch, I used to play with that motherfucker all day long, until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog and then I played with my muthafucka all day long about 10 times a day man, all year long. My favorite song motherfucker I don\u0027t like to admit it is a Celine Dion song from the movie Titanic. \"Every night in my dreams, I see you...I feel you...\" Every time I hear that fuckin shit a tear comes to my eye. Why the fuck did Leonardo Di Caprio have to die? Though I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy, sticks and stones break my bones but it\u0027s the words that make me cry. Like that time in Grade 3 when a girl called me stupid face, she really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me stupid face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person can be stupid but a face? That\u0027s impossible. Shit happens all the time and you learn how to deal with it, Regular, everday, normal fuckin\u0027 bullshit. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka... When I get into a fight I usually leave on a stretcher. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... When I got nothin\u0027 to say I usually talk about the weather. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka... I like the 1st Back to the Future but the 2nd one was better. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... I like red peppers better than the green ones. Ooooohoooooo...savin up my money to go buy a new dishwasher. Mine broke about 6 months ago. Mother fucker. Go Go Go Go Go shorty, it\u0027s your birthday, Go party like it\u0027s your birthday. I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay. I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games.

  "Repent of your sins and believe on Adonai Jesus Christ, believe in your heart that He has died for sins and rose from the tomb on the third day and let the Holy Spirit within you, and you shall be saved. - Evidence for Jesus Christ’s existence, crucifixion, and disappearance from the grave (He rose from it): The Lord Jesus Christ did exist, gathered disciples, and was crucified and went missing from the grave. To argue about wether He was taken from the grave or rose from it, is an argument a skeptic can make. Because well if you disregard the eye witness testimony of the disciples and there willingness to die for Christ, and humans won’t die for something they know is a lie, when Peter is pinned upside down to that cross, he could have said that it was a fake, but He didn’t because it wasn’t, what care would he have about death in this world if he knew for a fact he had assurance of a life in another, Jesus Christ did rise from the grave and is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Now the evidence for the Lord Jesus Christ’s existence really isn’t hard to find a multitude of non-Christian scholars and historians mention Him within 150 years after the time of His life. One such is Tacitus a Roman historian who reported on emperor nero’s decision to blame the Christians for the fire that had destroyed rome in 64 AD. Tacitus wrote: “Nero fastened the guilt ... on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of ... Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome…” In this Tacitus makes reference to not only Christians, but Christ calling Him Christus and confirming the Gospels going on to say that He suffered the extreme penalty (crucifixion) under the reign of Tiberius and by the sentence of Pontius Pilate, which like I said confirms the Gospels narrative.  Another important source of evidence about Jesus and early Christianity can be found in the letters of Pliny the Younger to Emperor Trajan. Pliny was the Roman governor of Bithynia in Asia Minor. In one of his letters, dated around A.D. 112, he asks Trajan\u0027s advice about the appropriate way to conduct legal proceedings against those accused of being Christians. Pliny says that he needed to consult the emperor about this issue because a great multitude of every age, class, and sex stood accused of Christianity. At one point in his letter, Pliny relates some of the information he has learned about these Christians: “They were in the habit of meeting on a certain fixed day before it was light, when they sang in alternate verses a hymn to Christ, as to a god, and bound themselves by a solemn oath, not to any wicked deeds, but never to commit any fraud, theft or adultery, never to falsify their word, nor deny a trust when they should be called upon to deliver it up; after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble to partake of food – but food of an ordinary and innocent kind.” This passage provides a number of interesting insights into the beliefs and practices of early Christians. First, we see that Christians regularly met on a certain fixed day for worship. Second, their worship was directed to Christ, demonstrating that they firmly believed in His divinity. Furthermore, one scholar interprets Pliny\u0027s statement that hymns were sung to Christ, \"as to a god\", as a reference to the rather distinctive fact that, \"unlike other gods who were worshipped, Christ was a person who had lived on earth.\" If this interpretation is correct, Pliny understood that Christians were worshipping an actual historical person as God! Of course, this agrees perfectly with the New Testament doctrine that Jesus was both God and man. You may have heard of the scholar Flavius Josephus who mentioned James as being the brother of the Lord Jesus Christ, which matches what Paul said calling James “The Lord’s brother” and there is another document that Josephus may have written which goes: “About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man. For he ... wrought surprising feats.... He was the Christ. When Pilate ...condemned him to be crucified, those who had . . . come to love him did not give up their affection for him. On the third day he appeared ... restored to life.... And the tribe of Christians ... has ... not disappeared.” Now it’s up to debate wether this is the entirely original document of what Josephus wrote, or if a Christian had edited it. But regardless he wrote about the Lord Jesus Christ. Wether it was negative or positive like the possible document is. Anyways there are many other statements, documents, letters, and writings of all sorts from the ancient world talking about the Lord Jesus Christ and there is not one question if He was a real person or if He was crucified and went missing from the grave. That is clear as day, He is a real person, was crucified, and went missing from the grave. And He did rise from the grave. And for more evidence of the Lord Jesus Christ, there’s the Bible and you see there is no evidence the Bible is corrupted, a lie, created by the Roman government, folktale. It is the recount of the Disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, now wether you want to believe it is up to you. And what profit was there in spreading Christianity, All the early Christian suffered persecution, beatings, and were killed. Another Scholar reported that James the Lord’s Brother was thrown off a building and then stoned to death for spreading the Gospel in Jerusalem. These people went to great lengths even giving their own lives for the Adonai Jesus Christ.",

  "@JonLajoie.  This is a very chill song. I’m in my 50’s and still really like it.   I actually used to produce major music videos (Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Will Smith, U2, Lenny Kravitz, Busta Rhymes, Stevie Wonder, Jamie Fox, Celine Dion, Jennifer Lopez, etc). I state some of my credits just to qualify that I have been around some great music and do really enjoy this straight forward song. Awesome!  I’m curious what you’re doing these days?  Forgive me for asking, but I’ve become that guy who asks “who is that?” when referring to a current singer or band.   Oh, I produce mostly (boring) commercials these days and I do miss my music video days (early 2000’s).",

A person can be stupid, but a face, that’s impossible Shit happens all the time and you learn how to deal with it  Regular everyday normal fuckin’ bullshit I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker… When I get into a fight I usually leave on a stretcher I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker… When I’ve got nothing to say I usually talk about the weather I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker… I liked the first «Back to the future» but the second one was better I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker… I like red peppers better than the green ones Ou-ouhh, Savin’ up my money to buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about 6 months ago Motherfucker Go Go Go Go Go Charlie It’s your birthday Go party like it’s your birthday I wasn’t invited but its okay I just stayed at home and played some videogames",

It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

I don\u0027t like margarine I much prefer the taste of butter I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... My favorite movies as a kid were superman and ghostbusters I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... And I\u0027m not a huge Nicolas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fuckin\u0027 fire truck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalogue and then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song motherfucker I don\u0027t like to admit it Is the Celine Dion song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams I see you I feel you Everytime I hear that fucking shit a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo Dicaprio had to die Though I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones but its the worst that make me cry Like that time in grade three when girl called me stupid face She really hurt me, Why did she called me stupid face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person can be stupid, but a face, that\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fuckin\u0027 bullshit I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... When I get into a fight I usually leave on a stretcher I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... When I\u0027ve got nothing to say I usually talk about the weather I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... I liked the first \"Back to the future\" but the second one was better I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... I like red peppers better than the green ones Ou-ouhh, Savin\u0027 up my money to buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about 6 months ago Motherfucker Go Go Go Go Go Charlie It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited but its okay I just stayed at home and played some videogames",

It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

  "Everyday Normal Guy 2 Lyrics [Intro: Steve] You want some more of this, bitch? Back in the heezy... We could do this all year long [Chorus: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman [Verse 1: Jon Lajoie] I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said [Chorus 2: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicolas Cage fan [Verse 2: Jon Lajoie] I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic (Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you) Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die? Though I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones But it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three When a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me Why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face, that\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit [Chorus 3: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back to the Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones [Verse 3: Jon Lajoie] Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago... Motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shorty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home, and play some video games [Outro: Steve] You want some of this, come and get it",

You are the source of my joy, the center of my world and the whole of my heart. God is keeping me alive but you are keeping me in love. I don\u0027t need paradise because I found you. I don\u0027t need dreams because I already have you. Everywhere I look I am reminded of your love. You are my world. You are the last thought in my mind before I drift off to sleep and the first thought when I wake up each morning. If you text \u0027I love you\u0027 to a person and the person writes back an emoji — no matter what that emoji is, they don\u0027t love you back. When I tell you I love you, I am not saying it out of habit, I am reminding you that you are my life. You are the answer to every prayer I\u0027ve offered. I still fall in love with you every day. All that you are is all that I\u0027ll ever need. 1. I need to tell you a secret; look at 5. 2. The answer is.... look at 11. 3. Don\u0027t get mad, look at 15. 4. Calm down don\u0027t be mad, look at 13. 5. First look at 2. 6. Dont be that angry look at 12. 7. I just wanted to say I love you. 8. What I wanted to tell you is.. THE ANSWER IS ON 14. 9. Be patient look at 4. 10. This is the last time I am going to do this look at 7. 11. I hope you are not mad when I say this; look at 6. 12. Sorry look at 8. 13. Dont get mad, look at 10. 14. I dont know how to say this but look at 3.  15. You must be really mad look at number 9......",

  "Lyrics: I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka…  I told you in the first song, I’ll tell you in another.  I’m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker…  I don’t have a girlfriend my hand’s my only lover.  I’m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka…  One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper.  I’m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker…  And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman.  I was walking down the street just the other day  I saw these two fine bitches  they were walkin’ my way  “Yo whatchu girls doin tonight?”  is what I wanted to say  but suddenly I panicked  my voice started to shake.  so I put my head down  and I just walked away  I had a bus to catch anyway,  it worked out great.  Got on the bus put my headphones on and pressed play  Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfuckin Ace of Base.  Yo, what can I say,  it’s just a day in my life  I’m up early in the morning  in bed early at night.  To be productive at work  I gotta be well rested.  Yeah muthafucka,  you heard what I just said.  I’m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka…  I don’t like margarine I much prefer the taste of butter.  I’m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker…  My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters.  I’m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka…  I have a hard time opening my eyes under water.  I’m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker…  and I’m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan.  I’m from a  lower-middle class family,  me and my brothers and sisters  played hide and seek,  I have good memories  from my childhood bitch,  my favorite toy  was my fuckin fire truck bitch,  I used to play with that motherfucker all day long,  until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog  and then I played with my muthafucka all day long  about 10 times a day man, all year long.  My favorite song motherfucker  I don’t like to admit it  is a Celine Dion song  from the movie Titanic.  “Every night in my dreams,  I see you…I feel you…”  Every time I hear that fuckin shit  a tear comes to my eye.  Why the fuck did Leonardo Di Caprio have to die?  Though I’m not afraid to say  that I’m a sensitive guy,  sticks and stones break my bones  but it’s the words that make me cry.  Like that time in Grade 3  when a girl called me stupid face,  she really hurt me,  why’d she call me stupid face?  Is my face stupid?  How’s that even possible?  A person can be stupid  but a face? That’s impossible.  Shit happens all the time  and you learn how to deal with it,  Regular, everday, normal fuckin’ bullshit.  I’m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka…  When I get into a fight I usually leave on a stretcher.  I’m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker…  When I got nothin’ to say I usually talk about the weather.  I’m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka…  I like the 1st Back to the Future but the 2nd one was better.  I’m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker…  I like red peppers better than the green ones.  Ooooohoooooo…savin up my money  To go buy a new dishwasher.  Mine broke about 6 months ago.  Mother fucker.  Go Go Go Go  Go shorty, it’s your birthday,  Go party like it’s your birthday.  I wasn’t invited, but it’s okay.  I’ll just stay at home and play some video games.",

Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games.",

  "LYRICS: You want some more of this, bitch? Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

Back in the heezy We could do this all year long (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face?

That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

  "Jon Lajoie - Everyday Normal Guy 2 - текст песни  Steve: You want some more of this bitch? Back and easy... We could do this all year long I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... I told you in a first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... One night a week, my mom likes to cook me supper I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... And Michael Keaton was my favourite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls are doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly, I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, It worked out great Got on the bus, put on my headphones on and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt and motherfuckin\u0027 Ace of Base Yo what can I say It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning and bed early at night To be productive at work I got to be well rested Yeah motherfucker you heard what I just said I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... I don\u0027t like margarine I much prefer the taste of butter I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... My favorite movies as a kid were superman and ghostbusters I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... And I\u0027m not a huge Nicolas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fuckin\u0027 fire truck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalogue And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song motherfucker I don\u0027t like to admit it Is the Celine Dion song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams I see you I feel you Everytime I hear that fucking shit a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo Dicaprio had to die Though I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones but its the worst that make me cry Like that time in grade three when girl called me stupid face She really hurt me, Why did she called me stupid face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person can be stupid, but a face, that\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fuckin\u0027 bullshit I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... When I get into a fight I usually leave on a stretcher I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... When I\u0027ve got nothing to say I usually talk about the weather I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... I liked the first \"Back to the future\" but the second one was better I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... I like red peppers better than the green ones Ou-ouhh, Savin\u0027 up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about 6 months ago Motherfucker Go Go Go Go Go Charlie It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited but its okay I just stayed at home and played some videogames",

I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don\u0027t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I\u0027m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I\u0027m trying to explain that I\u0027m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn\u0027t lose to anyone.",

Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches they were walkin\u0027 my way \"Yo whatchu girls doin tonight?\" is what I wanted to say but suddenly I panicked my voice started to shake. so I put my head down and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great. Got on the bus put my headphones on and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfuckin Ace of Base. Yo, what can I say, it\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning in bed early at night. To be productive at work I gotta be well rested. Yeah muthafucka, you heard what I just said. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka... I don\u0027t like margarine I much prefer the taste of butter. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka... I have a hard time opening my eyes under water. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... and I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan. I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family, me and my brothers and sisters played hide and seek, I have good memories from my childhood bitch, my favorite toy was my fuckin fire truck bitch, I used to play with that motherfucker all day long, until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog and then I played with my muthafucka all day long about 10 times a day man, all year long. My favorite song motherfucker I don\u0027t like to admit it is a Celine Dion song from the movie Titanic. \"Every night in my dreams, I see you...I feel you...\" Every time I hear that fuckin shit a tear comes to my eye. Why the fuck did Leonardo Di Caprio have to die? Though I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy, sticks and stones break my bones but it\u0027s the words that make me cry. Like that time in Grade 3 when a girl called me stupid face, she really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me stupid face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person can be stupid but a face? That\u0027s impossible. Shit happens all the time and you learn how to deal with it, Regular, everday, normal fuckin\u0027 bullshit. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka... When I get into a fight I usually leave on a stretcher. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... When I got nothin\u0027 to say I usually talk about the weather. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka... I like the 1st Back to the Future but the 2nd one was better. I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... I like red peppers better than the green ones. Ooooohoooooo...savin up my money to go buy a new dishwasher. Mine broke about 6 months ago. Mother fucker. Go Go Go Go Go shorty, it\u0027s your birthday, Go party like it\u0027s your birthday. I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay. I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

Назад у лудницу Back in the heezy Могли бисмо ово да радимо током целе године We could do this all year long Рекао сам ти у првој песми, рећи ћу ти у другој I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (Ја сам само обичан свакодневни нормалан дркаџија) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Ја немам девојку, моја рука је мој једини љубавник I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (Ја сам само обичан свакодневни нормалан дркаџија) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Једно вече у недељи моја мама воли да ми кува вечеру One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (Ја сам само обичан свакодневни нормалан дркаџија) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) А Мајкл Китон је био мој омиљени Бетмен And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman Шетао сам улицом пре неки дан I was walking down the street just the other day Видео сам ове две фине кучке, ходале су мојим путем I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Еј, шта ви девојке радите вечерас?\" \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" је оно што сам хтео да кажем is what I wanted to say Али одједном ме је ухватила паника, глас ми је почео да дрхти But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake Па сам спустио главу и једноставно сам отишао So I put my head down, and I just walked away Ионако сам морао да стигнем на аутобус, одлично је прошао I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Ушао сам у аутобус, ставио слушалице и притиснуо плаи Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Шерил Кроу, Џејмс Блант и јебени Ас Бас Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Хеј, шта да кажем? Yo, what can I say? То је само један дан у мом животу It\u0027s just a day in my life Ујутру рано устајем, увече рано у кревет I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night Да бих био продуктиван на послу, морам да се добро одморим To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Да, дркаџијо, чуо си шта сам управо рекао Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said Не волим маргарин, много више волим укус путера I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (Ја сам само обичан свакодневни нормалан дркаџија) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Моји омиљени филмови као дете су били Супермен и Истеривачи духова My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (Ја сам само обичан свакодневни нормалан дркаџија) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) Тешко отварам очи под водом I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (Ја сам само обичан свакодневни нормалан дркаџија) (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) И нисам велики фан Николаса Кејџа And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan Ја сам из породице ниже средње класе I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Ја и моја браћа и сестре играли смо се жмурке Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek",

  "🧮📚📏📐REGRESO A CLASES PROGRESIVO Y SEGURO 2021-2022📚📏📐 Matematica🧮📏📐 📚Tema Indispensable: Proceso social del trabajo 📚Tema generador: Con alegría retomamos de forma segura a nuestros liceos 🧮Tema 1 NUMEROS NATURALES Y DECIMALES Los números naturales son los que utilizamos en la vida cotidiana para contar u ordenar y pertenecen al conjunto de números enteros positivos. es un número natural, aunque no todos los autores están de acuerdo. Los números naturales no tienen decimal, unidad imaginaria, o bien no son fracciones. Las principales características que definen el conjunto de los números naturales son: +Los números naturales siguen un orden creciente. +La cantidad de números naturales que existe entre dos números naturales es finita. +Siempre existe un número natural mayor (porque la serie es infinita). +Entre un número natural y el siguiente en su serie, no existe ningún número natural. +El uno es el primer número natural. Operaciones con números enteros + La adición cuyo resultado es suma (operación cerrada) + La sustracción cuyo resultado es la resta (operación abierta) + La multiplicación cuyo resultado recibe el nombre de producto (operación cerrada) + La división cuyo resultado es el cociente (operación abierta) + La potenciación cuyo resultado es la potencia. (operación cerrada) + La Radicación cuyo resultado es la raíz. (operación abierta) Operaciones básicas con números naturales: Suma o adición de números naturales Operación interna: La suma de dos números naturales es otro número natural. Propiedad conmutativa: El orden de los sumandos no altera el resultado: a + b \u003d b + a ▪ Ejemplo: 5 + 4 \u003d 4 + 5 Propiedad asociativa: Para sumar tres o más números naturales, el orden en que se haga no modifica el resultado:    a + (b + c) \u003d (a + b) + c ▪ Ejemplo:   2 + (7 + 3) \u003d (2 + 7) + 3 El elemento neutro es el 0: a + 0 \u003d 0 + a ▪ Ejemplo:   6 + 0 \u003d 0 + 6 Resta o sustracción de números naturales Operación no interna: La resta de dos números naturales no siempre es otro número natural. Para que así fuera, el orden tiene que ser número mayor – número menor. ▪ Ejemplo: 6 – 9 no es un número natural porque no tiene sentido quitarle 9 unidades a un conjunto cuando sólo hay 6. No se cumple la propiedad conmutativa: El orden de los factores altera el resultado: a – b ≠ b – a, pues una de esas operaciones no da como resultado un número natural (por la propiedad anterior). ▪ Ejemplo: 12 – 5 ≠ 5 – 12 porque 12 – 5 \u003d 7 mientras que 5 – 12 no se puede hacer. No se cumple la propiedad asociativa: Al restar tres o más números naturales, el orden en que se haga modifica el resultado. ▪ Ejemplo: 10 – (4 – 1) ≠ (10 – 4) – 1 10 – 3 ≠ 6 – 1 7 ≠ 5 No hay elemento neutro: al no darse la propiedad conmutativa, no existe ningún elemento que la satisfaga pero puedes decir que el 0 es el elemento neutro por la derecha, pues a – 0 \u003d a. ▪ Ejemplo: 8 – 0 ≠ 0 – 8 porque 8 – 0 \u003d 8 mientras que 0 – 8 no se puede hacer. Multiplicación o producto de números naturales Operación interna: El producto de dos números naturales es otro número natural. Propiedad conmutativa: El orden de los factores no altera el producto: a · b \u003d b · a ▪ Ejemplo: 5 · 4 \u003d 4 · 5 Propiedad asociativa: Para multiplicar tres o más números naturales, el orden en que se haga no modifica el resultado: a · (b · c) \u003d (a · b) · c ▪ Ejemplo: 6 · (2 · 5) \u003d (6 · 2) · 5 El elemento neutro es el 1: a · 1 \u003d 1 · a ▪ Ejemplo: 12 · 1 \u003d 1 · 12 \u003d 12 Propiedad distributiva: Un factor que multiplica a una suma puedes escribirla como la suma de los productos de dicho factor con los sumandos; es decir, a · (b + c) \u003d a·b + a·c ▪ Ejemplo: 3 · (6 + 2) \u003d 3·6 + 3·2 Factor común: Una suma en la que los sumandos tienen un elemento en común, puedes escribirla como el producto de dicho elemento y la suma de los sumandos sin ese elemento. Es decir; a·b + a·c \u003d a · (b + c) ▪ Ejemplo: 10 + 14 \u003d 2·5 + 2·7 \u003d 2 · (5 + 7) (Observa que extraer factor común es la operación inversa de la propiedad distributiva.) División o cociente de números naturales Operación no interna: La división de dos números naturales no siempre es otro número natural. Para que así fuera, el resto debería ser 0 o lo que es lo mismo, la división exacta. ▪ Ejemplo: El resultado de dividir 1 entre 3 no es un número natural porque la división no es exacta. No se cumple la propiedad conmutativa: El orden de los factores altera el resultado: a : b ≠ b : a. ▪ Ejemplo: 10 monedas divididas en 5 grupos dan como resultado 2 monedas en cada grupo. Sin embargo 5 monedas divididas entre 10 grupos no se puede hacer porque hay más grupos que monedas. No se cumple la propiedad asociativa: Al dividir tres o más números naturales, el orden en que se haga modifica el resultado. ▪ Ejemplo: 24 : (6 : 2) ≠ (24 : 6) : 2                    24 : 3 ≠ 4 : 2                     8 ≠ 2 No hay elemento neutro: al no darse la propiedad conmutativa, no existe ningún elemento que la satisfaga pero puedes decir que el 1 es el elemento neutro por la derecha, pues a : 1 \u003d a. ▪ Ejemplo: 25 : 1 \u003d 25 pero 1 : 25 ≠ 25. NO existe la división entre 0: Dividir entre 0 significaría repartir algo en 0 grupos; al no haber grupos entre los que repartir, no tiene sentido hacer la división. Los números naturales en la vida diaria Puedes utilizarlos para contar: por ejemplo, las personas que asisten a un evento, el dinero recaudado en dicho evento o el beneficio que se ha obtenido al descontar los gastos de la organización. Del mismo modo puedes usarlos para ordenar: los países que más contaminan el medio ambiente, el orden de llegada a la meta en una carrera, la clasificación de un campeonato de fútbol,… También puedes emplearlos para codificar: desde el número de teléfono fijo o móvil, la frecuencia de una emisora de radio hasta el código de barras de un producto. Igualmente puedes hacer uso de ellos para medir: la altura o el peso de una persona, la distancia entre dos ciudades, el tiempo de cocción de un pastel… ¿Se te ocurre algún uso más? Actividades: 1.- Busca el termino desconocido  a. 3456+____\u003d12.421            b. 89678 + 94569\u003d ______    c. _____ + 97865 \u003d 187522 d. 94567 - 3456 \u003d____        e. _____ - 9876 \u003d 78       f. 9321 – 7895 \u003d 2.- Números naturales.  Problema 1 Ainara ha comprado 140 vestidos a 8 Bs. cada uno y los pone en venta a 12 Bs. la unidad. Como no consigue vender 30, los rebaja a 10 Bs., de modo que consigue venderlos todos. ¿Qué beneficio ha obtenido por la venta de los vestidos? Problema 2 El Teatro Lías Bermúdez   tiene un aforo máximo de 300 localidades. El día del estreno de una obra se vendieron la mitad por teléfono y 50 a pie de taquilla. ¿Cuántas entradas quedaron por vender? Si las entradas en taquilla cuestan 12 Bs. y las de venta telefónica 10 Bs. ¿Cuánto dinero habrá recaudado el teatro el día del estreno? Problema 3 Un restaurante tiene 20 docenas de huevos para hacer 10 bizcochos para una tarta de boda y, con los huevos que sobren harán flanes. Para cada bizcocho se emplean 6 huevos y para cada flan 5 huevos. ¿Cuántos flanes podrán hacerse? Problema 4 El llenado de un abrevadero para el ganado se realiza con dos manantiales que dan 2 litros por minuto el primero y 10 litros por hora el segundo. Por un desagüe se pierden 5 litros por día. ¿Qué capacidad tendrá el abrevadero si son necesarias 3 semanas para llenarlo?   Observaciones: el tema lo deben transcribir al cuaderno con títulos y subtítulos subrayados con azul y los signos de puntuación en rojo.  El día de clases presenciales se reforzarán las dudas que tenga el estudiante. Recordemos la importancia de asistir al liceo",

Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

  "LYRICS: You want some more of this, bitch? Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face?

Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games pls like i spend so much time",

Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

  "Lyrics: You want some more of this, bitch? Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

  "¿Quieres más de esto, perra? De vuelta en el heezy Podríamos hacer esto todo el año Te lo dije en la primera canción, te lo diré en otra (solo soy un hijo de puta normal de todos los días) No tengo novia, mi mano es mi único amante (solo soy un hijo de puta normal de todos los días) Una noche a la semana, a mi mamá le gusta cocinarme la cena (soy un hijo de puta normal y corriente) y Michael Keaton era mi Batman favorito. Estaba caminando por la calle el otro día vi a estas dos buenas perras, estaban caminando en mi camino \"Oye, ¿qué hacéis esta noche, chicas?\" es lo que quería decir Pero de repente entré en pánico, mi voz comenzó a temblar Así que bajé la cabeza y me fui. Tenía que tomar un autobús de todos modos, funcionó muy bien. Subí al autobús, me puse los auriculares. y presionó reproducir Sheryl Crow, James Blunt y el maldito Ace of Bass Yo, ¿qué puedo decir? Es solo un día en mi vida Me levanto temprano en la mañana, en la cama temprano en la noche Para ser productivo en el trabajo, tengo que descansar bien Sí, hijo de puta, escuchaste lo que acabo de decir No me gusta la margarina, prefiero el sabor de la mantequilla (solo soy un hijo de puta normal de todos los días) Mis películas favoritas cuando era niño eran Superman y Ghostbusters (solo soy un hijo de puta normal de todos los días) . tiempo abriendo los ojos bajo el agua (solo soy un hijo de puta normal de todos los días) y no soy un gran fan de Nicholas Cage Soy de una familia de clase media baja Mis hermanos y hermanas y yo jugamos al escondite Tengo buenos recuerdos de mi infancia, perra Mi juguete favorito era mi maldito camión de bomberos, perra Solía ​​jugar con ese hijo de puta todo el día Hasta que aprendí sobre sexo en el catálogo de Sears Y luego jugué con mi hijo de puta todo el día Aproximadamente diez veces al día, hombre, durante todo el año Mi canción favorita, hijo de puta, no me gusta admitir que es una canción de Celine Dion de la película Titanic Todas las noches en mis sueños, te veo, te siento Cada vez que escucho esa puta mierda, una lágrima me viene al ojo ¿Por qué diablos Leonardo DiCaprio tuvo que morir? Yo, no tengo miedo de decir que yo soy un chico sensible Los palos y las piedras me rompen los huesos, pero son las palabras las que me hacen llorar Como aquella vez en el tercer grado, cuando una chica me llamó Cara estúpida Ella realmente me lastimó, ¿por qué me llamó Cara estúpida? ¿Mi cara es estúpida? ¿Cómo es eso posible? Una persona puede ser estúpida, pero ¿una cara? Eso es imposible mierda sucede todo el tiempo, y aprender a lidiar con él todos los días normales regular puto de mierda Cuando me meto en una pelea, por lo general me voy en camilla (solo soy un hijo de puta normal de todos los días) Cuando no tengo nada que decir, generalmente hablo sobre el clima (solo soy un hijo de puta normal de todos los días) Me gusta el primer Regreso al futuro, pero el segundo fue mejor (solo soy un hijo de puta normal de todos los días) Me gustan más los pimientos rojos que los verdes Ooh-hoo, ahorrando mi dinero para ir a comprar un nuevo lavaplatos La mía se rompió hace unos seis meses, hijo de puta Ve, ve, ve, ve, ve shawty Es tu cumpleaños Ve a la fiesta como si fuera tu cumpleaños No me invitaron, pero está bien Me quedaré en casa y jugaré algunos videojuegos",

We could do this all year long [Chorus: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman [Verse 1: Jon Lajoie] I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said [Chorus 2: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicolas Cage fan [Verse 2: Jon Lajoie] I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic (Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you) Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say admit that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones But it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three When a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me... Why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face, that\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit [Chorus 3: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back to the Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones [Verse 3: Jon Lajoie] Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago... Motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shorty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home, and play some video games [Outro: Steve] You want some of this, come and get it",

I think the problem somehow is that today kinda everyone has access to the internet everywhere all day long. Back in the days the ppl online spent a certain amount of time there to have a nice time. Today the ppl are somehow to lazy to use the internet to entertain themselves, like searching for content on youtube etc.  instead \"everyone\" is camping infront of smartphones screens getting triggered and complaining about others ppl\u0027s opinions. I think that ones goes to Apple and Phone Companys for giving everyone access to the internet everywhere by making smartphones affordable. Sorry for my english :)",

Back in the heezy We could do this all year long (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the f*ck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

We could do this all year long [Chorus: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman [Verse 1: Jon Lajoie] I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said [Chorus 2: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicolas Cage fan [Verse 2: Jon Lajoie] I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic (Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you) Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say admit that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones But it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three When a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me... Why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face, that\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit [Chorus 3: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back to the Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones [Verse 3: Jon Lajoie] Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago... Motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shorty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home, and play some video games [Outro: Steve] You want some of this, come and get it",

That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

Back in the heezy We could do this all year long I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

We could do this all year long [Chorus: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman [Verse 1: Jon Lajoie] I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said [Chorus 2: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicolas Cage fan [Verse 2: Jon Lajoie] I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic (Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you) Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say admit that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones But it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three When a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me... Why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face, that\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit [Chorus 3: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back to the Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones [Verse 3: Jon Lajoie] Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago... Motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shorty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home, and play some video games [Outro: Steve] You want some of this, come and get it",

One night a week, my mom likes to cook me supper I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... And Michael Keaton was my favourite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls are doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly, I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, It worked out great Got on the bus, put on my headphones on and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt and motherfuckin\u0027 Ace of Base Yo what can I say It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning and bed early at night To be productive at work I got to be well rested Yeah motherfucker you heard what I just said I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker...

  "[Intro: Steve] You want some more of this, bitch? Back in the heezy... We could do this all year long [Chorus: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman [Verse 1: Jon Lajoie] I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said [Chorus 2: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicolas Cage fan [Verse 2: Jon Lajoie] I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic (Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you) Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say admit that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones But it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three When a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me... Why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face, that\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit [Chorus 3: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back to the Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones [Verse 3: Jon Lajoie] Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago... Motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shorty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home, and play some video games [Outro: Steve] You want some of this, come and get it",

I have no idea Lyrics: I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones, but it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three, when a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me, why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face? That\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back To The Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago, motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

The rhymes are absolutely amazing and the flow of the song is amazing. This man could be my friend. He\u0027s the equivalent of a man to be there when you need since he can share most events. He is wise in the matter. From a man to a man, I can relate my life to this man. 100%. He was 28 when he made this song and he\u0027s 40 now. That really shows how we devolved when I can relate to a 28 years old. I\u0027m only a teenager. That\u0027s my opinion. Thanks for this song JonLajoie",

  "Intro: Steve] You want some more of this, bitch? Back in the heezy... We could do this all year long [Chorus: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman [Verse 1: Jon Lajoie] I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said [Chorus 2: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicolas Cage fan [Verse 2: Jon Lajoie] I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic (Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you) Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say admit that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones But it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three When a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me... Why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face, that\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit [Chorus 3: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back to the Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones [Verse 3: Jon Lajoie] Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago... Motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shorty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home, and play some video games [Outro: Steve] You want some of this, come and get it",

  "Ты хочешь ещё, сучка? Снова в строю… Мы могли сделать это в любой момент Я самый обычный сукин сын Я говорил тебе в первой песне, скажу и в этой Я самый обычный сукин сын У меня нет девушки, моя рука – моя единственная любовница Я самый обычный сукин сын Раз в неделю мама любит готовить мне ужин Я самый обычный сукин сын И Майкл Китон – мой любимый Бэтмен Как-то раз я шел по улице И увидел двух симпатичных сучек, они шли мне навстречу Я хотел сказать «Йоу, что вы делаете сегодня вечером?» Но внезапно запаниковал, мой голос начал дрожать Так что я опустил голову и прошел мимо Повезло, что мне в любом случае нужен был автобус Сел в автобус, нацепил наушники и нажал «play» Шэрил Кроу, Джеймс Блант и чёртовы Ace of Base Йоу, что я могу сказать? Это просто один день из моей жизни Я просыпаюсь рано утром, ложусь спать рано вечером Чтобы быть работоспособным, мне нужно хорошо высыпаться Да, мазафака, ты слышал, что я сказал Я самый обычный сукин сын Не люблю маргарин, предпочитаю вкус масла Я самый обычный сукин сын Моими любимыми фильмами в детстве были «Супермен» и «Охотники за привидениями» Я самый обычный сукин сын Мне тяжело открывать глаза под водой Я самый обычный сукин сын И я не большой поклонник Николаса Кейджа Я из скромной семьи среднего класса Мы с братьями и сестрами играли в прятки У меня хорошие детские воспоминания, сука Моей любимой игрушкой была чертова пожарная машина, сука Я играл с этой херовиной днями напролет Пока не узнал о сексе из каталога «Sears»1 И тогда я начал играть днями напролет со своей херовиной Раз десять за день, чувак, годами напролет Моя любимая песня, черт, я не люблю это признавать Это песня Селин Дион из «Титаника» (Каждую ночь, в своих снах, я вижу тебя, я чувствую тебя)2 Каждый раз, когда я слышу это дерьмо, слезы выступают на глазах За каким хером Леонардо ДиКаприо должен был умереть? Йоу, я не боюсь признать, что я чувствительный парень Палки и камни могут сломать мои кости, Но только слова могут заставить меня плакать Как в тот раз, в третьем классе Когда девочка назвала меня тупорылым Мне было больно... Почему она назвала меня тупорылым? Неужели моё лицо тупое? Как это вообще возможно? Человек может быть тупым, но лицо? Это невозможно Дерьмо случается постоянно, и ты учишься с этим разбираться Самое обычное ежедневное дерьмо! Я самый обычный сукин сын Каждый раз, когда я дерусь, меня выносят на носилках Я самый обычный сукин сын Когда мне нечего сказать, я обычно говорю о погоде Я самый обычный сукин сын Мне нравится первый «Назад в будущее», но второй был лучше Я самый обычный сукин сын Красный перец мне нравится больше, чем зеленый Уу-хуу, скопил денег, чтобы купить новую посудомойку Моя сломалась месяцев шесть назад… мазафака Давай, давай, малышка Это твой день рождения Развлекайся будто это твой день рождения Меня не пригласили, но всё в порядке Я просто останусь дома и немного поиграю в видеоигры Автор перевода — SRQ Оригинал:  Copyright:  ©",

It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said [Chorus 2: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicolas Cage fan [Verse 2: Jon Lajoie] I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me any my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic (Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you) Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say admit that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones But it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three When a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me... Why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face, that\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit [Chorus 3: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back to the Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones [Verse 3: Jon Lajoie] Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago... Motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home, and play some video games [Outro: Steve] You want some of this, come and get it",

And I\u0027m not a huge Nicolas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower middle class family Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fuckin\u0027 fire truck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalogue and then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song motherfucker I don\u0027t like to admit it Is the Celine Dion song from the movie Titanic Every night in my dreams I see you I feel you Everytime I hear that fucking shit a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo Dicaprio had to die Though I\u0027m not afraid to say that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones but its the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three when girl called me stupid face She really hurt me, Why did she called me stupid face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person can be stupid, but a face, that\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fuckin\u0027 bullshit I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... When I get into a fight I usually leave on a stretcher I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... When I\u0027ve got nothing to say I usually talk about the weather I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... I liked the first \"Back to the future\" but the second one was better I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker... I like red peppers better than the green ones Ou-ouhh, savin\u0027 up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about 6 months ago Motherfucker Go Go Go Go Go Shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited but its okay I\u0027ll just stay at home and play some video games",

  "[Intro: Steve] You want some more of this, bitch? Back in the heezy... We could do this all year long [Chorus: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman [Verse 1: Jon Lajoie] I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said [Chorus 2: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicolas Cage fan [Verse 2: Jon Lajoie] I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me any my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic (Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you) Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to say admit that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones But it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three When a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me... Why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face, that\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit [Chorus 3: Jon Lajoie] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back to the Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones [Verse 3: Jon Lajoie] Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago... Motherfucker Go, go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home, and play some video games [Outro: Steve] You want some of this, come and get it",

We could do this all year long [Jon Lajoie] [Hook] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman [Verse 1] I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said [Hook] (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan [Verse 2] I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me any my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic (\"Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you\") Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to admit that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones But it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three When a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me...

  "Незачто) Ты хочешь ещё, сучка? Снова в строю… Мы могли сделать это в любой момент Я самый обычный сукин сын Я говорил тебе в первой песне, скажу и в этой Я самый обычный сукин сын У меня нет девушки, моя рука – моя единственная любовница Я самый обычный сукин сын Раз в неделю мама любит готовить мне ужин Я самый обычный сукин сын И Майкл Китон – мой любимый Бэтмен Как-то раз я шел по улице И увидел двух симпатичных сучек, они шли мне навстречу Я хотел сказать «Йоу, что вы делаете сегодня вечером?» Но внезапно запаниковал, мой голос начал дрожать Так что я опустил голову и прошел мимо Повезло, что мне в любом случае нужен был автобус Сел в автобус, нацепил наушники и нажал «play» Шэрил Кроу, Джеймс Блант и чёртовы Ace of Base Йоу, что я могу сказать? Это просто один день из моей жизни Я просыпаюсь рано утром, ложусь спать рано вечером Чтобы быть работоспособным, мне нужно хорошо высыпаться Да, мазафака, ты слышал, что я сказал Я самый обычный сукин сын Не люблю маргарин, предпочитаю вкус масла Я самый обычный сукин сын Моими любимыми фильмами в детстве был «Супермен» и «Охотники за привидениями» Я самый обычный сукин сын Мне тяжело открывать глаза под водой Я самый обычный сукин сын И я не большой поклонник Николаса Кейджа Я из скромной семьи среднего класса Мы с братьями и сестрами играли в прятки У меня хорошие детские воспоминания, сука Моей любимой игрушкой была моя чертова пожарная машина, сука Я играл с этой херовиной днями напролет Пока не узнал о сексе из каталога «Sears»1 И тогда я начал играть днями напролет со своей херовиной Раз десять за день, чувак, годами напролет Моя любимая песня, черт, я не люблю это признавать Это песня Селин Дион из «Титаника» (Каждую ночь, в своих снах, я вижу тебя, я чувствую тебя)2 Каждый раз, когда я слышу это дерьмо, слезы выступают на глазах За каким хером Леонардо ДиКаприо должен был умереть? Йоу, я не боюсь признать, что я чувствительный парень Палки и камни могут сломать мои кости, Но только слова могут заставить меня плакать Как в тот раз, в третьем классе Когда девочка называла меня тупорылым Неужели моё лицо тупое? Как это вообще возможно? Человек может быть тупым, но лицо? Это невозможно Дерьмо случается постоянно, и ты учишься с этим разбираться Самое обычное ежедневное дерьмо! Я самый обычный сукин сын Каждый раз, когда я дерусь, меня выносят на носилках Я самый обычный сукин сын Когда мне нечего сказать, я обычно говорю о погоде Я самый обычный сукин сын Мне нравится первый «Назад в будущее», но второй был лучше Я самый обычный сукин сын Красный перец мне нравится больше, чем зеленый Уу-хуу, скопил денег, чтобы купить новую посудомойку Моя сломалась месяцев шесть назад… мазафака Давай, давай, малышка Это твой день рождения Развлекайся будто это твой день рождения Меня не пригласили, но всё в порядке Я просто останусь дома и немного поиграю в видеоигры",

  "Tekst piosenki: Steve: You want some more of this bitch? Back in the heezy. We can do this all year long. I’m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka… I told you in the first song, I’ll tell you in another. I’m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker… I don’t have a girlfriend my hand’s my only lover. I’m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka… One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper. I’m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker… And Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman. I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches they were walkin’ my way “Yo whatchu girls doin tonight?” is what I wanted to say but suddenly I panicked my voice started to shake. so I put my head down and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great. Got on the bus put my headphones on and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfuckin Ace of Base. Yo, what can I say, it’s just a day in my life I’m up early in the morning in bed early at night. To be productive at work I gotta be well rested. Yeah muthafucka, you heard what I just said. I’m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka… I don’t like margarine I much prefer the taste of butter. I’m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker… My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters. I’m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka… I have a hard time opening my eyes under water. I’m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker… and I’m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan. I’m from a lower-middle class family, me and my brothers and sisters played hide and seek, I have good memories from my childhood bitch, my favorite toy was my fuckin fire truck bitch, I used to play with that motherfucker all day long, until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog and then I played with my muthafucka all day long about 10 times a day man, all year long. My favorite song motherfucker I don’t like to admit it is a Celine Dion song from the movie Titanic. “Every night in my dreams, I see you…I feel you…” Every time I hear that fuckin shit a tear comes to my eye. Why the fuck did Leonardo Di Caprio have to die? Though I’m not afraid to say that I’m a sensitive guy, sticks and stones break my bones but it’s the words that make me cry. Like that time in Grade 3 when a girl called me stupid face, she really hurt me, why’d she call me stupid face? Is my face stupid? How’s that even possible? A person can be stupid but a face? That’s impossible. Shit happens all the time and you learn how to deal with it, Regular, everday, normal fuckin’ bullshit. I’m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka… When I get into a fight I usually leave on a stretcher. I’m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker… When I got nothin’ to say I usually talk about the weather. I’m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka… I like the 1st Back to the Future but the 2nd one was better. I’m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker… I like red peppers better than the green ones. Ooooohoooooo…savin up my money to go buy a new dishwasher. Mine broke about 6 months ago. Mother fucker. Go Go Go Go Go shorty, it’s your birthday, Go party like it’s your birthday. I wasn’t invited, but it’s okay. I’ll just stay at home and play some video games. Steve: You want some of this? Come and get it.",

  "(I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I told you in the first song, I\u0027ll tell you in another (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t have a girlfriend, my hand\u0027s my only lover (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) One night a week my mom likes to cook me supper (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way \"Yo, what you girls doing tonight?\" is what I wanted to say But suddenly I panicked, my voice started to shake So I put my head down, I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfucking Ace of Bass Yo, what can I say? It\u0027s just a day in my life I\u0027m up early in the morning, in bed early at night To be productive at work, I got to be well rested Yeah, motherfucker, you heard what I just said (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I don\u0027t like margarine, I much prefer the taste of butter (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) And I\u0027m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan I\u0027m from a lower-middle class family Me any my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek I have good memories from my childhood, bitch My favorite toy was my fucking firetruck, bitch I used to play with that motherfucker all day long Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog And then I played with my motherfucker all day long About ten times a day, man, all year long My favorite song, motherfucker, I don\u0027t like to admit it Is a Celine Dion Song from the movie Titanic (\"Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you\") Every time I hear that fucking shit, a tear comes to my eye Why the fuck did Leonardo DiCaprio have to die Yo, I\u0027m not afraid to admit that I\u0027m a sensitive guy Sticks and stones break my bones But it\u0027s the words that make me cry Like that time in grade three When a girl called me Stupid Face She really hurt me... Why\u0027d she call me Stupid Face? Is my face stupid? How\u0027s that even possible? A person could be stupid, but a face, that\u0027s impossible Shit happens all the time, and you learn how to deal with it Regular everyday normal fucking bullshit (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I get into a fight, I usually leave on a stretcher (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) When I got nothing to say, I usually talk about the weather (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like the first Back to the Future, but the second one was better (I\u0027m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker) I like red peppers better than the green ones Ooh-hoo, saving up my money to go buy a new dishwasher Mine broke about six months ago... Motherfucker Go, go, go, go shawty It\u0027s your birthday Go party like it\u0027s your birthday I wasn\u0027t invited, but it\u0027s okay I\u0027ll just stay at home, and play some video games",

I was walking down the street just the other day I saw these two fine bitches they were walkin’ my way “Yo whatchu girls doin tonight?” is what I wanted to say but suddenly I panicked my voice started to shake. so I put my head down and I just walked away I had a bus to catch anyway, it worked out great. Got on the bus put my headphones on and pressed play Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, and motherfuckin Ace of Base. Yo, what can I say, it’s just a day in my life I’m up early in the morning in bed early at night. To be productive at work I gotta be well rested. Yeah muthafucka, you heard what I just said. I’m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka… I don’t like margarine I much prefer the taste of butter. I’m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker… My favorite movies as a kid were Superman and Ghostbusters. I’m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka… I have a hard time opening my eyes under water. I’m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker… and I’m not a huge Nicholas Cage fan. I’m from a lower-middle class family, me and my brothers and sisters played hide and seek, I have good memories from my childhood bitch, my favorite toy was my fuckin fire truck bitch, I used to play with that motherfucker all day long, until I learned about sex from the Sears catalog and then I played with my muthafucka all day long about 10 times a day man, all year long. My favorite song motherfucker I don’t like to admit it is a Celine Dion song from the movie Titanic. “Every night in my dreams, I see you…I feel you…” Every time I hear that fuckin shit a tear comes to my eye. Why the fuck did Leonardo Di Caprio have to die? Though I’m not afraid to say that I’m a sensitive guy, sticks and stones break my bones but it’s the words that make me cry. Like that time in Grade 3 when a girl called me stupid face, she really hurt me, why’d she call me stupid face? Is my face stupid? How’s that even possible? A person can be stupid but a face? That’s impossible. Shit happens all the time and you learn how to deal with it, Regular, everday, normal fuckin’ bullshit. I’m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka… When I get into a fight I usually leave on a stretcher. I’m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker… When I got nothin’ to say I usually talk about the weather. I’m just a regular everyday normal muthafucka… I like the 1st Back to the Future but the 2nd one was better. I’m just a regular everyday normal motherfucker… I like red peppers better than the green ones. Ooooohoooooo…savin up my money to go buy a new dishwasher. Mine broke about 6 months ago. Mother fucker. Go Go Go Go Go shorty, it’s your birthday, Go party like it’s your birthday. I wasn’t invited, but it’s okay. I’ll",

  "So got damn good.",
  "yeah even alternative hip hop has became cliched at this point.  that\u0027s why i generally keep it old school.",
  "i love it. respect to this dude.",
  "i have nothing really left to say other than you must be somewhat easily impressed comedywise if you really think this is SUCH good comedy on all the aforementioned levels.  i just don\u0027t find it very funny, and am sick of white people doing rap parodies (so i am obviously somewhat biased). i will at least say that this is one of the better rap parodies i\u0027ve seen. i just find them as awkward to listen to (white people generally lack rhythm and flow) as my parents talking about sex.",
  "as for \"everyday white guy\" rap, denny \"blazin\" hazen, the average homeboy, was hilarious because he thought people would take him seriously, and nobody really needed to expand on it.  no parody was needed.",
  "see you\u0027re generalizing about hip hop.  there is soooo much better shit out there you jsut have to put a little effort in.  remember q-tip from a few years ago?  look for his 2nd album, kamaal the abstract, complete 180 turn around artistically.  as for those links, i really don\u0027t keep track of piss poor comedy, but if you insist.",
  "This is as good as parody gets, its awesome.",
  "Great video! and that sweater is form winners! they were out of my size \u003d(",

  "wow",
  "AweSome!",
  "pure brilliance. better than the first one methinks, made me laugh out loud more. Also, yet again, some things resonate. Won\u0027t say what... awesome nyway.",
  "oh yeah Montreal Canadiens FTW!!",
  "for the record i think average homeboy is the best rap parody ever.  which is INSANE considering he was GOD DAMN SERIOUS the whole time.",
  "I just felt like calling someone a mook. You are a mook too Boston. haha, but ya good video all in all, better than I could do.",
  "aight i can live with that.",
  "haha, pretty much my overall point.  extra points for using \"mook\" in a sentence.",
  "You are a MOOK! beat it. funny like 5 years ago maybe.",
  "if you\u0027re not adding to the genre you\u0027re just repeating the same stuff over and over.",
  "also remember scary movie 3 (i think it was 3) where they did the 8 mile parody?  funny, but what more can really be said?",
  "i didn\u0027t miss any satire and neither did the HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO ALREADY DID THIS.  you seem to be missing that main point of mine.  the most credit i\u0027m going to give him is for compiling the best of white guy rap parodies.  malibu\u0027s most wanted was pretty funny but does anybody else other than jamie kennedy need to be doing this mildly funny genre (see i\u0027m not just taking shots at lajoie)?",
  "also i don\u0027t appreciate the random dig at my intelligence level in this otherwise civil comedic debate, i am a student of comedy in a generation of assholes who think jackass and viva la bam are cutting edge hilarity, so how about working with me on this?",
  "i think you\u0027re overselling this as \"high-brow\" comedy.  george carlin has been doing observational comedy for years, what is so revolutionary about this? also, what if some new comedian took to the stage today and went, \"hey did you know there are 7 words you can\u0027t say on television?\" as if he were the first to do so?  and then what if he went \"man, rapping isn\u0027t hard, listen to me, i\u0027m amazing WIGGEDY WIGGEDY RAP RAP RAPPITY RAP RAP!\"",
  "Fantastic, I love the bit about Titanic, haha!",
  "i think it\u0027s understood he\u0027s jokes, but i am not impressed with those jokes.  there is nothing i dont\u0027 \"get\" about this video, in fact, i\u0027ve done my own rap parodies, a lot of us have done this growing up in the 90\u0027s and since, but even when i was in high school, i KNOW i was not being original and only mildly funny, and i am a pretty entertaining guy, as i\u0027m sure lajoie is, it\u0027s just that poeple need to realize when a joke is DEAD.",
  "now you see, you\u0027re generalizing mainstream rap to account for all rap, which means you are clearly not familiar with underground hip hop but that\u0027s a bit beside the point so i won\u0027t get into that.  i understand what he\u0027s doing is actually somewhat clever, but it\u0027s really not groundbreaking in any form.  i\u0027m just sick of white people do rap video parodies.  not to say i\u0027m not sick of commercial rap, but come onnnnnnnnnnn, do you really see anything special in this?  done to death.",
  "this video either needs to be funnier or he has to bring some actual skills.  and don\u0027t give me all this layers of revelations about the human condition. blah blah blah, he\u0027s clearly trying to be funny.  i\u0027m sure he can edit, write and act, but he cannot rap.",
  "the main thing i\u0027m disgusted by is his ability to rap.  many many many white people think that it\u0027s hilarious to do a rap parody video, which this is, in it\u0027s basic premise, which is that most rap videos have rappers boasting about how much bigger than life they are.  he is saying how he\u0027s just a normal everyday guy.  it\u0027s been done.  take a look around the internet.  it\u0027s a good premise, but it is PAINFUL to listen to, because he is incredibly white.  sure, that\u0027s the joke, but it\u0027s BEEN DONE.",
  "sorry this comment isn\u0027t for jonlajoie. It\u0027s for SkeksisRule. Apologies for my poor posting skills. I really like this vid, just not SkeksisRule\u0027s comment.",
  "wooow...you\u0027re not racist at all.  obviously you know nothing about where how and why rap orginated in the first place. go educate yourself so your ignorance doesn\u0027t make another appearance. Thanks.",

  "\"I dont got a girlfriend, my hands my only lover\" hahahahahaha",
  "no, see my other comment \"ah ha ha.\" compared to \"OMG I LOVE THIS\" and \"HAHAHA\" my comment is pretty creative. Plus what do you do in your spare time besides bash youtube comments? plus the second back to the future did suck.",
