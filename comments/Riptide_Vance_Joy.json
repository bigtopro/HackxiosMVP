At such a young age, i’d contemplate my future, stressing if i’d even wake up tomorrow- and if i did, what about the day after that? So scared, yet this song secured my mind. I’m still young. I’m in college now, i’ll be 20 next year. I actually drive the same 4runner too. Instead of worrying about falling asleep, I just try my best to wake up. I have an amazing girlfriend of almost 3 years that I love, and I’ll be dammed if i don’t wake up for her.",

Os herbivoros vêm,começando a postar e os predadores logo vão chegar. É uma teia,uma teia alimentar,no pequeno mundo onde tu vai gritar. (Plantinhas,insetos,tudo a interagir,na natureza a vida expandir (Verso 2)  As minhocas no chão,fazem festa decompondo tudo,e na vida que se manifesta, os fungos ajudam,tudo a se reciclar dessa teia pequena,tudo vai se conectar É uma teia,uma teia alimentar,no pequeno mundo onde tu vai gritar.

It\u0027s called a rip current The reason why there\u0027s no such thing as a rip tide is because whether it is high tide or low tide the occurrence still happens although it does pull out harder on the outgoing tide low tide There\u0027s also no such thing as a undertow which is another commonly wrong word used because the current doesn\u0027t pull you under the water just out Rip current is the correct word and YouTube rip currents to see further information that could save you or somebody else\u0027s life Hundreds of people die every year around the world in rip currents",

  "Every Friday me and my brother went out to eat after school even if things weren’t always going great and this song would play in his playlist often in the car. We didn’t always agree on everything and we are different thought I caught on to some of his habits lol. Living with him was frustrating at times but he was there when I needed him. We went fishing, went out with friends, played sports with him, went to the gym with him,  and went to see marvel and DC movies with him. He just got married today and is moving away. I know I’m still gonna see him, but those moments of spending time with him like we used to might be coming to an end. I wish him the best and I hope he lives out his married life happily.",

Listening to this song in the background while playing RDR2 alone, being in the [xbox] party with him and his buddies that yell at me for just speaking a word. This is ongoing as of right now, I’m taking a break. This song makes me think of the good times…  A wise man once said”the past is the past and you can reflect from it, but don’t worry, the future is the future and you can’t always make the choices, don’t worry. The present is now, right now, it really makes it a gift.”",

  "@@stultuskol I dont get how your comment makes any sense to the context of the situation.  1 you cannot assume everyone who like naruto are narutards, liking the lion king doesn\u0027t make you a liontard does it? 2 I said nothing about naruto and I dont bring it to conversation when it isn\u0027t relevant like you just did, maybe its you who is secretly a narutard? If you wanted to talk about naruto then just ask 3  I dont get why cant I like naruto and still be against something that I find gross. Just because I love naruto doesnt mean I agree with everything besides it never shows suicide or depression as a good thing. I never said depression itself is useless, gross and stuff, having depression was a common thing like sasuke (being my Comfort character) who is the most depressed and life hating guy I know yet I still love him and dont find him gross, there is one thing that makes me say that depression is gross.. WHEN PEOPLE SELF HARM OR TAKE THEIR LIFE AWAY Now taking their life away is quite fine since they want it so they should do it but self harm is something nowadays people make out a trend that people need to see and they draw it and show it off like its something to be proud of and not ashamed of. There is no self harm in naruto, not counting some people smoking cigarettes or sasuke making decisions that harm his emotional state like self destructive behaviour but that really isn\u0027t the type of self harm I despise.  I seriously don\u0027t get where did the whole naruto thing came from but I can talk about naruto for hours and explain why that shit aint gross comapre to real life where people treat self harm as something normal nowadays and draw it on their own art and characters for fucks sake.",

A black belt in taekwondo, a singer, an incredible artist, and planned to go into the military. She sang this song for me on her ukelele. But for some reason I couldn\u0027t bring myself to like her back. I don\u0027t know why. It was so disappointing. I thought maybe I could find someone I truly loved, but there was no spark for me. I had fun, but we lived 2 hours away from each other. We spent 2 days total together and texted a good amount. She left for basic training and I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m going to write her while she\u0027s there. Would I be leading her on? This song is melancholy to me, and yet I love it so much. It reminds me of that ship that passed by me in the night that for some unfortunate reason, I didn\u0027t have the inclination to reciprocate any feelings of affection for.",

  "Hey YouTubers.. I need help.  This probably sounds really childish, but I’ve had a crush on this one boy for five years!! I’ve been in the same class for elementary for four years, even online, and we even kind of hung out during online classes. This last year, seventh grade, we were put in different “teams”, which are basically clots of classes to spread all the students out because we had a thousand students for only two grades. Anyways, we both went to band together. But.. he was in the other period. So I really only saw him passing in the halls, band concerts, or waiting for my friends after school. Great. And the story gets worse. I moved out of state this summer. But I got his number from my amazing best friend who literally knows the whole school. Anyways he barely checks his phone, and idk. I just wanna know what YALL think I should say. I am going back to my original state I was born in im five years, so he might still be there. This song just reminded me of him.. I’m being an over dramatic cotton ball.",

It was like everything was gone. And that\u0027s what broke my heart.  I tried to repair our friendship after fight, but they were so against it that it was obvious they didn\u0027t want that anymore.  Now I have a good relationship with them, we smile and talk sometimes like normal classmates do. And that\u0027s good enough.

  "1:05 after much research I have concluded that the movie he spoke about in the song was the movie “Midnight cowboy” the description of movie is :” Convinced of his irresistible appeal to women, Texas dishwasher Joe Buck (Jon Voight) quits his job and heads for New York City, thinking he\u0027ll latch on to some rich dowager. New York, however, is not as hospitable as he imagined, and Joe soon finds himself living in an abandoned building with a Dickensian layabout named Enrico \"Ratso\" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). The two form a rough alliance, and together they kick-start Joe\u0027s hustling career just as Ratso\u0027s health begins to deteriorate”.-google   But I don’t know for sure if it is the movie cause It haven’t been confirmed Update : his has been confirmed it is midnight cowboy",

The streetlights glow a warm orange and you hear the quiet noises of cars driving down the road beside your house.

If you like this music, then listen to the music. Songs like these are a pleasure reserved for those that can feel with it",
  "@@petriecrazy7712 I love most music, but some just hits differently, so I listen to it more. Songs like these make me remember my childhood and how close I used to be to some people. It gives me a sense of nostalgia and makes me feel hurt in a way that lets me know I can still understand the music I also listen to music like _Good Time by Niko Moon_ because it promotes being happy, and its beat isn\u0027t all that bad. Rap never was my style, but I respect those who can, because I can\u0027t do so myself. It\u0027s a wonderful thing to be able to feel music. That\u0027s something that I can say with 100% certainty",
  "@@InternalChickens thank you for giving me a different view of music. I listen to music for beats and nostalgia. But lyrics were never one of them.

And then we went to the playground and went on top of a spider web kinda thingy. There wall like a plastic ball there that people could sit in. 5 people got in that ball. Idk how, it’s small, approximately you could sit in it criss cross and maybe you’ll fit, one person. We did 5 people, not 1. So me and my friends are sitting there and then we decided to have a concert, in the ball, 7 grade. We sang this song god knows how many times. Practically a karaoke cause nobody knew any other song that the whole group knew. So this on repet, maybe 30min. It was great! We had fun. The moral of this story? Have a karaoke with your friends at the playground, or wherever. I promise it’s worth it!",

Just because you do not have depression doesn’t mean everybody else doesn’t. Because that’s very rude. How do you know if they really have it. You don’t. So you should keep your mouth shut either way. Words are hurtful even when they have depression. But how should you know? You don’t know what it feels like. So I’m asking politely please do not be rude to others. You don’t know them.",

Warm, joyful, and....kind of a sweet pain that I want to cry  The thing is that I had a huge crush on my best friend. We had this stereotypical friend relationship when we were just fooling around and teasing each other most of time but really cared on the inside and showed it when needed. Everytime I thought about him I turned on my phone and hummed this song to myself. This song and just thought of his stupid little smile made me all giddy and joyful. When I finally found out about my feelings, after school I gave him note that said: “You’re an idiot. Wanna be my idiot?” and run away.  And he texted me: “yeah, I’ll be ur idiot” I was really happy for whole month, but I still was a little unsure, cause his acceptance was kind of blurry. So when I asked him if we do have real relationship on now, he answered: “Um, no? Not really. I think we’re just super close friends” I was so upset and lost and felt so, SO stupid that I didn’t talk to him for half-an-year so I couldn’t listen to this song without bursting into tears I apologized to him today about my stupid actions, and we are still friends....but I feel so bitter about it. Now I’m listening to this song again, sobbing happily, understanding that I’m still just a stupid little teenage",

  "Same I am very sentimental to objects now just imagine humans, people, family, best friends when I would see my friends hanging out I would start to bawl my eyes out quietly. One time I was on ft with 2 of my other friends and they were making plans and I felt like saying something because I don’t like confrontation and I can’t imagine how they would react. If they reacted badly, I could not imagine losing them. I met one this school year but I‘be known the other one since 2nd grade. We were awkward but it was a funny awkward now that we look back on it. At daycare, she would hang out with the “bad girls” and I only hung out with 2 girls most of the time, tho one of them only went on Thursdays and fridays and she was my best friend. Once the 2 bad girls left it left my friend.  She hung out with one of the girls I would hang out with so I hung out with my best friend. Afterwards the other girl and my best friend started to fight regularly not bad fights just like who’s turn was it playing “all around the world” so me and my friend would step away. Then my best friend left. So did the other girl. But when the other girl left was last year. At the beginning of this school year it was only my friend that I was on ft with and me. Obviously not in the daycare but as our closest friends. She did something that hurt me so I told her not to talk to me. I could stay mad at her for long bc she did become my best friend. When my new friends left and so did the girl that she started hanging out with (the girl she was hanging out with was a girl she made me stop hanging out with) and I went up to her and started throwing a ball up into the tree with her. We tried to get it stuck up there but it didn’t work. She was always there for me. Even if she isn’t super close with me anymore I can’t imagine losing her. She was there on my 8th 9th 10th 11th and 12th birthday. She was there when I was crying bc I didn’t want to leave elementary. She hugged me and I won’t forget the words she told me when she found me crying on the ground the days before the last day of school. She told me “don’t cry. Don’t cry. It’s going to be ok” and it really was. I miss her since she moved about half an hour away and my parents don’t really like to let me have sleepovers. Sorry I just need someone to tell this to. Like I said I hate confrontation and I hate talking unless i fell like it’s the right thing to do. For example standing up to sexist ppl I could do that just to friends in a “hi I don’t want to be ur friend anymore” type of way and when I did that to her I was crying myself to sleep for 2 weeks until I decided to be friends with her again after my brother kind of gave me a little talk about friendships granted he isn’t the best about friendship advice. He has friends that have a ton of common with him. So when they bc distanced it’s bc neither of them really cared too much. She might not be as close but sometimes I consider her my best friend and when I cry I sometimes like to picture or imagine her hugging me telling me not to cry and that it’s going to be ok. Ik some parts can be confusing to my story but trust me it took about half an hour to write it so my apologies.",

  "Alright now picture this. You\u0027re waltzing through the back alleyways after just getting off a late shift. The subtle pungent smell of garbage and rat piss engulfs your nostrils with each stride you take, the cold breeze would nip at your exposed arms with rile up goosebumps to match. It\u0027s always been a long peaceful walk home taking the back ways of the city, never once had you ever   encountered a tainted exposure beside the few drunk on goers and the reliable drunk hobo who would thrust himself against the cracked brick walls, other than the mere few mishaps. It was nothing compared to what\u0027s about to come your way. Whilst continuing to pace each step of yours you hear an unpleasant whistle coming from behind you. It\u0027s nothing much to send your body into an overdrive of concern or worry, as it\u0027s normal for the occasional drunk to get a bit frisky with his emotions. But this however sends an awful off vibe to you, not wanting to give that away you put a little bit more emphasis in your step. It doesnt take long for the eerie figure behind you to pick up the pace of their own, what went from being an undisputed walk amongst what was a supposed drunk and a late worker, turned into a marathon sprint between the two. Your hollered out screams and pleads for help echoed continuously throughout the alleys, all while the person detaining and pinning you down maliciously dragged a blade over your bear throat, blood coating the blade with the vibrations of your scream painting the near end of it as well. All while a whisper like toned sang out this very song to you in breathy  patches while you died right in their very hands.",
