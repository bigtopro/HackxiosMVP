  "Lyrics [Intro: Kanye West \u0026 Jeezy] La, la, la-la (Yeah) Wait till I get my money right [Verse 1: Kanye West] I had a dream I could buy my way to Heaven When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace I told God I\u0027d be back in a second Man, it\u0027s so hard not to act reckless To whom much is given, much is tested Get arrested, guess until he get the message I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny And what I do? Act more stupidly Bought more jewelry, more Louis V My mama couldn\u0027t get through to me The drama, people suing me I\u0027m on TV talking like it\u0027s just you and me I\u0027m just saying how I feel, man I ain\u0027t one of the Cosby\u0027s, I ain\u0027t go to Hillman I guess the money should\u0027ve changed him I guess I should\u0027ve forgot where I came from [Chorus: Kanye West \u0026 Jeezy] La, la, la-la (Ayy!) Wait till I get my money right La, la, la-la (Yeah!) Then you can\u0027t tell me nothing, right? Excuse me, was you saying something? Uh-uh, you can\u0027t tell me nothing (Yeah! Haha!) You can\u0027t tell me nothing (Yeah! Yeah!) Uh-uh, you can\u0027t tell me nothing (Yeah!) [Verse 2: Kanye West] Let up the suicide doors This is my life, homie, you decide yours I know that Jesus died for us But I couldn\u0027t tell ya who decide wars So I parallel double-parked that motherfucker sideways Old folks talking \u0027bout, \"Back in my day\" But homie, this is my day Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late? No, I already graduated And you can live through anything if Magic made it They say I talk with so much emphasis Ooh, they so sensitive Don\u0027t ever fix your lips like collagen And say something when you gon\u0027 end up apolog\u0027ing Let me know if it\u0027s a problem then Aight, man, holla, then [Chorus: Kanye West \u0026 Jeezy] La, la, la-la Wait till I get my money right La, la, la-la (Yeah!) Then you can\u0027t tell me nothing, right? Excuse me, was you saying something? Uh-uh, you can\u0027t tell me nothing You can\u0027t tell me nothing Uh-uh, you can\u0027t tell me nothing [Verse 3: Kanye West] Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash Let that man get past He don\u0027t even stop to get gas If he can move through the rumors He can drive off of fumes cause How he move in a room full of no\u0027s? How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes? Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul So when he buried in a tomb full of gold Treasure, what\u0027s your pleasure? Life is a–uh–depending how you dress her So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada I\u0027m in between, but way more fresher With way less effort Cause when you try hard, that\u0027s when you die hard Your homies looking like, \"Why, God?\" When they reminisce over you, my God [Chorus: Kanye West \u0026 Jeezy] La, la, la-la Wait till I get my money right La, la, la-la Then you can\u0027t tell me nothing, right? Excuse me, was you saying something? Uh-uh, you can\u0027t tell me nothing You can\u0027t tell me nothing Uh-uh, you can\u0027t tell me nothing [Outro: Kanye West \u0026 Jeezy] La, la, la la Wait till I get my money right La, la, la la Then you can\u0027t tell me nothing, right?

  "This has nothing to do with the topic in the video, but each individual is so loved by our almighty Creator and GOD Jesus Christ. Jesus will have a relationship with us, which is not possible because sin separates us from Him. This was the case in the Old Covenant, but thanks to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, GOD Himself, who lived a life without sin and died individually for each of us, because even if it were just one person, He would have done the same. No one loves us more than Jesus. If you want to give your life true meaning and fill the emptiness within you, then you can only do that in Jesus Christ, the Way, the Truth, and the Life. If you believe that He died for your sins, rose again, and you confess your sins to Him, give your life to Him, and claim His blood, you will be born again, beginning a completely new life with our Savior Jesus Christ Amen Hallelujah❤️🙏🏻",

  "[Intro]  La la la la la la, wait \u0027til I get my snacks in here  La la la la la la, wait \u0027til I get my snacks in here [Verse 1]  I’m in the kitchen, it’s snack time, baby,  I’m snackin’ on chips like I\u0027m goin\u0027 crazy.  I got popcorn, nachos, and candy galore,  If you try to take one, I’ll make you a war!  I need my snacks, don’t tell me to stop,  I’ll take a whole pizza, then eat the last Pop-Tart!  I got the snacks lined up like I’m at a buffet,  Don\u0027t ask me for a bite, get outta my way! [Chorus]  You can’t tell me nothin’ (You can’t tell me nothin’)  You can’t tell me nothin’ (You can’t tell me nothin’)  I got Cheetos dust all over my shirt,  You can’t tell me nothin’ (You can’t tell me nothin’)  You can’t tell me nothin’ (You can’t tell me nothin’)  I’m snackin’ so hard, you can’t make it hurt! [Verse 2]  I got pretzels, cookies, and a gallon of ice cream,  You try to tell me it’s too much? You must be dreamin’.  I’m eating breakfast at midnight, lunch at 3 AM,  Tryin\u0027 to stop me? You’re just makin\u0027 a gem!  I got a snack stash that could fill a whole room,  I even hid some candy in my bathroom!  I’m in my prime, I\u0027m a snack king,  Don’t touch my trail mix, or you\u0027ll feel the sting! [Chorus]  You can’t tell me nothin’ (You can’t tell me nothin’)  You can’t tell me nothin’ (You can’t tell me nothin’)  If you try to judge me, I’ll just take a bite,  You can’t tell me nothin’ (You can’t tell me nothin’)  You can’t tell me nothin’ (You can’t tell me nothin’)  My snack game’s fire, and it’s outta sight! [Bridge]  I got chips, I got dip, I got cheese, I got Ritz,  I’ll eat ‘em all up, then I’ll throw a little fit!  Don\u0027t even talk to me ‘bout my \"snack attack,\"  If you try to take my M\u0026Ms, you won’t come back! [Chorus]  You can’t tell me nothing’ (You can’t tell me nothin’)  You can’t tell me nothin’ (You can’t tell me nothin’)  I’m on my third bag of Doritos, no shame,  You can’t tell me nothin’ (You can’t tell me nothin’)  You can’t tell me nothin’ (You can’t tell me nothin’)  If it’s snack time, you best know my name! [Outro]  La la la la la la, wait \u0027til I get my snacks in here  La la la la la la, wait \u0027til I get my snacks in here",

Eric Hillman is one of my besties and his brother used to be a Harlem.globetroter and his cousin is all R\u0026B in 112.  Truth is stranger than fiction aint it?. Made me feel so comfortable all grown up like Rudy Huxtable..... (except it was really Clementine Bill Cosbys brothers wife and her twin sister Irma  Jeanne who was work besties with my grandpa. They catered my.mommas wedding.  Imagine that. See how when I say it there aint no backstabbing bitch shit like in hot sauce world with nasty skanks like megan using her nasty imagination.😮 I miss Eric. Get out of jail already :(  i told him not to ride dirty on a holiday when he left my house to go to gwens and he got a dlat tire  after he left her house and the cops rolled up on him.and illegally searched him for the third time.in like 2 months. Someone should really sue them for racial profiling  :( Eric is the only one I miss.

This is whatever I put on when its a grey day and im on my way to a job I dont like but need in order to be able to work towards a life I do want. It\u0027s this sort of disappointed, cynical confidence and sense of Calmth that comes from within. Ill sit in the subway just looking ahead, surrounded by all these other people doing their own thing, having their own dreams and fears and ill never know what they are but for some reason I am a total objective onlooker and things that dont matter but can momentarily upset me normally dont even reach me. I can see shit for what it is and I know shit won\u0027t easily disappoint me or upset me, because I have already processed the world and its woes in a way.  Thats the feeling this song gives me, not sure if that made sense. Kanye can be so great at times, the lyrics, the sample , the emotions. Perfection",

I think the people who help you excavate them would much prefer that so they dont get accused of being unfair and no one is being mistreated. Also i wpuld recommend signing a declaration on this accessible to the public. Look both sides need trade dont bite the hand that feeds you it works two ways and kanye u killed the song with that at the beginning. Did you know tjere are so many starving people in the wprld that are too proud to moan and ask for help . Help everyone as long as they woll then eventually help themselves but that\u0027s rehabilitation for not just addiction for the homeless and for people in circumstances that cpuld be detrimental to their future.

  "Перевод песни Kanye West — «Can’t Tell Me Nothing»] [Интро: Kanye West \u0026 Jeezy] Ла, ла, ла, ла (Е) Подожди пока я получу свои деньги, хорошо? [Куплет 1: Kanye West] Мне снился сон, что я могу купить себе путь в рай Когда я проснулся, я потратил эти деньги на колье Я сказал Господу, что вернусь через секунду Чёрт, так тяжело не действовать безрассудно На тех, кому дано многое, многое и проверяется Будет арестован до тех пор, пока не поймёт Я чувствую давление под пристальным вниманием И что я делаю? Действую еще тупее Купил больше украшений, больше Louis V Моя мама не могла достучаться до меня Драма, люди подают на меня в суд А я разговариваю по телевидению будто там только ты и я Я просто говорю о том, что чувствую, чувак Я не из семьи Косби, я не пойду в Хиллман Думаю, деньги должны были изменить его Думаю, я забыл, откуда я сам родом Припев: Kanye West \u0026 Jeezy] Ла, ла, ла, ла (Эй) Подожди, пока я получу свои деньги, хорошо? Ла, ла, ла, ла (Е) И потом ты не сможешь сказать мне ничего, верно? Прости, ты что-то говорил? А-а, ты не можешь мне ничего сказать (Е, ха-ха) Ты не можешь мне ничего сказать (Е, е) А-а, ты не можешь мне ничего сказать (Е) [Куплет 2: Kanye West] Подними двери-самоубийцы Это моя жизнь, дружище, ты выбираешь свою сам Я знаю, что Иисус умер ради нас Но я не могу сказать, кто тогда устраивает войны Поэтому я паркуюсь на два места Старики говорят: «А вот в мои времена» Но, дружище, это мои времена Урок начался 2 часа назад, о, я опоздал? Нет, я уже окончил учебу И ты можешь пережить все, если Маджик сделал это Они говорят, что я говорю с таким особым акцентом О, они такие чувствительные Никогда не исправляй губы коллагеном И не говори чего-то, о чём позднее будешь жалеть Дай мне знать, если есть проблемы Ладно, чувак, созвонимся тогда ла, ла, ла Подожди, пока я получу свои деньги, хорошо? Ла, ла, ла, ла (Е) И потом ты не сможешь сказать мне ничего, верно? Прости, ты что-то говорил? А-а, ты не можешь мне ничего сказать Ты не можешь мне ничего сказать А-а, ты не можешь мне ничего сказать [Куплет 3: Kanye West] Пусть плещется шампанское, пусть этот человек получит деньги Дай этому парню пройти Он даже не останавливается на заправке Если он может справиться со слухами, он может и ехать без топлива Как он передвигается в комнате полной отказов? Как он остается верным в комнате полной проституток? Должно быть фараоны, он в гармонии с душой Поэтому он похоронен в могиле, полной золота Сокровище, какое удовольствие по душе тебе? Жизнь — это, ну, смотря как ты её украшаешь Так что если Дьявол носит Прада, Адам и Ева нагие Я как-то по середине, но гораздо свежее выгляжу И с гораздо меньшими усилиями, потому что когда ты сильно стараешься Ты мучительно умираешь Твои друзья смотрят типа, Боже, почему? Когда они вспоминают о тебе, мой Бог Припев: Kanye West \u0026 Jeezy] Ла, ла, ла, ла Подожди, пока я получу свои деньги, хорошо? Ла, ла, ла, ла И потом ты не сможешь сказать мне ничего, верно? Прости, ты что-то говорил? А-а, ты не можешь мне ничего сказать Ты не можешь мне ничего сказать А-а, ты не можешь мне ничего сказать [Аутро: Kanye West \u0026 Jeezy] Ла, ла, ла, ла Подожди, пока я получу свои деньги, хорошо? Ла, ла, ла, ла И потом ты не сможешь сказать мне ничего, верно? (Я серьёзно, нигга, у меня есть деньги)",
