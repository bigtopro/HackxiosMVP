{Jesus Christ Saves Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time. Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God. EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God: 1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord. 2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead. Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 7. John 3:16 God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.}

{Many will enter by the wide gate and say “Lord, Lord did we not cast out many demons in your name?” And He will say “Depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you”. The question to the reader of this comment: Are you going to learn about Jesus Christ before or after you die? The best option is before. Jesus switched places with us wicked humans to take the punishment we all deserve on that Cross. He died, was completely separated from God, and then rose on the third day so that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. God always Has reigned before time and He will continue to reign after time. Repent and put your trust in Jesus Christ before time runs out.}
