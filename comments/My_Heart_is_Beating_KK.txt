{Awesome song}
{Spent more than a decade saving myself,waiting for that one girl. Made her truly realise that i would let the world burn if that's what it means to keep her. Spent days in the dark protecting her light even after she rejected me one time before. Went to war with the guy who spread scandals about her.. got myself hurt to save her image and her potentially. All for just to hear from her after a decade that she just doesn't feel the same way about me. Now heartbroken, carrying a heavy chest, still praying to god to not let her suffer any time in her life.}

God will send your perfect match infact more than a perfect match with whom you will be so happy, you would be able to share anything literally anything, I used to think these are shits and it's never gonna happen but on 4th May 2022 I finally met her and she already proposed me but I waited till my birthday to tell her that I also love her so on 30th June 2022 I finally gave her the reply that she was waiting for and then I told her to start counting our relationship days from this day because that was the day when I was born and I wanted to make it a day when I am reborn with my love so I reborned on 30th June 2022 with my life partner my love and we both will never forget 30th June 2022. Ignore my bad English, focus on my feelings and pray :)}
