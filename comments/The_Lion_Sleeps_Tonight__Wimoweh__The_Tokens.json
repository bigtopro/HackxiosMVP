  "Hello guys. I am here for warning. Not to put fear. But Jesus Christ is coming back. Like it or not. Wake up! We are in the 2024 where the world is about to be under God\u0027s judgement. It won\u0027t get any better. A lot of strange things will happen anywhere. Jesus Christ loves you and he died for you. He died so you could live Forever with him. He separated from you and him the wall of unlaw that separated you completely from God. He died so he could have saved you from your wrongness and addiction, from depression, from anxiety, traumas, from the darkness pits of your life. God wants you to acknowledge that he is God and he lives! You don\u0027t believe in God because you saw him, but because you heard and you believed, which is faith! He wants you to know he loves you and he wants to do amazing works in you. But if you do not change ways, It\u0027s going to become harder. As long as there is time, believe in him, He is coming. Once he won\u0027t be found no more, Once his spirit leaves his earth there won\u0027t be no time. Change your ways, learn to do good, seek the lord. He wants to have an amazing relationship with you. That\u0027s what he has been wanting... Your heart. That What\u0027s he died and resurrected for, when he resurrected, the will of the father got fulfilled of it all. Repent, For the kingdom of God is near. Fix your ways. Jesus Christ is God. And there is no other god after him. Said in Isaiah, said in John. Jesus is God, who renounced his part of divinity to turn into a man like us. Read the word of God for yourself. Repent! Jesus loves you.",

My school made us do an e-learning week in its interim phase and for english class we had to watch this stupid video and comment how we feel about it and if we enjoyed it or not. I said this video was annoying, ugly, a waste of my time as a student who could be in school learning something (phrased politely) and when we got back to school my teacher called me a bitch and asked me what my problem was in front of the whole class. I abhor this video and this song. Ugly sack of shit annoying ass music. Anyway I\u0027m diagnosed with autism so if you ask me how i feel, why would i lie? It is so weird for people to show others something they enjoy and when the other party does not reciprocate the emotion, they get offended. Not everyone is going to like this shit. Get fucked",

  "Jesus Christ Saves Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time. Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God. EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God: 1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord. 2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead. Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 \u0026 9 7. John 3:16 God bless you, peace be with you always.

  "he composition \"In the Jungle, the mighty jungle...\" is a profound auditory experience that transcends its apparent simplicity, emerging as an anthem celebrating the essential harmony between human existence and the natural world. Its melodic cadence and lyrical simplicity belie the intricate interplay between nature and culture that it encapsulates. The recurrent incantation, \"In the jungle, the mighty jungle,\" encapsulates a transcendent rhythm, akin to the reverberation of Earth\u0027s pulse. It assumes the role of an auditory talisman, weaving a tapestry that echoes the heartbeat of nature itself. The leonine roar within the song represents an embodiment of untamed wilderness, a symphonic testament to the formidable force of the animal kingdom. Moreover, this song stands as a poignant cultural bridge, invoking a rich tapestry of emotions, memories, and associations, igniting discussions around the exotic, the unbridled, and the infinite fascination of the natural realm. It serves as a catalyst for introspection on humanity\u0027s intricate relationship with this sprawling ecosystem, prompting contemplation of the planet\u0027s fragility and its resplendent magnificence. This song, within its lyrical brevity, urges us to reflect on the urgency of conserving the planet\u0027s myriad ecosystems, shielding the intricate tapestry of life that thrives within them. \"In the Jungle\" is a musical opus that communes with the primal, the spiritual, and the transcendental facets of our connection with the world, offering a profound reminder of the magnificent symphony of existence that envelops us.",

  "I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don\u0027t think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it\u0027s great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I\u0027m struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

The dancing cat, This made me tear up. How could such a cat do such a thing? I\u0027m struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Cat dancing has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you.",

With the strength of the lion, the grace of the deer, In the mighty jungle, there\u0027s nothing to fear. (Verse 2) Through the dense foliage we\u0027ll wander, Underneath the canopy\u0027s shade, With the sunbeams peeking through, Nature\u0027s wonders on display. (Chorus) In the mighty jungle, we\u0027ll dance and we\u0027ll sing, To the beat of nature\u0027s symphony, let the echoes ring. With the strength of the lion, the grace of the deer, In the mighty jungle, there\u0027s nothing to fear. (Bridge) From the tallest trees to the smallest streams, Every creature finds its place, living their dreams. In harmony we\u0027ll stand, united and strong, In the mighty jungle, where we all belong. (Chorus) In the mighty jungle, we\u0027ll dance and we\u0027ll sing, To the beat of nature\u0027s symphony, let the echoes ring. With the strength of the lion, the grace of the deer, In the mighty jungle, there\u0027s nothing to fear. (Outro) So let\u0027s embrace the wild within, And let the rhythm guide our way. In the mighty jungle, we\u0027ll find our freedom, Forever in nature\u0027s sway.",

It got covered by folk groups in the 1950-60s, the most famous version in the US by the Tokens, so that\u0027s the song Gen-Xers know from growing up in the 1970-80s and having to listen to their parents\u0027 music. Millennials know it from the 1994 Lion King.  The hippo and dog are from a 2003 French cartoon show called Pat and Stan, although this particular clip is from an Italian commercial for Kinder chocolates. This gets uploaded in 2006, and now for some reason it\u0027s 2019 and YouTube is recommending it. This song must have some kind of mystical staying power--we\u0027re going to be hearing it 1000 years from now.",

  "Need to write a long essay I got you brother While a number of the most important reform movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries grew out of efforts to combat the negative effects of industrialization, the main focus of their efforts was not the impact of the Industrial Revolution on the natural environment. Although some reformers, such as Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot, were deeply worried about the consequences of economic development on the natural environment, the most influential, most effective reformers were primarily concerned with the impact of the rise of big business on small businesses, industrial workers, and consumers, and with corruption in government that reformers believed resulted from the economic power of large corporations. Farmers were upset at what they regarded as arbitrary and excessive railroad rates and abuses such as rebates to big business like Standard Oil. These farmers were among the first and most outspoken advocates of reform in the late 19th century. Pressure from the Farmers’ Alliances convinced Congress to pass and President Cleveland to sign the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, a piece of legislation designed to regulate railroad rates and prohibit corrupt practices such as rebates. By 1890, these Farmers’ Alliances had entered politics in a number of Southern and Midwestern states and succeeded in pressuring Congress to pass the Sherman Antitrust Act, outlawing all “combinations in restraint of trade.” By 1892, a national People’s Party had been organized, nominating a third-party presidential candidate and electing several members of Congress. The Populist movement, a reform movement attempting to combat the negative effects of industrialization and the rise of big business, was now in full swing. Beginning at the state level and with strong support in many urban areas, a new progressive movement reached the national level during the first years of the 20th century. Supported by President Theodore Roosevelt, progressive reformers, like the Populists, sought to strengthen railroad regulation and both enforce and further strengthen the antitrust laws. In 1902, President Roosevelt not only forced mine owners to submit to arbitration to settle a nationwide coal strike, he also asked his attorney general to file an antitrust suit against the Northern Securities Company, a large railroad holding company. After the Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision to break up the Northern Securities Company in 1904, Roosevelt went on to strengthen the Interstate Commerce Commission’s ability to regulate railroad rates by pushing the Hepburn Act through Congress in 1906. A few years later, another progressive reformer, Woodrow Wilson, succeeded to the presidency, and he managed to further strengthen the antitrust laws by pushing the Clayton Antitrust Act through Congress in 1914. While railroad regulation and antitrust actions attracted the most attention of reformers during the period 1880–1920, some efforts were made by reformers to mitigate the effects of industrialization and commercial expansion on the natural environment. President Roosevelt used his executive authority to put thousands of acres of public lands aside for national parks, saving them from commercial exploitation. In 1908, he convened a conservation conference at the White House in an effort to further mitigate the damage that mining and manufacturing were doing to the natural environment, especially in the West. President Roosevelt also pushed for the establishment of the forest service and appointed a conservation-minded ally, Gifford Pinchot, to head that agency. Finally, even after retiring from office, Roosevelt supported Pinchot in his efforts to prevent President Taft’s secretary of the interior, Richard Ballinger, from opening additional public lands to commercial exploitation. Thus, both the populist and progressive movements sought to combat the negative effects of industrialization and economic expansion by focusing primarily on railroad regulation and the strengthening and enforcement of antitrust legislation. Nevertheless, some progressive reformers like Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot did pay significant attention to preventing further damage to the natural environment and helped to found the modern conservation movement. This thesis statement establishes a clear argument that addresses all parts of the question and makes a clear argument, earning one point. It does a nice job of demonstrating that at least two reform movements were not just aimed at the effects of the Industrial Revolution, but also at the impact on small business, workers, and consumers, as well as corruption in government. Through its clear thesis, the essay is also able to address the targeted skill of causation by dealing with the causes and effects of the events mentioned in the question, for which it earns both of the possible points. In its body paragraphs, the essay also does a very good job of identifying and using specific evidence to support its argument. It cites the Farmers’ Alliances and their role in pushing for the Interstate Commerce Act and Sherman Antitrust Act. In addition, the essay uses a lot of pertinent information from the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt to support the thesis statement and also addresses how there were some reforms that dealt with the natural environment, i.e., national parks and the forest service. These examples also address the targeted skill by showing the cause and effect of these events in relation to the reform movements, earning two more points. You also are able to meet the last point by applying the skill of synthesis. You modified the statement in developing your argument and employed the use of other categories. This essay scores a 6 out of a possible 6 points.",

While railroad regulation and antitrust actions attracted the most attention of reformers during the period 1880–1920, some efforts were made by reformers to mitigate the effects of industrialization and commercial expansion on the natural environment. President Roosevelt used his executive authority to put thousands of acres of public lands aside for national parks, saving them from commercial exploitation. In 1908, he convened a conservation conference at the White House in an effort to further mitigate the damage that mining and manufacturing were doing to the natural environment, especially in the West. President Roosevelt also pushed for the establishment of the forest service and appointed a conservation-minded ally, Gifford Pinchot, to head that agency. Finally, even after retiring from office, Roosevelt supported Pinchot in his efforts to prevent President Taft’s secretary of the interior, Richard Ballinger, from opening additional public lands to commercial exploitation. Thus, both the populist and progressive movements sought to combat the negative effects of industrialization and economic expansion by focusing primarily on railroad regulation and the strengthening and enforcement of antitrust legislation. Nevertheless, some progressive reformers like Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot did pay significant attention to preventing further damage to the natural environment and helped to found the modern conservation movement. This thesis statement establishes a clear argument that addresses all parts of the question and makes a clear argument, earning one point. It does a nice job of demonstrating that at least two reform movements were not just aimed at the effects of the Industrial Revolution, but also at the impact on small business, workers, and consumers, as well as corruption in government. Through its clear thesis, the essay is also able to address the targeted skill of causation by dealing with the causes and effects of the events mentioned in the question, for which it earns both of the possible points. In its body paragraphs, the essay also does a very good job of identifying and using specific evidence to support its argument. It cites the Farmers’ Alliances and their role in pushing for the Interstate Commerce Act and Sherman Antitrust Act. In addition, the essay uses a lot of pertinent information from the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt to support the thesis statement and also addresses how there were some reforms that dealt with the natural environment, i.e., national parks and the forest service. These examples also address the targeted skill by showing the cause and effect of these events in relation to the reform movements, earning two more points. You also are able to meet the last point by applying the skill of synthesis. You modified the statement in developing your argument and employed the use of other categories. This essay scores a 6 out of a possible 6 points.",

  "Me and my wife were downstairs watching a hallmark movie, and a cranberry sprite commercial Turned on. That was when me and her decided to go to bed.  We both had a long day at work and were feeling very tired.  As I brushed my teeth I felt a sweet clear carbonation come out of my mouth as I washed out my mouth, but due to the tired state I was in I thought nothing of it. I later went into my bed and within seconds of falling into the mattress I fell asleep cold.  I woke up at 3am, as I always seem to do and went to the bathroom and noticed my urine was a clear carbonated color, like when I washed my mouth out, so later that day I scheduled an appointment with my doctor. When I saw him he said that this was a unique condition and he had seen nothing of it.  He told me to keep note of when it happened, and with what fluids.   Later that day I was in my house with my wife when I see a broken down old white van pull up outside my front lawn.  I assumed they were a company and were working with my next door neighbors, when a tall African American man walks out with something in his hands that appears to make out some sort of rod and a red can.  I later hear loud banging on my door and a voice screaming “open the door right now!!” I immediately pull out my cell phone and in terror call 911 trying to speak quietly so this man doesn’t hear while my wife runs to the gun safe and pulls out a shot gun for protection.  As the banging gets louder and louder me and my wife shiver in fear, until the door falls down.  LeBron James with a lakers jersey, a baton, and a sprite cranberry appears in the doorway.  Immediately he runs over to me and pulls out a gun form his waist, and threatens to shoot.  Me in terror stand in front of my wife and grab the shotgun, and with a nervous twitch I switch the safety and pull the trigger...but nothing.  The gun appears to be jammed.  Even more terrified I open to see it gushing with sprite cranberry.  All of a sudden all our toilets and sinks start overflowing and gushing out sprite cranberry and flooding the house.  LeBron says “you should’ve just bought it when you saw the commercial, I guess we will have to take care of you!” When I hear the word “we” I am immediately puzzled until I see some sort of grey figure appear in the distance from the van.  He runs to my house and is equipped with an ak47.  I later realize he is the hippo in the “Lion sleeps tonight” children’s animation, and I am in terror.  I scream “What will you to do us?!” And LeBron responds “oh I won’t do anything, he’ll take care of it”.  Right as the hippo opens for fire both him and LeBron are distracted by flashing blue and red lights in the background. They rush to the house, and take down both LeBron and the hippo, saving me and my wife. To this day I am thankful the cops were there, because I don’t know what could possibly of happened if they weren’t.  What to take from this is if LeBron James has one query that consists of him offering you a sprite cranberry, just know the answer is clear.  Thank you. (Yes I wrote this entirely didn’t copy and paste a word of it, I know I have too much time on my hands).",

When he saw that he kicked me off the house after telling me that I should never again get in our house and because I had nothing else to do I went to the jungle. I was trying very hard to lose those extra kilos. Suddently an explorer found me thinking I was a rare spece of hippo and  he made me sing this. I couldnt tell him I was a human because my mouth was full of food. So thats how I participated in this video! THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR READING .",

I honestly can\u0027t remember if we ever performed it.. but Mr Burns, if you\u0027re out there, thankyou for the highlight of my childhood.",
