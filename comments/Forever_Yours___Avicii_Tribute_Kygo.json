  "Yea true but it’s just a simple little edit, Avicii made like every part of this song, and Sandro made all the lyrics. Tygo or whatever his name is shouldn’t just slap his name on top and say “with Avicii \u0026 Sandro Cavazza” that makes me sick. That’s not something you should do for a tribute, dick move",
  "OysuL dislike from me, I bet your answer will change when I tell you this. Sandro asked Kygo to finish this song. And told him this is your tribute. That’s why it is by Kygo. No hate, just letting you know before you talk more crap on Kygo ✊",
  "@@suzanneagundez5190 this right here  ☝️",

  "OysuL you should go watch the making of this song and you will have a different perspective. Avicii was Kygos idol growing up and the reason he started making electronic music. This is a tribute to his idol, not trying to take credit for his music at all",
  "@@OysuL  First it\u0027s Kygo not \"tygo\"  Second this is a tribute that Kygo and Sandro made or should I say \"recreate\" for avicii since there\u0027s no official release for this song and Third u should rlly watch the  behind the scenes or the making of this song on Sandro\u0027s Chanel Correct me if I\u0027m wrong :)",

  "@@richo9911 youre right, he ruined the song also",
  "@@lms5608 I quite like the song actually, but I prefer Avicii\u0027s. Kygo could never even come close to dear Tim. ❤",
  "@@richo9911 Could have been management related that his name is first, but like others have said, Sandro reached out to Kygo and told him that it was *his* tribute. Sandro literally told Kygo that this is Kygo\u0027s tribute, that\u0027s why Kygos name is first. You can\u0027t come at Kygo for this, Sandro is the man who put Kygo as the first name. If Kygo was such a dick, he could\u0027ve left out Avicii and Sandro, and uploaded it on his own channel instead :)",
  "@@marcus890 I\u0027m not trashing or saying Kygo is a dick, I quite like his music. I just don\u0027t agree with his name being first when Sandro had written the song and Avicii had already produced it, being a perfectionist he obviously wasn\u0027t 100% happy because he didn\u0027t release it.",

Yes, I know it’s cool that you got to work on an Avicii project BUT it was perfect as is. I don’t think I can ever appreciate this version because I find myself going back instead to listen to the live cut version that Avicii made. Sandro, how was the version that Tim released not complete? Literally all you had to do was put out the exact version that he played in his set! Please at least release Tim’s original as a tribute, it won’t take away from what you and Kygo did. Thanks and all love, I appreciate everything Sandro, Kygo, and Avicii do for music",

Kygo had never been in the studio with avicii, never worked with him.. what he has done was pure passion, so he tried his best to get closest to Avicii\u0027s own music pattern.. i know he probbaly had many things to do but he still spent his time on the song, to put it into release. Kygo and also Sandro, they put their best into this song, so why not enjoying it as we all should do instead of complaining about it... i dont care if it is bad or not.. if it\u0027s avicii new song.. count me in, \u0027cuz hearing his songs one more time is the happiest thing that can happen to me.

  "Completely agree. I was so excited when TIM was released, but i ended up fairly disappointed in most the songs that weren\u0027t entirely produced by Tim.  You can 100% tell the difference between songs that are Avicii songs and ones which Tim may have worked on but we\u0027re completed by others.  It just doesn\u0027t feel like an Avicii album to me.  With that said, songs like Heaven are so incredibly powerful that it\u0027s worth buying the album for that one song alone.  I\u0027m sure it\u0027s because the lyrics and timing of release really hit home for me, but i cannot listen to that song without tearing up. It\u0027s brutal, but it\u0027s so beautiful at the same time.",
  "@@rfehr613 I know OMG same! Sometimes I actually have to skip that song because I know I\u0027m going to start crying my eyeballs out.I know what you mean I know for sure the album would have topped charts if he had made with all 16 songs included but I accept that the album was good tribute to a legend lost but it could have  made so much magic at the hands of Tim. And it breaks my heart most of all when I think of how it ended and people around me can\u0027t accept why his death affected me and so many fans really badly but they don\u0027t know how his music saved us in so many dark times and they don\u0027t bother listening to the songs close enough to hear the magic, the pain and passion he managed to weave into his music almost  effortlessly it seemed but I know sometimes it probably wasn\u0027t.Im sorry for the long paragraph but it\u0027s rare to find people who actually understand and stop calling me critical of the new album I mean it\u0027s amazing but it could have been so much different, for example the song SOS my whole perspective kind of shifted when I found out they had only the like lyrics  at the time of his death and they didn\u0027t even have a vocalist for the song i still love it though but it could have been so much different .Im the only one who really loves Avicii in my area as far as I know , so again I apologise for the long paragraph 🙂",
  "@@mephistopheles5735 it\u0027s tragic and sad what Tim was going through.  The reason i said it hits home for me is because one of my best friends killed himself a few years ago. Then a year later my uncle killed himself.  It fucks your whole world up.  Avicii was one of my (and my wife\u0027s) favorite artists. We walked out to Broken Arrows at our wedding reception in November.  But as much as I love songs like Heaven and SOS, the message behind them both just tears me up.  So much pain",

  "MusicCharts TV shut up dumbass",
  "@@MarcelReuling stfu",
  "True ❤❤❤👑",
  "Idk if you said this on accident, but the fact juices album was called legends never die, and this song was the same sample as lucid dreams juices most popular song too",
  "someone knows why there is U.S.A map?",
  "yuval the bunny, Sandro Cavazza wrote on his Instagram that the song was written during a bus tour with Avicii. After that tour they played the song right away at the festival Ultra. So I guess that\u0027s why.",
  "@@mlvdbos thanks",
  "Yassss ❤️",
  "Tim is smiling from heaven!◢◤ #riplegend",
  "Love love it!!!!!!!!!! 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️",
  "I prefer the two avicii versions.",
  "Yeah but they cant release an unfinished song and did you not like the Tim album either?  Because they did the same There just saying",
  "@@XastofiC they didn\u0027t do the same thing. The songs there were finished by talented people on the music industry that had already worked with Tim in the past and knew how to finish the tracks in the proper way. Kygo didn\u0027t know how to finish this and it shows. Sandro should have given this to Carl Falk",
  "@@XastofiC Heaven and others were left at a similar state as FY. They finished it. They didn\u0027t change it. I like the fact that it\u0027s out and that it\u0027s a tribute etc., but I really don\u0027t like the way they treated the song.",
  "and i thought i was the only one who likes the leaked version better...kygo should have just finished the song...it was already on the plate...there are reasons we  like to listen to avicii\u0027s unreleased",
