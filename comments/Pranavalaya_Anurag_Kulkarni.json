  "For hindi speaking....people  \"Pranavalaya\" का अर्थ और भावनाएं संस्कृत में बहुत गहराई से निहित हैं। इसे हिंदी में अनुवादित करना चुनौतीपूर्ण हो सकता है क्योंकि संस्कृत के शब्दों और भावनाओं को सही तरीके से व्यक्त करना मुश्किल हो सकता है। लेकिन यहाँ एक प्रयास किया गया है: **हिंदी में अनुवाद:** **प्रणवालय**   (ॐ का निवास) ओम्, तुम हो शक्ति के स्रोत,   सृष्टि के आदिस्वरूप, अनंत अनुग्रह के।   तुम्हारे चरणों में हम समर्पित,   हे देव, तुम्हारा ही सहारा है हमारा। तुम्हारे बिन, यह जगत अंधकारमय,   तुम हो प्रकाश, जीवन का आधार।   हमारी आत्मा तुमसे ही जाग्रत होती,   तुम्हारी कृपा से ही हमें शांति मिलती। सत्य का मार्ग तुमसे होकर गुजरता,   तुम ही हो सच्चा पथप्रदर्शक।   तुम्हारी ओर बढ़ता हर कदम हमें,   मुक्ति की ओर ले जाता, अंततः। ओम्, हे दिव्य स्वर,   तुम्हारी महिमा अपरंपार।   तुम ही हो सृष्टि की ध्वनि,   तुमसे ही जीवन का संचार। **भावार्थ:**   यह गीत भगवान की असीम शक्ति और कृपा का गुणगान करता है, और यह संदेश देता है कि उनके बिना संसार अंधकारमय है। भगवान की ओर बढ़ता हर कदम हमें मुक्ति की ओर ले जाता है, और उनकी कृपा से ही हमें जीवन में शांति मिलती है। यह अनुवाद मूल गीत के भाव और संदेश को हिंदी में व्यक्त करने का एक प्रयास है। संस्कृत के गहरे अर्थों को पूरी तरह से व्यक्त करना कठिन हो सकता है, लेकिन यह गीत भगवान के प्रति भक्ति और आस्था का प्रतीक है।",

  "Wow! I read it somewhere that even if it\u0027s abolished devdasis still exist huh? Like illegally please huh maybe it\u0027s difficult to abolish it even in 2023 😊!  Can you atleast regulate that system so that young girls are not exploited huh? I don\u0027t have any issues even if you see them like Goddesses and they remain unmarried it\u0027s like they\u0027re representating womanhood and connection of a woman to God in a spiritual way men should learn to respect women right? If they\u0027re so talented they should be livin\u0027 like artists this is not fair okay? It\u0027s horrible okay? No one has the right to exploit women in this world!

My actions are in accordance to what pleases you...   Observe how Devi obliges at 2:35 and accepts the prayer of this human  and at 2:51 full realization dawns on her..  Mother then absorbs that human in her fully and that human and Devi are not two but one towards the end.. Mother\u0027s  grace is her grace, Devi\u0027s power is all her power and finally she reveals her true Self as Devi in the end.. When will you turn to me ohh Mother?",

The singer\u0027s voice sounded very similar to Javed Ali...though I didn\u0027t think he would agree to sing it. Its Anurag Kulkarni, and it makes me so proud that he\u0027s Marathi. Amazing composition. Amazing performance by Sai Pallavi and the dancers too. The step at 0:42, he sings about her lotus seat and the dancers make a lotus around Sai, it\u0027s beautiful to see. In fact, the cinematography and set design and even coloring is reminiscent of Sanjay Leela Bhansali\u0027s work. His dance songs celebrate the song itself, and they do it with grandeur, and I see this song doing exactly that, esp at 3:12. God, that moment gave me chills.",

Finely executed classical dance in recent times, Only spoiled by poor editing by unnecessarily showing the singer and Nani too many times and too many cuts. Just showing the beautiful choreography fully without cuts, would have taken this song to a different level like Ghumaro, Ghumaro and dola re dola. Feel like the director missed a great opportunity or underestimated the  beauty of classical dance and the gracefullness of Sai Pallavi. I wish only Sai Pallavi with dancers was shown in the whole song fully with nobody else.",

I loved that the female lead, she dances not to please anyone or express her emotions for anyone but to the Devine, Maa Durga/ Sri devi alone. I loved the way that Sai Pallavi becomes Sri devi depicting the God\u0027s kindness and the way she kept fighting and in end killed the demon, and other time Sai Pallavi becomes a simple devote expressing sincere devotion. The song connected me to Sri Devi and I couldn\u0027t stop my tears, it was so beautiful! I even liked the way the Shyam starts to realize his feelings towards Rosie through those lyrics too.

  "What I liked the most about Eastern India that we don\u0027t indulge in so much of how the culture is portrayed even if certain things don\u0027t exactly represent the location or city. The dance forms used in this song are not what typically Bengali culture is known for. The the most famous dance form is Kathak apart from other folk dances and natya. However, if this was somehow done by Hindi cinema or any cinema other than southern cinema while they are representing southern part of India most of the southern part people would have boycotted and objected stating this is not our culture, this is against our sentiments(that\u0027s what happened to many movies including meenakshi sundareshwar, (received hate comments from Tamil people in the name of culture even though it actually represented so well as the director Musician all were the representative of their states). I can understand how much of hard work goes into making a movie. Being a Bengali, I really loved the movie. And being from Eastern part of India really don\u0027t care if the dance form is what actually we have or is a representation of some other part of the country. I hope this gesture where people who are not from southern states assimilate and accept and don\u0027t go into false pride and false nationalism is taken by southern states people as well, a sense of that understanding. We enjoy Bharatnatyam, Kuchipudi as much as Kathak. A very beautiful movie and doesn\u0027t matter if they didn\u0027t take anyone from Bengali cinema to represent Bengal social movement(what is often argued by most of the people of the southern states). A Wonderful try!",

Thanks to Sri Sirivennela- for allowing us to enjoy such songs even after he left us to enlighten the gods. In this song, heroin is depicted as a goddess in the thoughts of hero.. highest level of love. Hey godess- is it not your duty to be gracious towards to this orphan?",
  "Nothing is bengali about it. Neither good nor bad.",
  "🚩🚩🚩🚩",
  "I wish they had researched on Bengal and bengali culture. The song and choreography is great no doubt but what was the necessity to stage the film around bengal when they couldn\u0027t get even one thing right about bengal and bengalis.  Wrong spellings, stereotyping roshogolla, wrong festivities and what not. Bengalis don\u0027t celebrate Navaratri but Durga pujo. Bengal never had Mahant concept, neither Devdasis. The idol was neither of maa durga, nor of maa kali. Wish they had spent some money on a research team before making such a calous movie.",
  "This song is a perfect example how different art forms came out so beautifully. Firstly lyrics by Sastry garu is outstanding and it clearly brought out the devadasi\u0027s emotions which is where the story revolves. Secondly dance by Sai pallavi is par excellence especially the emotions she brought out in the song (sacrifices, pain, anger, strength). Choreographer has done a brilliant job of fusing different dance forms. Hats off to Anurag and Mickey for this divine composition. Great work by the director as well. Kudos to the whole team. You guys deserve a standing ovation.",

  "I am a Bengali, born and brought up in Kolkata, and I must say right from my childhood I got introduced to South Indian music and art. I am a music aficionado and just like everyone knows Bengal for its art and culture, Bengali\u0027s look upto South India and celebrates its music and art forms like no one else. This song has become one of my personal favourite and the core reason being Sai Pallavi. I adore and respect her a lot. When she comes on screen everything around her just freezes, and in this song she is looking absolute divine, feels like true goddess is dancing. She has again proved that dancing is just not about perfect steps it\u0027s a lot more than that. Singing, Music, choreography, set everything is stunning and spectacular, and also special mention to Nani, his eyes speaks thousand words. This song in its entirety is a masterpiece. As a Bengali I feel so proud when someone hails our culture and portrays it so beautifully",

  "This movie has a lot of potential. At least with Shyam Singha Roy’s character. Director made sincere efforts to project what he can with what he had. If he is given much liberty, more money, this movie could have been a pan india masterpiece. It settled as a small movie that went out of scope instead. Climax was horrible and cringe to watch. Nani, Sai pallavi and everyone in the climax scenes were horrible. The entire climax scenes are unnecessary. But thats what the director got and he worked with them. Its like a song. That builds up to a moment, then when it has the moment to end on a high note, singer struggles to deliver.  This could be a beautiful movie. Its just a good movie now as the way it is made. Depth is always the height of measure in any artistic form.",

  "అద్భుతం జరిగేటప్పుడు ఎవ్వరు గుర్తించరు, జరిగాక  గుర్తించాల్సిన పని లేదు\" , త్రివిక్రమ్ గారి మాట ఇది. కానీ \"ప్రణవాలయ పాహి \" అన్న అద్భుతాన్ని ఏమనుకొని సృష్టించారో కానీ సంగీతం సాహిత్యం అంటే ఇష్టం ఉన్న ప్రతి ఒక్కరు , గుండెల్లో దాచుకోవాల్సిన పాట ఇది. సాహిత్యానికి అర్ధం చెప్పేంత విద్వత్తు లేదు, కానీ ఆ అక్షరాల్లో ని ఆవేశాన్ని , భావోద్వేగాన్ని ఆసాంతం అనుభవించే అభిరుచి ఉంది. శ్యాం సింగ రాయ్ అన్న సినిమా రాకపోయుంటే ? దానికి మిక్కీ  జె  మేయర్ గారు   సంగీతం అందించకపోయుంటే?, సిరివెన్నెల గారు కాక ఇంకెవరైనా రాసుంటే? కచ్చితంగా తెలుగు వారంతా ఒక గొప్ప పాటని వినలేకపోయే వాళ్ళం. పాట  విడుదలయ్యి ఇన్ని రోజులయ్యాక ఏంటీ వివరణ అనుకుంటే ఒక్కసారి ఏ రోజు విడుదల ఐన వీడియో సాంగ్ చూడాలి. సాయి పల్లవి ని ఈ పాట  చూసాక \"సాయి పల్లవి గారు\" అని సంభోదించాలనిపిస్తోంది . ఎప్పుడో సప్తపది లో \"అఖిలాండేశ్వరి చాముండేశ్వరి \" పాటలో సబిత గారి అభినయం తర్వాత ఆ స్థాయిలో పాట  లోని అర్ధాన్ని అనితరసాధ్యంగా అభినయించారు సాయి పల్లవి గారు. ముఖ్యంగా \"దేహమునే కోవెలగ నిన్ను కొలువుంచా \" ఈ  లైన్ దగ్గర ఆవిడ ముఖ కవళికలు  మాటల్లో వర్ణించలేం . తెర మీద ఎరుపు రంగు నక్షత్రాల సమూహం అమ్మ వారిని అర్చించినట్టు గా ఉంటుంది.  ఈ పాట  విన్నాక, చూసాక సిరివెన్నెల గారు లేని లోటు ఎంత ఉండబోతుందో అర్ధమవుతోంది. ఇది విషాద గీతమో , విరహ గీతమో కాదు కన్నీళ్లు రావటానికి,కానీ మనసు పెట్టి వింటే మాత్రం కన్నీళ్లు పెట్టకుండా ఉండలేం. ఈ పాటని చూసాక కాసేపటి వరకు అందులో నుంచి బైటకు రాలేం . యూట్యూబ్ లో ఎన్ని వ్యూస్ వస్తాయన్న దాని మీద పాట సక్సెస్ ని జడ్జ్  చేస్తున్నారు, ఈ పాటలో ఉన్న అంతర్గత శక్తి ని వ్యూస్ తో, లైక్స్ తో కొలవలేం. రాబోయే రోజుల్లో తెలుగు సినిమాల్లో క్లాసికల్ సాంగ్ తీయాలంటే ప్రణవాలయ పాహి పాటని ముందుంచుకొని ఒక పాఠం లా నేర్చుకోవాలి.",
