  "In the dim glow of the supermarket fridge, the gallon of milk sat proudly among its peers, fresh and full of promise. It was chosen by a hurried shopper who barely glanced at the expiration date, tossing it into a cart alongside frozen dinners and cereal. The milk was excited—it had a purpose! A noble fate awaited: to be poured over morning bowls of cereal, mixed into coffee, or perhaps even turned into a batch of pancakes. But fate, as it turned out, had a much crueler plan.   The trouble began when the shopper forgot the grocery bags in the car and left the milk sitting in the warm trunk for hours. The heat began working its magic, churning the once-pure liquid into something more sinister. By the time it reached the fridge, the damage had already begun. Days passed, and the milk was neglected, its cap never twisted open. Then came the betrayal—when someone finally reached for it, a single sniff sent them gagging. \"Ugh, it\u0027s spoiled!\" they declared before shoving the jug back into the fridge as if hoping the problem would fix itself.   Time dragged on. The milk, now lumpy and reeking, was pushed further into the cold abyss, forgotten behind juice cartons and leftover takeout. Days turned to weeks, its plastic prison bloating ominously. It dreamed of escape, of being poured down the sink and finally finding peace, but its suffering continued. Then, one fateful evening, the fridge door opened, and a hand reached in—gripping the jug carelessly. As it was pulled out, disaster struck. A weak spot in the plastic, swollen from the fermentation inside, gave way with a sickening *pop*. The gallon exploded onto the floor, releasing its putrid, curdled essence into the world.   The smell was unspeakable. The humans recoiled, gagging, cursing, scrambling for paper towels. The milk had finally won. It had suffered through heat, neglect, and abandonment, but in the end, it had the last laugh. Its odorous legacy would haunt the kitchen for weeks to come. Epilogue: this milk gallon has aged 10 times better the the first line in this song. (Also, yes, chatgpt was used)",

  "New opening line I thought of just to keep something similar to the original intended meaning before everything about *_you-know-who_* was revealed: \"Wake up in the mornin\u0027 feelin\u0027 nice and pretty\" ...Yeah, I know, it sucks, it doesn\u0027t fit the tone, it\u0027s half-baked...BUT I REALLY TRIED, OKAY? Then again, to be fair, gotta look your best for a night on the town, ya know? That reminds me of the time I braved my way through an entire drinking glass of vodka when I was home alone for the night; I was on the computer most of the night, but then I somehow wound up lying on my back on the floor, and then I woke up in my bed the next morning...It was an interesting experience that I\u0027ve been secretly trying to recreate since then, but I haven\u0027t been able to down a whole glass of vodka again...I mean, it’s not like I *plan* for it to happen again — it’s more like, every now and then I pour myself a drink and I *think* I’m gonna be brave, you know? I psych myself up. I put on some ambient synthwave playlist on YouTube, dim the lights like I’m about to have a spiritual awakening, and stare dramatically at the glass like it holds the secrets of the universe. But then I take one sip, and my stomach just goes, \"Nope. Not today, friend.\" Like it remembers *too* well. Honestly, I’m convinced that night was a fluke. A one-time alignment of the stars and poor decision-making. Maybe Mercury was in retrograde. Maybe my body just gave up arguing. But part of me keeps chasing that weirdly magical blackout — *not* the hangover or the \"why is there a sock in the toaster\" part, but the surreal serenity of lying on the floor like a starfish, arms spread like I was waiting for aliens to beam me up. And what gets me is that I woke up in bed. *In bed!* No memory of getting there, no trail of breadcrumbs, no mystery bruises or ominous texts. Just — poof, like I had a responsible twin I didn’t know about who came out at night to tuck me in. I even checked the door locks. All locked. I\u0027m an only child (kinda). I don’t have a responsible twin. Unless — hear me out — it was future me doing some sort of quantum kindness, popping back in time just to drag my sorry, vodka-soaked self to safety. Ever since, I’ve had this tiny hope that if I recreate the exact scenario — same playlist, same brand of vodka, same blue hoodie I was wearing—I might unlock the same weird floor-bed time loop. So far? Nothing. Just a lot of blinking at the ceiling and then giving up and watching compilation videos of raccoons stealing cat food. But one day. One day, the magic might return. Or I’ll just accidentally invent teleportation by alcohol, who knows.",

  "I love this woman",
  "I remember being so excited when VH1 put on this song when i was abt 9.. i would jump and sing.. great days..",
  "So what exactly did she mean when she \"Wakes up in the morning feeling like P-diddy\"?🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔",
  "From Genius annotations: The song starts with the iconic statement where the speaker declares she “wake[s] up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy,” a famous rapper. Ke$ha, the author of the lyrics, takes pride in her country roots that have taught her how to tell a story through music, but the reason for placing this phrase as the opening of the song goes beyond mere chronological order. Much like George Orwell’s “all the clocks were striking thirteen” in 1984, the comparison between the speaker, a woman, and a rich black man is striking enough to set the tone for the rest of the song. This same tone of irony that makes everything seem out of place is what drives the underlying theme of the song, the duality of what is felt and what is expressed. The speaker is hung over from a night of late partying and wakes up confused, hazed, and feeling like a rap mogul instead of feeling like her true self. (and given her possibly hungover status, she’s even puffy, Diddy’s nickname) In an interview to Esquire, Ke$ha explains the literal, non-metaphorical meaning of her first line: One morning I just woke up, and I live in this house with I-don’t-even-know-how-many roommates – it’s this Laurel Canyon house with seven rooms and roommates fluctuating monthly […] Well it was the house The Eagles recorded Hotel California in. So it’s just this huge hippy… There are a bunch of hippies who come in and out, and there are all these people sleeping on the couches. I don’t really care, I don’t mind it. But I woke up one day after we went to a party, and I was surrounded by ten of the most beautiful women you’ve ever seen. And I was like, I’m like P. Diddy – there’s no man like this in the entire world. So that became the first line of the new single, and we just went from there.",
