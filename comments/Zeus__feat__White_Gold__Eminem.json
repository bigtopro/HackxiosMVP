The Force that counters gravity is gravity itself it\u0027s made up of uncondensed pieces and more condensed pieces and these more condensed pieces act like a liquid and can travel through the less condensed pieces .... That\u0027s how the gravitational field acts ... And most of the graviton acts like a ghost and the more condensed pieces can pass through the less condensed pieces but they can\u0027t leave the graviton ....(and to be clear that is because these little different condensed pieces in the field will collide and pull into one another and then pull in on other fields because there overwhelming pull now when the graviton is created it\u0027s made up of uncondensed pieces and more condensed pieces)... And the more condensed pieces will collide in the center of the graviton pushing and pulling on each other .. So the more condensed pieces will travel away from the center because of the collision with other pieces that are as condensed as them and the more condensed pieces pull on one another condensed pieces to pull them back to  collide in center back to collide with other condensed pieces ....giving you the spin in an electron because the graviton is spinning at 360 and so are all the little pieces there in a ball ..  that makes gravity You would get a virtual particles from the gravity field being different condensities... By the first field being inside the second field in the first field being different condensed little pieces that can travel through each other till they collide with something that\u0027s around the same condensity than they will start  pulling in more energy ...from around it\u0027s field until the particle gets big enough to get crushed by the second field which starts being pulled in by it because the first field becomes  condensed enough to interact with second field....",

  "Rap Contagion    [Chorus]  DJ scratching…    [Intro]  Rap is a disease. So please  Enjoy its bacteria. It’s k…lling ya.  Hip-hop Gs break trees and sell poison to enemies.  When you see the rocket you can’t stop it.  Rap is the best disease!    [Chorus]  DJ scratching…    [Verse 1]  Enjoy the rap contagion. It feels like clap, patient.  When you are ill you can’t live without conversation.  Degradation is a must, dude. Plus-plus, crews respect those who  Keep ignoring bugs. Boo the weak and then face the stronger one.  Fans go bonkers. Run and buy my album. I kick like Walker, man.  I think I deserve an Oscar. Done with haters. Ignoramus,  Go to your doctor. Rum boils my cold blood.  I will never mold. Shut the door and listen to my flow, rat.  I rap about feeding crows. Bat a thousand after leaving the house and  Try to earn dough. Mad like Max. Contagious tracks ain’t slow. Fat  Bass burns ears. I have no fear. Grow sad when I eat bread.  Sometimes I meet Dread who calls me a liar. Music is on fire.  I need lead to shoot demons. Rap fever makes me increase my speed. Lack  LA vibes. I fart every day. Fight pop vampires. Despise the mire.  I wanna play. Dice I roll burn on my way to skies.    [Chorus]  DJ scratching…    [Verse 2]  Forget about annoying choruses. They are useless like my diplomas. This  Sh…thole sucks when you have no bucks.  You become a hungry rocker. Diss fat coppers. List renewed.  Skunks boo rappers who try to get rich. Shut up, b…tch!  Your mouth is a punk’s loo. Conversation cancelled. Foot  The bill. Ready to drill walls. My rhymes ain’t run-of-the-mill. False.  I embody the rap rill. Cause heart attacks when I blast my tracks.  Peddle dill. Floors turn green. The sheen lost its sun rays.  When you face the bum days get dark. The maze I dwell in  Inspires me to love the haze. I banter-banter. Phase  Out the contagious weapon. You fear my nature. Step in  Step by step. Rap changes. Threaten suckers who steal wages. Sweating.  The battle ain’t over. Jonesing for fame. Doper songs I write  Can’t be lame. Mediocre rappers envy my flame. Joker  Is short on lame jokes and rots in Hell. Ring every bell.  Sober like Eminem. I’m ready. Damn the past. I cuss  And blame ya, fam.    [Chorus]  DJ scratching…    [Verse 3]  I can outrap Lil Pump when he makes a deal. Punk  You play is real. Drunk and delirious. Rap bacteria  Make you sh…t, skunk. When rap devil spits junk  Really stinks. Luck will not be nixed. Funk  I play in my car can fix luck. Use samples to win battles.  Go to hell, pricks! Stuck in the mud full of dirty toads.  The creatures become quirky. Ropes I learn  Are useful in the laundry. Hope my shorty knows  How to become curvy. Foes envy my wordy tropes.  Welcome to my laboratory! I will teach you  How to become a horror G. You should cause disorder. D  Knows how to steal a dollar. Feed inner werewolves  To contaminate water. See the future and butchers  Who slaughter Glee. Metaphorically, I imagine events  When I eat garlic. In dens, the generation can’t be happy. The mess  I cause is a bloody party. Detest melancholics who poison melons. Frolics  Get on my nerves. Life is like a lemon. Law nixed.  I slam doors like Onyx. Don’t freak me out. Shout at alcoholics.    [Chorus]  DJ scratching…    [Outro]  Please swallow Vitamin R. Please swallow Vitamin R.  Please swallow Vitamin R. Vitamin R, Vitamin R  Heals the spitter. The bar is my shelter. Rap is my helper.  I keep spitting. Stars fall from the sky. I try to hide vinegar. Mar  Your plans by dissing fans. Unforgiven and charred.  All I have is Vitamin R. It makes me omnipotent. Are  You okay? Throwing up the medicament. Spar  With inner demons. My rap fever can only be fixed by Vitamin R.  Recovery is imminent. Ha, ha, ha…  [Chorus]  DJ scratching…    © Norfum 2024.",

Just realize Wayne took drake from bird man to diddy n you know what diddy does to everyone he signs right? So why do you think diddy jumped drake n put him in the er and turned him to a part time body builder? Oh so you cooling with bird man but you too good to attend my parties? Yeah I think there’s deeper reasons why drake n Wayne fell out, push ups originally had shots at diddy in the leaked version that drake apparently took out the final take, maybe because he realized he felt so violated that letting his diddy beef come up at this time with everything surrounding diddy might take from his manhood.

  "\"A fighter\u0027s all I knew how to be, I got the shit beat out of me, tripped and fell and blew out a knee, popped it back in, and hopped up like fuck it, best two-out-of-three.\" This hit so hard. My parents abused me until my knees started dislocating daily and then neglected my medical care. They hid behind their badge to do it (child abuse prevention officer my ASS). I had to break out of the double-binds, Stockholm syndrome, gaslighting, and paper love to get myself to a surgeon and start surgical repairs that I wouldn\u0027t have needed if the abuse had been addressed 12 years sooner.  We all grow up, moms and dads. Be careful what you do while we\u0027re still weaker than you.  Our step dad was abusive. We weren\u0027t allowed to listen to Eminem, but my mom, brother and I would hide in a car in the parking lot outside the booksamillion in Hampton, Va and listen to his albums when they came out before giving the cd to Kodi (bro) to hide in his walkman. Started in 2000 when I was 8, bro was 11. My mom was a good mom until she became a cop. She wanted protection from her husband, but couldn\u0027t leave and support us on babysitting money. Being a cop served both purposes. I guess that made her so comfortable she forgot to look out for us, too. It changed her mental and priorities completely. With her on that fake image \u0027fear me\u0027 bullshit, real dad selling meth, abusive step dad trying to rub my knees/thighs in front of her, and a pedo grandpa enabled by an evil family, I chose Eminem to be my father from afar. Those memories in the parking lot are how I choose to remember my mom. She\u0027s still in there somewhere, but so deep that I can\u0027t reach her. I circled back 3 times to no avail. It\u0027s up to her to save herself now. I will stand by Em\u0027s strength and rage at disrespect to his covert moral compass being keystone to my survival. I learned more from Em that I even learned from my own family. I would give my life for Em, but not as a Stan; as a thank you for being my fire when the darkness came collecting souls like a fucking reaper. You will always be the GOAT, Em. ALWAYS.",

KRS1 and I used to wyle out. It was March madness week on Maui, I had hired KRS1 to the jewelry store I was restructuring and I needed her to fill my shoes a second location was coming, anyway long week we are looking to party. Hard Rock Cafe was having a decent band I forget who it was but it wasn\u0027t local. We were almost there and I was like wait I need a pack of parliaments. She like right, because doing drugs in a bathroom is a cardinal sin. I\u0027m like hahaha your look so sexy bringing this parliament to your nose on the dance floor. She giggles, I pay and we walk up the double doors of Hard Rock. I pay the cover,,, wait wait wait. How could I have forgotten to give a good description of KRS1 5 nothin long full sandy blond hair, big tits, can only order from Fredrick\u0027s big. But her hands bro, she had these tiny little delicate f*ing hand that just looked like they should always have a dick in them. She felt the same way... oh yeah how could I forget, a die hard born and raised new Yorker with the most distinct of all new York accents... This is the kind of bitch you kill for, hence \"now we do it to you\" v.s \"for Bessie we will\" yes this is that bitch. For me really m*ther f*cker that is the stupidest thing thats ever been said!!! I want to me!!! To me!!! Not for me!!! To me. Yeah that b*tch, my bitch, me Jesusa.(wink,wink) Ok so back to the story... we are walking to the bar and a group of basketball players walks up behind tall m*ther f*ckers and one of there reaches from behind in between us and grabs her tit. Before he can get his arm back to his body, I have buried my elbow so deep in his nasal socket, I have to pull to get my elbow back... now I\u0027m done yet... he bends forward in agony and I see behind him at the door is our most beloved beat cop, and both of his wing men. Officer Schlager,,, I scream Stu help!!! And this Nigha looks a Stu runs towards the bar, turns left and using one foot and a two top table jumps out of the bay window...

  "I CAN OUTRAP NAS AND DR DRE A Cup of Blood    [Intro]  A cup of blood, please…  A cup of blood, please…  A cup of blood, please…    [Verse 1]  Living in the mire, I f…cking feel tired.  No record deal. Fire burns my unreal desires.  That ordeal’s acquired. Lack meal. Hardwired  To self-deprecation. Frigging education  Is a piece of paper. I-I hate that information  Full of media lies, an ugly bully’s gibes…  Talents look like useless cookie files.  Goodie-goodies die under tons of despair.  Watching OnlyFans, I’m aware of bans.  I lose my hair. Clans wanna steal my footage.  They cause my foot itch. Gonna uproot rich  Trees and punish enemies. I’m in the mood, b…tch,  For banging you in the nook. Witch,  I’m cool like Snoop. Rich like LL Cool. Snitch  On me and you will be drowned in a deep brook, which  Means I’m a crazy maniac. When I get zany, Zuck  Blocks my account. Watch out! I can slay thee. Knock.  Slap your baby. Rap arouses her like a strong aphrodisiac.    [Chorus]  Blood is all I need-need….  Blood is all I need.    [Verse 2]  I’m a hungry vampire. When I see a campfire,  I k…ll poor people. It’s f…cking illegal.  I’m not a liar. I got fired because I put my coworkers into burning fire.  Parents call me Monster. Murdering is nonstop.  Even a rock star lost-lost blood. Then I floss. Rock  Houses and tear blouses. I do exhaust stars.  Sacking Hollywood is my f…cking hobby. Mood  Shines when a snobby look disappears.  Fear-fear shocks everybody. Sooks get snotty-snotty. Brooks  Become-come scarlet. The flesh is yum. Rockets  Fall on bums’ puppets. Meat is gum. Muppets  Try to undermine me. I banter-banter. Find me.  Your slander bites me. No cancer. Blimey.  My panther defies thee. Keep on acting wisely.  I can’t die. See my foes attacking my breed.    [Chorus]  Blood is all I need-need….  Blood is all I need.    [Verse 3]  I’m like Ned Stark. My-my heads bark  When you burn my bed. Shark  Slices your heads. Hark after the feds. Dark  Forests are my friends. Lark is my best-best spy.  Spooky feds die. Eat my next pie.  Truth can undress lies. Vamp never gets by.  I punish West. Cry and join my nest. Fly  Like jets. Buy only the best knives.  I love molesting wives. They like my vest. Dry  Husbands die. I’m the master. Bite greedy senators  For all debtors. Diss their letters. Bliss makes me  Crazy. My own bay seems vague. See demons  And Morgan Freeman. Lazy like rich Jay Z.  Ain’t saint-saint Swayze. Guns blazing. Blood is amazing.  Nipples resemble raisins. I turn grey. Sin  To feed, embracing darkness. I’m gonna park this  Car full of bad bodies. Drac-dracarys!  Blood-blood matters.    [Chorus]  Blood is all I need-need….  Blood is all I need.    [Outro]  No more sunshine-shine!  No more sunshine!    © Norfum 2023.",
