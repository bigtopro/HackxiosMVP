  "Thank you for singing my soul. A song for a song... this is mine:   Happy Since you’ve been gone I’m the brightest,  most glorious wreck… A ghost ship, sailing through the storms  of a life I don’t recognize. I wish I could tell you  That I haven’t cried, and I didn’t die inside… that my soul survived  and now it’s sunny and fine like the weather outside. I wish I can tell you that after all these years Pain faded away and I built a new life Happy and sane With the ruins left from my old self. I wish… I wish.. I wish I can wish it all away! I wish to find you… To grab you from the past and bring you here … But maybe the pain  of seeing me  like this, wrecked,  taking water in this insane storm, sails blown, gasping for air between colossal waves, hopeless, half gone, writing my song… would kill you. So, I’ll better leave you  there. Then. Happy.",

I hope that you somehow are able to cope and find the other side of grief.  This song will always punch me in the gut. I dunno how long it’s been for you, but I’ll share a little something that helps get me through (going on 3.5 years here since we lost her)…. Take all the good things about her and make sure you push them forward through the world. That’s how she lives on. My sister was so kind and generous and empathetic… so I make sure to carry that torch for her and I know that’s how we keep her here with us.  Much love ❤️",

  "I’m 16 and so full of grief. It consumes every single fiber of my being, hits me right through the core. I can never let go. I have loved and lost one too many times. They say grief is the price we pay for love, but I can never fully accept it; nor come to terms with it. What do you mean I’ll never get to see them ever again? Never get to talk to them? Feel their touch? And that all happens between a day and night. They’re here one moment, and then, just like that.. They’re gone. Can they hear me, or see me? Where are you? But the world kept on spinning. Even though it felt like _my_ world had stopped. And now, I’m forced to get back to my day to day life. To go to school, to force a smile, to talk to people. I can’t, but I have to. I’m numb, but I’m trying to feel, and this really helps me. Thank you, Imagine Dragons. And to anyone who’s grieving the loss of a loved one, my deepest condolences. I don’t know when, or where, but one day, we shall be reunited again.",

In many ways, we\u0027re total strangers. But despite that, we share something important: we’re both human. We both have feelings, emotions, and unique personalities that define who we are. And right now, we’ve both found ourselves here on YouTube, searching for sad songs, whatever the reason may be. If you\u0027re reading this, I want you to know—no matter what you’re going through, you will get through it,  and you will rise above it! There are people in your life who love you, even if it feels like they’re far away sometimes, they are worth holding on for. Yes, we may be strangers, but that doesn’t stop me from telling you that you\u0027re a wonderful person. I hope this message reaches you if you need to hear it today.

For the past seven years, your beautiful music has been a part of my life. I look forward to all the amazing work you’ll share in the future🤍",
  "My grandpa died of cancer, and my uncle ☠️ himself just before this song came out. This song came out on their funerals. We had them both the same day. I had just gone through the most traumatic thing to happen in my life just before this, but being safe, I cried a single tear, but because it was too much to handle emotionally, and I put all my willpower in my schoolwork, I chose to block myself off from my feelings, and push myself into my work. I feel it today though, and I can\u0027t stop thinking about them, and the other people I lost around the same time. Now I give myself permission to cry at night.",

  "Today marks one month since my girlfriend passed away due to cancer, only 32 years. Due to medical negligence, we were unaware that her breast cancer had evolved into a brain metastasis, and we only found out when she started experiencing headaches and was intubated. Unfortunately, it was too late for treatment, and she suffered brain death. The pain is immense; I think about her every day when I wake up and when I go to bed, that is, when I can sleep. She also left behind a 6-year-old son. I love Imagine Dragons, and whenever they come to Brazil, I attend their shows. When Dan Reynolds talks about taking care of those we love, from now on, I will always remember her with much love and affection.",
  "I feel overwhelmed with tears listening to this song. When I was 3yrs old, I remember my mom making me play at the playground and then she was teaching me how to be a good girl like avoid playing with soil, so I won\u0027t catch worms or not to sprain myself... Since I was so naughty they made me talk to a lil Russian kid who\u0027s father was a doctor. They taught me lessons on proper upbringing of your body. I got so scared of him but sometimes I thought he was scared of me too because I was scared of him Lol... What butt heads. When I learned my lessons, we bid him goodbye and convinced him to move to America to return the favor. We thought they were really good folks that I owed them my 36-26-36 \"Ivana\" body type that maybe they\u0027ll like the American friends my mom used to have from the states when she was still working there. But then, we bid him goodbye an my mom left him a message \"If you\u0027re already in America, don\u0027t forget about us alright?\"☺️ He bid back. I looked up to him since then. ☺️❤️ Nice folks",

When suicide is the only way to take away the pain inside. Ive studied and taught numerous classes on suicide, so dont frign comment its a coward way out. Your clueless!!! My life hinges on egg shells. I raised 3 great children, loved their mom with all of me, yet she still just asked for a divorce. Why???? 😢😢. I\u0027m still fighting every minute to stay around. Will I keep on fighting the fight, dont have that answer. Chester understood this more than most. Go find his interview on depression and mental illness. Godbless all who are in this kind of fight.

  "RIP my love, I can\u0027t wait to join you. Besides Mama Dukes, I think you might be the only person that ever truly loved me. I\u0027ve seen your soul in the eyes of animals. I\u0027ve tried to replace you with other women who didn\u0027t give af about me, and I let them take advantage of me just because they\u0027d occasionally remind me of you. But there is no other you. I will find you again at the end of a pole when mama dies, I promise.  ... I don\u0027t know if any of these fantasies are real, I doubt it. But if they are, I hope it\u0027ll be like those books you sent me in prison. I hope it\u0027ll be like a Valhalla for us where it\u0027s a war with us against the world again. I hope you can\u0027t see me like this though. Especially the last few years, I\u0027ve been especially broken since the last decade. Getting clean wasn\u0027t all we thought it would be, and there won\u0027t be any children that can continue our legacy. My veins are gone, health is at a breaking point, and there\u0027s nothing left for me to give or take, because I am *completely* on my own, just hanging on for the sake of Mama dukes sanity... But my last defiant words will be \"F××× you!\" Just like Daves probably was before they killed him. Until then, if it\u0027s possible tell all the others I miss them too. ... I love you then, now, and forever... And your smile, words, blood, perfume, Irish/Italian body, crazy B×××× moments, and letters have never been forgotten...🖤",

  "I\u0027ve lost so many loved ones who were key to my life, one by one until it felt so much emptier, losing those who knew and loved me best and who I loved best from my childhood. Both parents, a brother, my aunts. But the one that hit the hardest and messed me up the most was my first grand daughter at 4yrs old. I just layed in bed most of a few years, so broken. I lost all these people within a few years. So brutal.  One day I was driving down the road and I had a memory, a strong memory like I was there, reliving it. In this memory my family was gathered in a beautiful meadow, my granddaughter was there, and we were all gathered at her gravestone. Heaven was having a blow out celebration because she had been promoted or graduated to something that was a big deal for her and that she worked really hard and long to achieve, and we were all there to celebrate with her, it was like a ceremony and then she would be in the new place doing some kind of amazing job she\u0027d always wanted in a next level. We were all happy for her.  It was like this was where my consciousness went. When I came back to this reality, it was like that was real and this life didn\u0027t happen, then I slowly started to remember how it happened here and that it was utterly devastating for my daughter, her husband and other grand daughters, and myself. But it was the beginning of a slow trickle of healing. A healing I didn\u0027t think would ever come. And may not have without that vision/ memory.",

  "The first time I heard this song, i had my headphones on, listening to music, while i cleaned my house. I started sobbing!! My big brother and i were best friends. We were 3.5 years apart. We had gotten into a huge fight the week before because i started dating someone he knew was not a good guy and forbid me to see him. It was a really bad fight. That weekend, my mom found us a place to move to. Prior to this we were all staying with different friends because we had been displaced. My brother and his friends helped us move into the house on Saturday. My brother took me aside, hugged me and told me he loved me, i did tell him that i loved him too. We had never done this after any other fight we had. This was before cell phones and we hadn\u0027t gotten the phone turned on yet. My brother asked if he could stay with his friends that night. My mom agreed and told them all that we would be by to take them all out to dinner for helping us a d then my brother was going to move in. He was moving in to help my mom with rent and help me get through some traumatic things i had already gone through. My mom and i got to my brothers friends house and there was a note on the door to meet them at the hospital. My brother and his friends fiance had gone to the grocery store a block and a half away earlier in the evening. On the way home, while making a left onto their street, the little Triumph car my brothers fiance was driving was hit by a motor home. My brother was killed on impact and his friends fiance died the next day. My brother died 5/15/88, 36 years ago today, at the age of 18. He always said he was going to take care of my mom, so, when he passed, that responsibility fell on me. My mom has always been a constant in my life. As she got older, she needed some help. She moved in with me 7.5 years ago. In October last year, my mom got diagnosed with terminal cancer. Shr said she was tired and wanted to be with my brother and i completely understood that because i have not gotten over losing him either. My mom passed away on 4/12/24, in our home, surrounded by everyone she loved. I cry because I\u0027m in pain and i miss them but I\u0027m so happy they are together again ❤",

My Dad was 60 years of age who lost his battle to a horrendous disease, please men out there, don\u0027t hesitate to get your prostate checked when the time comes, be mindful of it in you\u0027re 40\u0027s and into your 50\u0027s. Women, please encourage your partners/husbands to go and get checked.  Here in the UK and around the world there needs to be much more awareness of the most common type of cancer in men. What a song I must say, me and my Dad listened to many songs by Imagine Dragons, all I can say to them is thank you very much.  Grief is such a strange thing, coming up to 6 months after my Dad\u0027s passing things are still quite raw, but some days I\u0027ll smile and then I\u0027ll cry it\u0027s hard to explain.

I obviously don\u0027t follow imagine dragons much, I have quite a handful of their songs, but Imagine Dragons just won me over as a way bigger fan. The amount of realness and emotion in this song, it is a POWERFUL and very very beautifully created song. This truly is art. The vocals blew my mind. And I watched the live version and that blew me away as well.",

  "Possible interpretation: The song \"Wrecked\" seems to express deep sadness and longing after the loss of someone dear. The lyrical self reflects on the moments shared and the influence of the person who has passed away. The lyrics describe how the days pass, but the pain of loss persists. The lyrical self feels destroyed and wishes the loved one was back. There is a feeling of guilt and regret for not having enjoyed the moments together more. The song also mentions the words of encouragement that the deceased person used to give, reminding the lyrical self to move on, even if it is difficult. In short, \"Wrecked\" is an emotional song that deals with the pain of loss and the desire to keep the memory of the loved one alive. It expresses the feeling of emptiness and sadness that can accompany loss and the difficulty of moving on.",

  "Lost my mom to cancer last year when I was 19, I\u0027m still in college. This song really speaks to me because after she passed, it\u0027s like I became a different person. My grades started slipping, I started sleeping around and getting into alcohol and drugs. Things I never would have done before. I just wish I would have been able to talk to her one last time, because chemo really messed her head up in her last days. My flight back home was late and she passed while I was on the plane, every day I think about what I could have done differently to show her that I loved her because I never had the chance. When I heard this song in the car, I started bawling, the first time I\u0027ve cried since she passed. It might sound cheesy, but I\u0027ve been listening to Imagine Dragons religiously since I was in elementary school, and this is the one that really has inspired me to turn my behavior around, because I know what I\u0027m doing isn\u0027t what she would have wanted. I miss you, mom. Thank you, Imagine dragons, for inspiring me my whole life.",

  "This song... It sounds like what I would of written for ariya.... My fiance, my soulmate, got raped and pregnant.. convinced her to keep the baby since I can\u0027t have kids.... We tried for 2 years.   She went insain. Took her life and the life of my unborn son. I  held her as she bled out.  Screaming for help on the phone with the police dispatch  The paramedics got there too late.  They couldn\u0027t save her or the unborn life.  This song brought me to tears.  That pain from those days.... That never faded and honestly, the part where he says what she would say, that sounds a lot like what ariya would\u0027ve told me.   \"Promise me you will not lose hope, you will carry on. Don\u0027t lose your hope dreams or love, don\u0027t throw your life away\" As she used to tell me, for may the stars guide you, as the moon shines upon a brighter tomorrow.",

I didn\u0027t think it would effect them the way it did, but it brought tears to both of them. Neither of them have experienced this kind of a loss so I didn\u0027t think it would do anything. But it just goes to show what an awesome writer you are when you can replicate your feelings in someone else.  Truly these words say exactly how I feel now and I\u0027m sure how I will feel 10 years from now. I will see you again Robert, my loved one.",

  "As Reynolds previously revealed, “Wrecked” was inspired by the singer’s late sister-in-law Alisha Durtschi Reynolds, who died following a cancer battle; a tribute to Alisha is shown at the  end of the Matt Eastin-directed video. “She was the brightest light. A beacon of joy and strength for everyone she met. Her sudden passing has shaken me in ways that I still am unable to express,” Reynolds had said in a statement. “I was with her and my brother when she passed, and it was the first time in my life that I had witnessed death in this way. It sealed into my mind the fragility of life and finality of this all. I’ve watched my brother face something that no one should have to. But I’ve also seen his faith bring him hope in a future with her. I can only hope for the same.” Reynolds continued. “This song was my way of dealing with it all, as music has always been my refuge. No longer being a man of fervent faith, I can only hope that she hears it somewhere in a place where she is healed and no longer in pain. This song is my wish for an eternity with those that I love.”",
  "O Dan foi tão genial nessa ... uma das minhas favoritas S2",

He was the same age as Dan\u0027s late sister-in-law. I can\u0027t stop listening to this song, it perfectly describes how I feel... \"Wishing you were around, but now it\u0027s too late. My mind is a place that I can\u0027t escape your ghost.\" I feel numb and struggle to do everyday things, he\u0027s always on my mind.

I discovered Avril Lavigne two years ago, I was just kicked out of school for futile reasons, my parents always raged and fought with each other since I was born. I lost almost all my friendships. At that point, I was losing my grip, not for joke, I never asked for help to a therapist. My only friend is a fan of her and he used to say her name really often. Then I started to listen to her music. I found her music when I really needed it. I think she saved my life. Listen to Take Me Away and the whole album Under My Skin and Let Go.",

  "I know the pain you\u0027re feeling,,,  and it\u0027s ok to be vulnerable and confused , not knowing what to do,   the reason I say this is because my first wife was raped and killed while I was at work,  ( post mortem rape).  My second wife was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Shortly after covid came around and they literally had to watch her fade away, she was losing weight at an incredible pace, and one morning on August the 13th which was a Friday in 2021 I woke up kissed a good morning and I asked her what she wanted to eat from the store and as soon as I left,,, she must have passed away minutes after I had stepped out of the door, because Returned about 10 minutes,  she pretty much choked in her own blood . And when I tried to perform CPR on her she was still somewhat warm... So I can definitely relate to your pain and how you feel,,,  and only thing I can tell you is you got to be strong,,,, you have to think of how she would want you to live your life,,, you can\u0027t give up,,,  unfortunately it is events like this that make a stronger and make us who we are today,,,,everyday I grieve for both of the women that I truly loved and lost,,, but I keep your memory alive in my heart,,, I know it\u0027s going to be hard but you have to hold your head up you have to be strong and time does heal all wounds,,,, if you ever need to let some steam off and talk,,,, you can always hit me up",

The happiest and saddest moments of my life rolled into One. God and the devil, angels and demons all watching that drama play out. No amount of my promises or tear filled begging to the Heavenly realm could stop her from leaving me. She was only 37………Nika “Victory”…..the only gift I need from God if I’m worthy of one is to see her smile at me again in Heaven.",

So i feel your pain. I too hope to one day again see her beautiful smile. Please take care. Cheers.",

Everyone I have met since that day has heard her name. Nika It means victory and that woman was victorious, intelligent and beautiful. I have been with several women since she left but no one can touch her memory.  Before she died she told me that I was a good man and that I should get past the loss and allow myself to love again but her memory is always a stumbling block for me.",

On January 8th, he had sent a message to my son (his father saying he was missing him). My son only noticed the message on January 11th. But then, according to the police department, he might have already been dead. So, he never received the first message of his son in 2023.... My hear and soul are broken for him because he was alone and did not look for us for help.",

  "This song is so true. It\u0027s exactly how I feel about losing the love of my life. I have loved her since the first time I saw her. We didn\u0027t know we both felt the same about each other for years. Finally, fate brought us together 32 years later, and we shared with each other how we both felt of each other. We got married, only for 6 years, until she passed away on Christmas day 12/25/22 from health complications. I lost my best friend, my love, my wife, and what matters most in life. She was my everything. I know to meet her again. I must live life and try to make her proud. I looked forward to meeting her again. She was and is my one and only true love forever. Rest in Peace Shalan until we meet again, yours for eternity.  I\u0027m not a person that cries easy, but this song hits me so hard I can\u0027t help but think of my wife and tear up. Thank you for such a meaningful song.",

  "That guilt that you feel when you lose someone you truly love (and it\u0027s not just \"blood family\" that you\u0027re supposed to love)and you can\u0027t even cry because the pain goes so much deeper that that. People say you\u0027re hard, people say you don\u0027t care just because you don\u0027t show your pain. Not everyone understand that sometimes people CAN\u0027T show their pain, because that\u0027s the way they\u0027re made, because they process grief in other ways, some self destructive, some self improving, but still they expect you to cry and be depressed all the time when in reality they don\u0027t know that maybe you can\u0027t sleep at night because you\u0027re remembering that particular moment with your loved one and you don\u0027t want to let it go, you don\u0027t want to sleep, you don\u0027t want to forget, you just want to be... back then. I\u0027m sorry Dan and and all your family for your loss, I understand. I hope you understand that I understand. All my love.",

  "- To live in a modern society, it is important to overcome differences and find something in common. Such as America and Russia. We survived the Cold War because we were able to look at each other as people. I think this is the key to the future. Now the world can be very evil. We exclude, throw out those who are not like us. We are building walls. In my understanding, America is now very confused and is going in the wrong direction. And I\u0027m trying to show that it\u0027s possible in a different way. James Cameron.

  "This song reminds me of one of my sisters. When I was about seven I lost my first dog named Sam, she was a German shepherd, on the day we had to put her down my parents and my other sisters stayed in the clinic to watch. That sister was my fav at the time and she had took me to the car, I constantly heard her crying. Ever since she had a baby she shut me and my family out. I still remember when that child smiled at me for the first time. I was about 8 when that happens and he wasn’t even one yet and here it’s been about two or three years and I am eleven. I haven’t seen her nor that baby since then. My oldest nephew recently had a birthday party and that sister asked the one that shut my fam out if she was gonna bring her kid and she just ignored her. She does not know of how much emotional damage she has done to me and a lot to my dad. No madder how you’re feeling imagine dragons has a song for you. LONG LIVE IMAGINE DRAGONS!",

I had to cut ties because she became toxic and horrible due to her mental health and abusive parents. No matter how much my family and I tried to help her, even moving her away from her parents into our house she treated us like shit. She was a living embodiment of \"The abused becomes the abuser\" and I just couldn\u0027t take it anymore. I still love her so much but she just isn\u0027t who I became friends with anymore.

Wanted to join the army or police, now I\u0027m thinking about getting my right leg voluntairily amputated. With 22 years.  I\u0027m grieving for the joy that left my life, that got replaced by the clarity you have after you nearly died.  I find myself wrecked more often then I wish I\u0027d do. I wanted to do something meaningful, being strong, sportive and just bursting from being alive. Now, I am only able to train my brain bc my body is aching, destroyed, chronicly ill. I will never feel the joy of bringing your body to it\u0027s limits again.  I\u0027m grieving for the life I had.",

I felt terrible, as if I wasn\u0027t crying or being emotional when I was supposed to. A year later I\u0027m done with high school living on my own...and I break down...I was a complete wreck. Ever since then it never has gotten better. But I\u0027ve realized that sucking it up isn\u0027t what needs to be done. When I need to cry, cry. When I need to scream, scream. But never forget and never regret. I miss her so much and it never lessens or gets better. And that\u0027s okay. It\u0027s okay to not be okay. She was such a big part in my life, and I never realized that until she was gone. If anyone here is going through this pain, please hear my words. You are going to be okay.  This person you\u0027ve lost, they will always be watching over you. No matter how hard it gets please don\u0027t ever give up. We\u0027re in this together, you and me...all of us.

  "This hit me today. It\u0027s been almost 2 years since I lost my brother. I see ppl that squander their lives and I hate them. It\u0027s eating me alive slowly. My sister in law showed up at my door. All I could say was  why the fuck are u here. I finally said fuck it and told her how I have felt for so long and told her I don\u0027t give a fuck what her excuses are. She always has an excuse, it\u0027s always someone else\u0027s fault, she\u0027s handed so many opportunities to get right and she squanders them. I told her she didn\u0027t deserve it, but my brother did. He was hard working, worked hard to get right after messing up cuz he had a lot of trauma from living a hard life. A shit start was handed him but he was strong and he fought his depression and fought to deal with his emotions, worked to make the life he wanted and our father took from us. And on his way to work he was tired we are assuming and he didn\u0027t see a truck in front of him with a trailer breaking. He realized it too late. I went to the scene and you could see the police spray and the gouges in the asphalt from his motorcycle being layed down. He tried but it was too late and he hit head-on into the end of the trailer. He was a good father raising his two daughters and stepson with his fiance. He\u0027d finally found the love of his life. They had plans. He was happier than I had ever seen him. In an instant he was gone. And I hate others whom I feel fuck off their lives. I\u0027d trade them from my brother anyday. He was better than hundreds of fuckoffs put together .",

Military families know the heaviness of loss of life and the responsibility you have to make sure that everyone is ok. The loss of a friend, a mentor, a role model and someone that would take a bullet for you, I know that sounds aweful but I don\u0027t know how else to describe someone that would go out in front of you like that to make sure all was clear never feels any less. It doest go away or get better just bc it was a part of the job.  I\u0027ve never met anyone else like him that would look out for you and your family. The lyrics to this song remind me of that kind of  love. \"I\u0027ll see you again my loved one\" In my mind, we are singing to him how much we appreciate the time we had with him and we can mourn the loss of the love that was felt on Sept 2nd, 2006 and  still to this day. Thank you for this song ❤️",

So I asked if she wanted to end things... and she said yes. So now I\u0027m here, thinking about all the wonderful things that matter so much to me and once mattered to her.",

  "When I was born my dad tried to drown me to hurt my mom. My mom and her entire family made every waking day hell for me. My step dad was very nice when he wasn’t groping me. I only had my little black dog , Blacky. We where inseparable…..  she’d walk with me to school and pick me up then we’d go to the corner store 2 small bags of hot Cheetos 1 for each of us and a coke each. We’d sit on the curb and she’d listen to me about how I got bullied at school and at home. She was so so smart. She’d never go in the house only in my room through my window and only from 11pm til 5 am . We did everything together and she always tried to intervene when people would attack me. She never was leashed always stayed off the street and crossed only when other ppl crossed.. this one night was different, she ran into the street and immediately got run over by a red suv right in front of me I was 9 years old. I held her in my arms in the middle of the street as she took her last breaths. I dug her grave I lowered her in I planted her a garden and I tried to go with her (I alive myself) so many times. I’m 30 years old now. I have her bones in my room since my mom sold the house. I talk to her and cry all the time. This song reminds me of the only family an friend I ever had. I miss her so much I just want to close my eyes and be with her again at least  for 1 more day. She should have met my daughter, she didn’t even get to meet my daughter…. Rest In Peace Blacky aka my Wooshnika  I’ll always remember you.  I’ll always want to be with you.",

  "this song was played at my dad\u0027s funeral.  He was only 52 years old and died of a brain tumor 6 months after finding out.  The past months before the diagnose we were in a big fight over stupid buisness stuff. (family buisness)  And i almost never visited him after the diagnose because i thought he would pull through and i was angry.  My grandfather died the year before because of lung cancer. but he lasted 20 years after the diagnose.  I thought it would be the same for my dad. God was i wrong.  Many regrets , all to late.  My mom and brother did all the caring, i did shit. Almost nothing. Just went on working as hard as i could.  I\u0027ve never been so wrong.  I hope someone reads this and doesn\u0027t make the same mistakes as me. All this song makes me do is cry. and full with guilt.  Now, 6 months later. the buisness is going great. But it will never be the same. edit 2 years later (march 7 2025, you\u0027re birthday):  Buisness going better then ever.  I\u0027ve met the woman of my dreams. We have a son together.  Last week i was just cruising around on my motorcycle and for a split second i thought , i will come to you\u0027re house and we can ride together. That would be cool. After that split second , i realised.  I\u0027m so sorry. You where my whole world for every second you where here.  i hope i see you again dad \u003c3",

Eventually I grew out of it but when I kept hearing Enemy on the radio I found out imagine Dragons, my favorite band when I was 5 had made it I started to listen to their new album. Without a doubt the first time I heard this song I fell in love with it. I could relate to it so much, because of my very old dog who had died at the age of 12. The way they sing it… it’s just so amazing. Now I know for sure this is the best band. :D",

I couldn\u0027t move on. I can\u0027t move on.  Really, sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day my baby.... I wish you were inside me just \u0027one more day\u0027 .....

  "Listened to this yesterday and I\u0027ve simply fallen in love with it! One of the best songs I\u0027ve listened to. Only after watching the end of this video did I learn that it was about death and losses. That doesn\u0027t change the song\u0027s beauty though. If anything, this song teaches me to love and value those who are important in my life, as losing a loved one is so hurtful. I lost my grand-aunt last year and it was the first time that death hit me in my life. My grand-aunt, whose name was Maltilde, was a person who marked my childhood and impacted it in so many positive ways. I remember when she\u0027d make me food every time I went to her house as a child. It really really hurt. I am very shy and had never said \"I love you\" to my mom, but after listening to this song, I was so overwhelmed by its message that I decided to overcome my shyness and tell her I love her. She\u0027s one of the most important people in my life and I love her from the bottom of my heart. There are tears coming out of my eyes as I write this. Thank you so much, Imagine Dragons, for writing such a beautiful and well thought of song. Enjoy your time with those you love, because you never know when they\u0027ll be gone. Also always make sure to value the important things in life. Love from Brazil!",

Ela faleceu lentamente por meses, aquilo me matou lentamente junto com ela a cada dia de sofrimento. Sentia como se estivesse sofrendo o dobro do que já tinha sofrido quando perdi minha mãe. Era como se eu sofresse por mim e por minha filha junto, depois descobri que tudo que eu estava sentindo era real, eu deixei de ignorar meus sentidos, agora sei que eu absorvi todos os sentimentos da minha filha para ela não sofrer, e isso quase me matou de verdade, não por achar que era da minha cabeça, mas fisicamente. Eu não sei como é apos a morte, mas tenho uma certeza tão grande quanto a certeza da morte. Nossa consciência continua existindo.

I decided not to go because i had been drinking and was just really ..... feeling. was around 9pm! I regret not driving now anyway! she got there mabey 30  minutes before my brother, watching and loving him in his last moments, my brother walked in as he passed away!

Im sorry for you about your dad! just know it will be easier to deal with over time! youll think of him often it will always kinda be sad but kinda enlightening when you let it be positive! you will eventually make room emotionally to just hold onto the best things you can and worst as well,  while growing yourself from the experience of loss of your father and other loved ones unique stories we all have to tell!! but they make us who we are!",

We can see each other three times a year, and every time we have to say goodbye again and know it\u0027ll be a couple of months until we can lie in each other\u0027s arms again it\u0027s painful as f*ck. The first days after having been separated again are always the worst, and parts of those songs do summarise that feeling quite well. I do feel like a wreck during those days.

(Our) dogs, Jaq (Jack) \u0026 Brooke have literally, \u0027held my hand\u0027 these two years now since I last spoke with Joe, while he was alive.  The dogs have been my comforters - almost nurses, counselors.  Each time I feed them, put them to bed at night, and play with them throughout the day I remember Joe.  His presence is felt in an extraordinary way.  Silence.  Peace.  Silence.  Music.  Silence.  Dance.  Almost, as if in a trance (at times)...I see and enjoy Joe\u0027s presence.  \u0027Joe, I\u0027m not afraid, but it has been difficult.  The garden, where you sat in the mornings, is beautiful. Growing.  A true memorial to you, to life eternal.  It is a testimony to our love together on this earth, and beyond.

He was always full of joy and kept all of us laughing for hours every chance he got. It breaks my heart to know all of us couldn\u0027t be there for him when he needed us to be or never let us notice what he went through when he was alone. This song brings in all his memories rushing back and reminds me to tell people how dangerous and devastating bottling up sadness can be to you. Please reach out to close ones before its too late because one different choice you make can destroy all the lives that cared equally for you too. Please find help before you give up on a life that could\u0027ve been a beautiful one. Love to everyone that\u0027s suffering, I hope life will turn around for you.

  "Honestly, I never comment on videos, but this is an exception and the situation calls for it, I need to vent. This song has a special meaning for me, it is an emotional song that Imagine Dragon released just when I broke up with my first girlfriend, with whom I had been with for almost 6 years. I was \"Wrecked\" at the time and this song probably has her name on it. However, today I am not writing for this. Yesterday, while I was preparing to go to the Imagine Dragons concert in Santiago (Spain) and fulfill a dream, my beautiful dog Nala passed away due to a tumor. We adopted her 9 years ago, a dog that had just given birth and that nobody wanted because of her age and because she had leismania. When we saw her, she conquered the hearts of my family and mine. His departure destroys my soul and the only thing that saved me yesterday from the moment was the performance of Imagine Dragons Today I´m \"Wrecked\", but if Imagine Dragons has taught me anything, it\u0027s that \"it\u0027s okay not to be okay\", but that you have to move on, despite everything. This song, as well as my heart, will always be yours Nala. I know that we have given you the best possible life and that you were happy, I am proud of it.",

I did not know where to turn but I knew she was hurting far worse than I was. I convinced myself to pray for her and for us and be patient. None of that was easy but a year later things are better but not what I would like. She will never be the same person again just as you will never be the same person again.

  "The Rapture For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and those who died in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. 1 Thessalonians 4:16,17. Have you heard about the return of Jesus Christ and are you also prepared for this event that will mark the final moment of history? All the prophecies described by Jesus in his ministry are being fulfilled as great signs in the heavens, famines, wars, pestilences and earthquakes everywhere, which indicate that his coming is already near. The Rapture of the Church of Jesus (every saved person, whether Jew or Gentile, will be taken from the earth) will bring a sudden, dramatic, and unimaginable blow to the history of humanity left behind. This revolutionary event will trigger a series of other subsequent events. Like the appearance of Antichrist and the 7 years of great Tribulation on Earth. And even if we do not reach the day of his return, we must be prepared so that if we die, we will be sure to be resurrected on that day. For that, we have to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Only and Sufficient Savior of our lives, and so we have an encounter with him and obtain the salvation of our soul. So make your choice, accept Jesus right now, ask forgiveness for your sins and be sure of eternal life. I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live. Deuteronomy 30:19 R.M WOULD YOU LIKE TO ACCEPT JESUS ​​AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR ?",

It’s generally used in hospitals ONLY, under a physician’s supervision, like for major surgery, not for at home use",

I lost my father 17 years ago. 2 weeks after my 14th birthday. His death has haunted me for almost 2 decades because I was his babygirl. His last words, 8 months before the wreck, were \"I love you, babygirl\", to which I replied \" I hate you. I hope you fucking die\". I was an angry 14 year old kid because my parents had just gotten divorced after 21 years of marriage, and my father was in active addiction at the time, and at the time of his death. But he was my everything. These lyrics definitely made me stop and give this song another chance, and now I\u0027m sitting here in tears while holding the watch that he was wearing when he died. 😭",

But it hurted a lot and everytime I remember her I cry a lot. My parents decided to end her suffering at the moment that the leishmaniasis was that bad that she didn\u0027t wanted to eat and couldn\u0027t even get up without help.

Yet there’s something about this song that so accurately captures the inner turmoil and grief and agony and guilt. I miss him everyday even though I no longer cry every minute of every hour.  It’s ok to keep moving forward and hate it without them and appreciate those still here and grief isn’t just a one line quote. It’s everything. It’s the absolute worst thing we face and yet we can find peace along with all the pain we continue to forever carry.",

En uno de los casos es Sunflower de Postmalone la canción que escuche en bucle mientras volviamos del velorio. En el otro caso Fue Wrecked, situaciones ditintas canciones diferentes pero mismo sentimiento. Desde ese entonces me he sentido como dice la canción wrecked y  me sigue pasando que estoy hablando con gente y me desasparezco. Esta canción ha descipto como me siento desde entonces. Lo unico que me ayuda algunzas veces a tanquilizarme es recordar, porque las memorias son lo unico que nos queda, y es lo unico que realemnte es nuestro.",

Включая джаз и оперу. Последними были Muse. Но мощь этой вещи Драгонов меня просто убила. Я как ребёнок реву, слушая каждый раз. Впитываю каждое слово. Боже, как далеко пошла музыкальная культура...

After that moment, after the funeral, afterwards, all along I\u0027ve been constantly convincing myself that it\u0027s natural, \"people would eventually pass away\", so don\u0027t cry, don\u0027t be dramatically saying how I miss him or something. But upon hearing this song, it instantly untied the knot. I realized deep down I actually miss him so very much and recall the memory when I heard the message. My first reaction was \"It can\u0027t be. One more week, no, one more day, after the midterm, I\u0027ll go straight to your place to visit you one last time.\" This song actually helped me face my great grandfather\u0027s death in a more healthy way.",

They captured the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. They want to capture the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv. They also fire on residential areas. Many civilians have already died, including children. We need the world to know that Russia has started a war with Ukraine, no one is helping us, neither America nor Europe, everyone is afraid that Putin will start a nuclear war.

I tried to listen other songs to dilute its hold on my mind, but it just dont fade away. and all of a sudden, I see something, that reminds me of him, and i remembered, i have been seeing this thing since past few days repeatedly. It is not something so common to appear every now and then, but i have been seeing this, over and over again, and now this song is stuck in my mind. May be this song is just my subconcious telling me that i miss him, or im not over him. I dont feel this song though, but I wanna listen to it, I feel like crying when I saw this video, but I still dont relate to it. then why I wanna listen to it over and over? why the comment section of this video has that thing that reminds me of him?  I dont know the reason, I dont wanna know, Im good without him, im much better being left alone, away from his presence. I cannot let my mind get a hold over me, I cannot let my mind go against me. Im not wrecked without you vivek, Im happy, its your time to levae my mind, the way you left me over and over, every time!",

  "LYRICS \"Days pass by, and my eyes, they dry, and I think that I\u0027m okay \u0027Til I find myself in conversation, fading away The way you smile, the way you walk The time you took to teach me all that you had taught Tell me, how am I supposed to move on? These days I\u0027m becoming everything that I hate Wishing you were around, but now it\u0027s too late My mind is a place that I can\u0027t escape your ghost Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away One more rainy day without you Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day One more rainy day Oh, I\u0027m a wreck without you here Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck since you\u0027ve been gone I\u0027ve tried to put this all behind me I think I was wrecked all along Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves The way you laugh when your shoulders shook The time you took to teach me all that you had taught Tell me, how am I supposed to move on? These days I\u0027m becoming everything that I hate Wishing you were around, but now it\u0027s too late My mind is a place that I can\u0027t escape your ghost Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away One more rainy day without you Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day One more rainy day Oh, I\u0027m a wreck without you here Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck since you\u0027ve been gone I\u0027ve tried to put this all behind me I think I was wrecked all along These days when I\u0027m on the brink of the edge I remember the words that you said \"Remember the life you led\" You\u0027d say, \"Oh, suck it all up, don\u0027t get stuck in the mud Thinking of things that you should have done\" I\u0027ll see you again, my loved one I\u0027ll see you again, my loved one Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck I\u0027ll see you again, my loved one Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck without you here (I\u0027m a wreck without you here, loved one) Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck since you\u0027ve been gone (I\u0027m a wreck since you\u0027ve been gone) I\u0027ve tried to put this all behind me I think I was wrecked all along (I\u0027m a wreck) Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away (But I can\u0027t) One more rainy day without you (One more rainy day) Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day (But I can\u0027t) One more rainy day\" ~ from genius.com",

Earned money doing hard work.  Never enjoyed them with his own earn money. My goal was to make him proud. Every I checked his pressure and diabetic level and always took care. My goal my dream everything shuttered down on 18th february 2022. 3-4 years I also never enjoyed anything and even any festival just prayed nothing happen to him and my mom.

I have a few loved ones who have passed and I can feel them when I let myself. I hope this brings you some comfort-- I read it often:  Death is nothing at all. It does not count. I have only slipped away into the next room. Nothing has happened. Everything remains exactly as it was. I am I, and you are you, and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged. Whatever we were to each other, that we are still. Call me by the old familiar name. Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. Put no difference into your tone. Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow. Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together. Play, smile, think of me, pray for me. Let my name be ever the household word that it always was. Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it. Life means all that it ever meant. It is the same as it ever was. There is absolute and unbroken continuity. What is this death but a negligible accident? Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight? I am but waiting for you, for an interval, somewhere very near, just round the corner. All is well. Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost. One brief moment and all will be as it was before. How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again! ~Henry Scott Holland",

Sending this out into the universe, until we meet again, my heart will ache…the aura of you is entrenched within my everything but its ok as that is how I’ll be sure it’s you even if the body is unfamiliar, I know I’ll still recognize “you”.

  "I honestly thought the song would massively eclipse the music video but damn it didn’t disappoint. Everything about this piece of media is phenomenal— from the cinematography to the underlying meaning. Love the song but I might just love the music video more. Edit: Okay so a month down the line and every time I listen to this song it just gets better and better. While the music video is great, I’ve noticed it feels a bit incomplete at times, there could’ve been more interpretation, better visual but it’s hands down one of the better music videos. The emotions are shown greatly. I really do hope they make more songs like this rather than the growing-old stadium-chant feeling. This song just rips at your heart over and over and it’s phenomenal.",

A partner or lover, a family member, a friend or just somebody that used to be part of your life. I’ve lost my mom in 2016 and this song just describes our relationship so perfectly good. “How am I supposed to move on without her?” But then again this song gives me power to actually move on. For her. Because she would’ve wanted me to. And yes, sometimes I wish to see her one more day. And I will. One day I will see her again. I may be a wreck for now, but I will see my loved one again one day. I miss you, mom. May we meet again.",

  "I\u0027m 30 and I lost my father in a car crash back in 2005 and it still hunts me not being able to say goodbye and meet him before he went but I wasn\u0027t privileged with that opportunity. I was hardly overcoming that then suddenly fell in love with a girl and despite all the odds she also had same feelings although she was 2 years older than me and then from 2009 I was in a relationship with her and I was so happy to be able to marry her on 2019 but just before few months prior to getting married she left me and fell in love with someone else as she told me. With heavy heart had to cancel my marriage but to this day I\u0027m hunted with her memories, all the places we visited together hunts me and I keep praying if all these were just a dream and everything was alright in the real world but it seems the pain doesn\u0027t go away. After listening to this song I really feel I\u0027m wrecked mentally without her even though I\u0027m living, I\u0027m dead inside. Depression took better of me and tried to give up but that option didn\u0027t seemed fair since I\u0027ve a mother I can\u0027t go away doing something stupid but is living like a dead person worth it?? I ask myself. I felt so lucky when I got to know she had the same feelings for me back then and thought my sad days were over but I was so wrong. Life is just unfair. I\u0027m still overcoming the scars but time doesn\u0027t heal anything even though people say, time just adds up more pain each day. Hope I find peace someday.",

Thank you, Imagine Dragons, you\u0027re the best of our generation. I can\u0027t wait to see you in Milan and cry again just like in 2018, when you had a powerful speech about having the courage to show good emotions as well as bad ones and to not feel ashamed if you\u0027re going through depression or hard times.

My grades dropped, The things I used to enjoy doesn\u0027t bring me joy anymore. Time doesn\u0027t heal you from death, it makes you long for the person that became a memory...

  "Thank you for this song.  The parable of the missing teacher.  …. In a world full of thoughts, insight, and opportunity. Comes a world of misdirection, missed opportunity and lost motivation.  This story has one educator and one student. When does a student become something out of nothing?  … an aging student with a compass that has no barring. This student is in a situation of wonder and loss. Through a journey of no Synchronicity, and no rythmia. Begins to search for life’s balance and meaning. Signs begin to appear as this student begins the hard work of opening envelopes. These envelopes (metaphorical) require effort and energy. There can be a sense of flow that happens. But for this student they have no flow. No foundation, only hints of techniques left from past lives.  As this story begins; As student opens envelope after envelope. This student only becomes more and more lost in nature. This student has no choice but to call on help. Help from anyone, anything. Only looking for support and love. This student puts out vast amounts of envelopes. Using up nearly all of the energy this student has been saving. Energy is scarce for this student as much of it has been lost along the way… This through punishment, mocking and bullying from other students. Never to know why! Life has been challenging for this student. Who has seen no real-lesson to be offered. At least to this point.  As this student begins to look at life as too much to comprehend. With, uncountable nights passing by…. A message is received! Finally, finally a message from another student. Out of the blue… But this student is a teacher. One that comes from far away but the connection is bonded by “spirit”. This, says the teacher. Student thinks “Spirit”, I’ve always loved spirit and now spirit has shown compassion towards me.  So student and teacher agree on a hill to meet at a specific day and time. Student can’t wait for this day to come. “Maybe I will get someone to help me with this broken compass?” He thinks.  As time arrives student and teacher finally meet. This teacher has rumors of being very wise very compassionate very in touch with spirit. And student can see these instantly after their first hello… … Teacher begins with a prayer. With full-wisdom on display. The student thinks to himself. “Wow, life handed me so many choices and this is what it’s all been for”. “Ive survived, and this is now my turn to live and learn. The student quietly says to himself.” Time with these two, has gone by with so many envelopes being opened and answered…. Finally life is slowly giving back the energy that has been lost. And student quickly begins to feel what it is to live again.  As their meeting begins to end. Student thanks teacher for their sync. Teacher announces there will be another meeting! And I will bring you more knowledge. Some in literature, some in guidance and experience. As student begins to thank his teacher. He remembers but wait! “Teacher, I have no money or possessions to offer for your trip and time?”  Teacher says, “no need for your money. I only ask for your heart and your willingness to learn with me.” Their goodbye was cherished. As the student begins to believe in life and humanity again. Student sleeps with a light smile that night…. Days pass with no word from his teacher and wonder begins to creep in. This student knows he has the power of resilience on his side but can’t shake the feelings of, “Did I mistakingly open up again. And now will I be punished for doing so?”  Student holds strong for many days. But wonder and disappoint begin to dissolve the energy that was once beginning to replenish for the student….. This student continues to work hard on positive thoughts and intent. But after many attempts to speak with spirit. Spirit is nowhere to be found.  This student begins to become sad again at life. Wondering, as he says to himself. “How can a wise teacher such as him, leave such a unwatered tree as myself?” “What is happening here, what is the lesson?” This student begins to believe. There is no lesson. Only the cold hard fact of, life.  Student has a choice to make. Do I keep attempting to persuade spirit to show its self again. Or, do I not? This student attempts to do things that long ago made him content. But can’t find happiness in them anymore. He begins to believe teacher was just a force similar to all of the other challenges he’s faced in life. But this time, has a deep hurt. A hurt that is a little bit heavier than most.  This student never hears back from his teacher and never comes across another like him. As he lives out the rest of his days on earth.  But as time goes by. The student knows that he did nothing wrong and that it was the teacher that will forever have to hold onto the envelope he stopped unfolding. One he could of helped. This teacher knows there was something he could of done more for this student as the student had survived much longer than many before.  Teacher will have to live with the missed opportunity for the rest of his lives…. ….. You see… this wasn’t a lesson solely belonging to the student. It was a lesson for both! The teacher showed what it is to stop opening the envelope as is had a profound impact on the student.  And the student had many chances, many choices to discover the meanings behind the abandonment he has received so many times before. But because the student believes in his heart and spirit he continued to live out his journey. Never able to fully let go of his losses. This will be with him in his next lives as well.",

At The Disco singles : High Hopes, Hey Look Ma I Made It album : Pray For The Wicked •2019 - 2020 : Jonas Brothers singles : Sucker, Cool album : Happiness Begins •2021 - present : it looks like bands are flopping one by one with their underwhelming album sales. Male solo artists like Harry Styles and The Weekend dominate the industry. Female solo artists like Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo and Doja Cat, Group is definitely dominated by BTS.",

So I left home, and felt like shit for years, hating myself, hating him, hating his wife. I was 15. Dad had cancer before and beat it. Only for it to come back and take him from me. I was doing great, I was busting my ass to make a name and alife so I can prove my love to my dad, so I could be part of his life again. But in one swift year, I lost him. And the last conversation I had with him on his deathbed telling him stuff I didn\u0027t have the balls to tell him before he was dying and coughing up his own lungs. Because the truth was, I pushed the pain of losing him so far down that I never stopped to try and get my father back. December 13th, 2020, 2:37 am I received a call from my older brother, and I couldn\u0027t say anything. I was too shocked. Since then I let my depression get the better of me, lost my car, my home, my job, my faith. And I look in the mirror every day now and see his face, I look just like him, and I miss him all over again, and remember what I threw out in a depressed haze of self hate. I miss you dad.

В эти дни я становлюсь всем, что ненавижу Жаль, что тебя нет рядом, но теперь уже слишком поздно. Мой разум — это место, где я не могу убежать от твоего призрака. Иногда мне хочется, Чтобы я мог пожелать, чтобы все это исчезло, Еще один дождливый день без тебя. Иногда я жалею, что не могу увидеть тебя еще один день, Еще один дождливый день. О, я просто развалина без тебя здесь. Да, я в полном отчаянии с тех пор, как тебя не стало. Я пытался оставить все это позади Я думаю, что все это время был разбит Да, я просто развалина. Они говорят, что время излечит это, боль уйдет, Но все это напоминает мне о тебе и приходит волнами. То, как ты смеешься, когда у тебя трясутся плечи, Время, которое ты потратила, Чтобы научить меня всему, чему ты научила. Скажи мне, как я должен жить дальше? В эти дни я становлюсь всем, что ненавижу. Жаль, что тебя нет рядом, но теперь уже слишком поздно. Мой разум — это место, где я не могу убежать от твоего призрака. Иногда мне хочется, Чтобы я мог пожелать, чтобы все это исчезло, Еще один дождливый день без тебя. Иногда я жалею, что не могу увидеть тебя еще один день, Еще один дождливый день. О, я просто развалина без тебя здесь. Да, я в отчаянии с тех пор, как тебя не стало. Я пытался оставить все это позади Я думаю, что все это время был разбит. В эти дни, когда я нахожусь на краю пропасти, Я помню слова, которые ты сказала, Вспоминаю, какую жизнь ты вела. Ты бы сказала: «‎О, смирись со всем этим, не увязай в грязи, Думая о вещах, которые тебе следовало бы сделать»‎. Я увижу тебя снова, любимая Я увижу тебя снова, любимая Да, я просто развалина Я увижу тебя снова, любимая Да, я просто развалина без тебя здесь. Да, я в отчаянии с тех пор, как тебя не стало (С тех пор, как тебя не стало). Я пытался оставить все это позади Я думаю, что все это время был разбит Да, я просто развалина.

These days I\u0027m becoming everything that I hate Wishing you were around but now it\u0027s too late My mind is a place that I can\u0027t escape your ghost Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away One more rainy day without you Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day One more rainy day Oh, I\u0027m a wreck without you here Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck since you\u0027ve been gone I\u0027ve tried to put this all behind me I think I was wrecked all along Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves The way you laugh when your shoulders shook, the time you took To teach me all that you had taught Tell me, how am I supposed to move on? These days I\u0027m becoming everything that I hate Wishing you were around but now it\u0027s too late My mind is a place that I can\u0027t escape your ghost Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away One more rainy day without you Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day One more rainy day Oh, I\u0027m a wreck without you here Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck since you\u0027ve been gone I\u0027ve tried to put this all behind me I think I was wrecked all along These days when I\u0027m on the brink of the edge I remember the words that you said Remember the life you led You\u0027d say, \"Oh, suck it all up, don\u0027t get stuck in the mud Thinkin\u0027 of things that you should have done I\u0027ll see you again, my loved one\" I\u0027ll see you again, my loved one Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck I\u0027ll see you again, my loved one Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck without you here Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck since you\u0027ve been gone (Since you\u0027ve been gone) I\u0027ve tried to put this all behind me I think I was wrecked all along Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away One more rainy day without you Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day One more rainy day",

  "These lyrics are everything to me. I lost my grandmother a month ago. For the last year and a half of her life I checked on her every single night. In the final month before her death, it was hard but, the part that says .. ‘I want to see you just for one more day, just 1 rainy day’.. the most mundane moments of life, like even going to tuck her into bed.. You would just do anything for that day again. Even when you know death was what had to happen it still sucks so much. Love to all listening and grieving.",

  "I lost my younger brother 3 months ago unexpectedly. It\u0027s so hard to comprehend how someone with that kind of spirit, that kind of personality, that kind of energy would just be gone in a split of a second. You\u0027ll never know real grief until it hits you. You\u0027ll never know what \"rock bottom\" means until it hits you. The stuff that you see in movies don\u0027t even compare. I look normal on the outside but inside I am dead. The things that brought my brother and I so much joy are now the very same things that torment me everyday.  Whenever I hear this song I just bawl my eyes out, but then I also feel that I am not alone. Grief is a collective, cross cultural feeling, despite \"after life\" being  a cultural one. This song is so powerful, so raw, so real. Thank you for sharing it to the rest of the world...and... I\u0027ll see you again my loved one :-)",

  "\"Days pass by and my eyes stay dry, and I think that I\u0027m okay \u0027Til I find myself in conversation, fading away\" Hit me hard, especially when attached to what was happening in the video. I am always lonely even when surrounded by people, and \"fading away\" I disassociate so I literally fade away mentally. The other lines lost me though, until  the line \"I\u0027ll see you again, my loved one\" that was like an anvil hit my chest followed by 5 gallons of ice water. Might sound stupid to some of you, but, I recently had to give my service dog to a rescue, he was my rock, he helped me get through the day, and be sane, and not in a ball on the floor, or in bed, or non functioning in general... and all that just hit me and the rest of the song kinda clicked to that realization of who this song made me remember and how amazing the time we had was.",

She cried a lot with me as well, she used to talk with Grandma on the phone every day and it was like a part of her strength in life was gone for good.

I have toxic family and some disowned me after my son passed away.  Some people  just get dealt a crappy family. If its toxic maybe a break is whats needed, but please know that your family dosent defy who you are as a person and they don\u0027t defy where your going in life and who you will become! As painful as it feels maybe take this time away to reflect on what family is good for you. If they dont lift you up and love you unconditionally through your down moments then let them go. I hope you find some peace in this situation especially during the holidays. Surround yourself with people who want to see you grow and succeed. I have lost many I called family and gained new family. Do whats best for your soul! Much love and light to you Nathanael 💙 As my son would always Say... Stay strong and Never Give Up!",

I tried to move on and enjoy life but when I\u0027m out and about life really does freeze around me like in the video and I start to feel like I don\u0027t fit in. Family turned their back to me, friends turned their back to me. And honestly I don\u0027t know what keeps me going but here I am. I can\u0027t shake the feeling that it\u0027s too late for me also.",

Now mid twenties ive mastered it so much that people say wow you have no emotions and i laugh internally coz theres a literal storm inside which is just under control. So long story short youll be happy and much more happy than most people who dont learn how to deal with emotions and ultimately life itself.",
  "@@firebolt3976 Thank you so much for the reminder. I am an empath as well, however there are times when a beautiful song like this(and so many others by Imagine Dragons) will almost seem overwhelming until I give in and allow myself to feel those feelings.It\u0027s just surprising how much contrast there is between my step mom that I love compared to the bio mom that is and always will be a stranger to me. I guess I just cannot understand why..especially since losing one twin and almost losing my surviving twin.  Well now it\u0027s turning into something it wasn\u0027t supposed to be. My step mother will always be my real mother and I will always love and miss her",

Ive lost 3 friends in the past yr from overdose and 2 huge ones in the last 10 my dad and my aunt who loved everyone no matter who you were and where you came from or what you did. Life throws you so many great people at you only to take them away one day,if you dont go first. Its tough and unfair, celebrate that you actually were the one who had someone so great in your life.",

May sound corny but it was something I never felt with anyone else. How I miss her randomness and open to whatever because we were together. She did admit to me we should have gotten married. We never crossed that line which made it special to me. I never missed anyone more other than my parents and grandparents. She was and always be my lifetime love.",

I lost my dad 11 months and 1 week later when his heart stopped. 6 months and 3 days after I lost my dad (on my birthday) I had pit tickets to see Imagine Dragons, and got off work early to get ready, when I received the phone call that my best friend was found after committing suicide.

We hit it off instantly. Sadly she was an alcoholic. We lasted a year but with so many friends in common and a mutual best friend we couldn\u0027t not stay in contact, fight, not talk and then talk more, lol. We tried two other times to make it work but she preferred alcoholic men and the more I got my life on track the less she wanted anything more than friends and mu one stipulation that she get help for the alcoholism was a deal breaker for her.. One year ago today, on September 3rd 2020 she left us. Liver failure from an alcohol addiction she couldn\u0027t beat. My whole world collapsed. We all miss her, her laughs, inappropriate sense of humor, kindness, her desire for everyone to be happy. This song speaks to me so much. She like Imagine Dragons.

He knew that I’ll succeed before he leaves us 💔 Yazan, i love you and thank you for everything my brother. I’ll see again GOAT",

  "For the first time there is a song that accurately describes my mood right now.  \"Sometime i wish i could see you one more day\". My aunt passed away from cancer. It came to her very quickly, in just a few weeks. Pain, tears, self-blame.  I couldn\u0027t be with my aunt at the end of her life because of the covid 19. I could only see her face through the phone screen. Feel her pain. I really cried a lot when auntie tried to talk to me. I blamed myself. Covid 19 really took away a lot of my precious things. Please appreciate what you have before it becomes what you had.",

  "My girlfriend committed suicide 3 years ago. Her and I were together for almost 7 years. She never once talked to me without telling me that she loved me more than anything. Every time we had an argument, she would hug me until I calmed down. We would go on drives most weekends out to empty spaces, we would park the car and lay on the hood and stare at the stars. Often times we would have long deep conversations for hours until we fell asleep holding each others hands tightly. We both always knew, we would never cheat, never leave. It would never be worth it, and we always saw the amazing person standing in front of us. When I couldn\u0027t stand to look at my own reflection, she complimented me on how many people would rather be me, than their own selves. She told me her deepest, darkest secrets, and was never scared to tell the truth, no matter how painful it might\u0027ve been. We dated from middle school and high school, and even college. We spent years, on the bus, listening to music, looking in each others\u0027 eyes. Most days we took the bus home to my house, and spent the whole day playing card games. board games, and watching movies. We were more than lovers, we were best friends, we were family. I met her in a mental hospital after we both had attempted suicide. She has taught me so much. And even though she is not here today, I know that she wants me to stay alive, to keep pushing my limits, regardless of what others think. I wish I could\u0027ve saved her. Been there for her more. Every time I listen to this song I am reminded of her, and her everlasting kindness, and good heart, no matter what she was feeling. She was truly selfless. So I say to you, scrolling through the comments, STAY SAFE, STAY HEALTHY, AND STAY ALIVE. YOU ARE LOVED",
  "This hurts.",
  "Bro, sounds to me, like u had an angel",
  "As a person who has struggled with mental health issues for most of my life, I feel you deeply. There was nothing you could have done to shake her of her demons. Our brain betrays us, lies to us, convinces us we are not strong enough to keep fighting to stay. It convinces us that we are flawed and not capable or deserving of happiness. It convinces us that there will always be darkness. It convinces us that we are a burden to our loved ones. I am glad you are keeping up the fight, she wants this for you. Big hug. I wish you peace of mind, heart, soul.",

  "​@Rosie Red  I started to cry, reading Yours and @Meditation Relaxing Music comments.. So many of us go through this.. Been there myself. Only thing what got me through these tough years, was thinking about my mom and my best friend (soul sister) - they would be devastated if I did something to myself... I was in state, where I didn\u0027t care about myself, but I love them too much too hurt them like that. So I let myself feel what I felt and talked with myself - like in self therapy. Why are you feeling like that? Is it so bad or you made it so big thinking about it over and over again... And step by step I got to bottom of my problems. And when I got better, even my ex husband (alcoholic) called me and wanted to meet me to apologize for what he did wrong in our marriage. I was shocked. He always blamed me in every argument. We met and I forgave him. You can not  always meet those people, who hurt You before, but you can put them in a boat in Your mind, and let them swim off and say goodbye... there are so many ways we can do step by step... Please never give up. Remember that - even if You think You are alone, there are so many people struggling with their demons. Try to talk in Youtube comments with others like You. It really helps.  Write to me if You want. This world is crazy, but every one of us deserves happiness. Stay alive, be good to Yourself!",

We imagine what would happen if close to us person did that. It hurts as hell. When I said to my mother that I had these bad thoughts and love for her got me through this, she said - please, don\u0027t even think about doing it to yourself. - And she is right. Even when we feel alone in this and we don\u0027t have anyone who loves us so much (but it is not true, there is always at least one person who loves or admires us, even if we don\u0027t know that), lets remember that, there are so many people struggling with mental health.",

  "@@cosmicgentdareal7435 oh no, that\u0027s awful, man. I have been in Your grilfriends  skin. I thought about it when I was in a relationship. What is a reason if it is not too personal to ask? Bad thoughts about herself or some traumatic experience? Mine was low self asteem and husband alcoholic, so I got kind of co-dependent. Sleepless nights, when Im stressed- I dont eat, so low in vitamins, minerals etc. I didnt got any help. No one believed he is an alcoholic, because he is an narcistic and knows how to get liked and everyone drinks You know they said. I felt alone af. Just my best friend soul sister said - I dont understand, because I dont see these worse situations you told me happend, but, Im there for You. I got angry when other friend said - go to therapy, it helped me. I wasnt ready for that. I got in self therapy and asked my self many questions. As example - why you want to save him? He doesnt want that. He is grown ass man and let him do whatever he wants. Just get out of that bad relationship, even if you still love him. You cant make family with him. You deserve better. Even if you dont think now. It always gets better when you stop thinking about it and start doing, like 20min sport seasons. Regularily. Every week. I did just 2x a week. Just do things step by step. I didnt move out right away. I wasnt ready psihologicaly. I was in to low self asteem position.",

He was swearing a lot after it😂Today I work in a Home for the Elderly as a caregiver and death often comes to us. Someone says that is  salvation but  I think that until the last moment we have to respect life and fight for it regardless of the mental and physical condition of any person we must fight for life, for our, for others. It is a hard ride but worth it.",

  "Oh wow I cannot tell if such a story is true or not, but whichever it is, I cannot deny that it is a really touching one, and I choose to believe it, to believe the chimera of an everlasting message, reaching lives through time and space, and singing the beauty of a world we are blind to, a world that is ours, but that our own life hides from us. I choose to believe that whatever my come next, there will always be that voice deep in me, singing that world for my eyes are unable to see it, pushing me towards tomorrow, to keep up always a little more, to wait for that day I would be able to open those bursted eyes and see that joyful world for myself, and be able to sing it myself for the others. I choose to join the lady of this story, in a fight for happiness, but not only for myself, but for all the people I love and care about. Thank you.",

  "@@bobfred4410 This girl sounds pretty selfless to me. As much as anyone else I know. That her demons were different than yours or mine is no reason to apply judgement. Have you ever been deeply suicidal? Have you struggled for months at a time with the slow torture that is serious mental illness? No one—not even the people who “stay behind” are selfless. We are all human, full of light and dark, and doing our best with what we are given in life. It’s excruciating and hellish to feel like you would be better off dead. Excruciating and hellish. Full stop.  I wish for every person in that place people who can love them without judgement of where they are at, and resources to help them find the hope they need to stay alive. We need them. We need you too. But please, please love the crap out of everyone you meet, even the ones who seem “selfish”. We are doing our best.❤️",

A quienes tienen la capacidad de hacer como si nada pasara, no saben lo afortunados que son, pues aquellos quienes lo recuerdan todo, no pueden evitar sufrir día a día con todas y cada una de esas memorias que llevan en la mente y en el corazón!",
  "Before you ignore this remember that everyone started from somewhere. Hello Im Khari, Im a lover of it all Bossa Nova, Hiphop, Rock, and the beautiful jazz. I made a track called ⚔️\"Dueling Dragons\" 🐉. For years I wanted to be a musician but fear always made me say \"My time is too late, I missed my shot\" so at 26 I became fed up with the day to day, moved to rural japan 🎎🗻 and started putting out music. This song is all about the good vs. the bad. One minute you\u0027re focused, the next meeting you are distracted. One minute you are planning for great things, next minute you are wallowing in your sorrows. The beat is from Japan! The artwork is from Russia 🇷🇺 the instrumental is from the superb Dutch producer 🇳🇱 the lyrics are from America 🇺🇸and the temptation is from Germany🇩🇪 , so I hope that you enjoy the show! It\u0027s quite theatrical. We also created a new genre Hip-hop + City Pop #CityHiphop. (You jazzers might like Schroeder and Lucy though) \u003d)",

Ultimamente tenho me tornado tudo o que odeio Desejando que você estivesse por perto Mas agora é tarde demais Minha mente é um lugar Que não dá pra escapar do seu fantasma Às vezes eu gostaria de poder desejar que tudo isso acabasse Mais um dia chuvoso sem você Às vezes eu gostaria de poder te ver mais um dia Mais um dia chuvoso Oh, estou destruído sem você aqui Sim, estou destruído desde que você se foi Tenho tentado deixar tudo isso pra trás Acho que eu estava destruído o tempo todo Sim, estou destruído Dizem que o tempo cura, que a dor vai embora Mas tudo me lembra você e isso vem em ondas O jeito que você ri quando seus ombros tremem O tempo que você levou para me ensinar tudo que ensinou Me diga, como é que eu vou seguir em frente?

Up there with the Bunnymen\u0027s \"In Bluer Skies, Flaming Red or \"In the Margins\", Joy Division\u0027s \"In a Lonely Place\" or \"Decades\" in terms of depth and poignancy, this song is going to be more iconic than \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\"  As far as I was concerned music in the 2020\u0027s was dead, I knew Imagine Dragons were a great band but had no idea they would be the saviour of modern music! \"Wrecked\" even has the edge on Linkin Park\u0027s \"Numb\" in my opinion!

  "“She was the brightest light. A beacon of joy and strength for everyone she met. Her sudden passing has shaken me in ways that I still am unable to express,” Reynolds had said in a statement. “I was with her and my brother when she passed, and it was the first time in my life that I had witnessed death in this way. It sealed into my mind the fragility of life and finality of this all. I’ve watched my brother face something that no one should have to. But I’ve also seen his faith bring him hope in a future with her. I can only hope for the same.” Reynolds continued. “This song was my way of dealing with it all, as music has always been my refuge. No longer being a man of fervent faith, I can only hope that she hears it somewhere in a place where she is healed and no longer in pain. This song is my wish for an eternity with those that I love.”",

Maryam | 98 verses | Mary | Meccan Search | Recitation | Topics | Uthmani Script | Words | Quran Teacher ￼ 1. Kaf. Ha. Ya. \u0027Ain. Sad. 2. (This is) a recital of the Mercy of thy Lord to His servant Zakariya. 3. Behold! he cried to his Lord in secret, 4. Praying: \"O my Lord! infirm indeed are my bones, and the hair of my head doth glisten with grey: but never am I unblest, O my Lord, in my prayer to Thee! 5. \"Now I fear (what) my relatives (and colleagues) (will do) after me: but my wife is barren: so give me an heir as from Thyself,- 6. \"(One that) will (truly) represent me, and represent the posterity of Jacob; and make him, O my Lord! one with whom Thou art well-pleased!\" 7. (His prayer was answered): \"O Zakariya! We give thee good news of a son: His name shall be Yahya: on none by that name have We conferred distinction before.\" 8. He said: \"O my Lord! How shall I have a son, when my wife is barren and I have grown quite decrepit from old age?\" 9. He said: \"So (it will be) thy Lord saith, \u0027that is easy for Me: I did indeed create thee before, when thou hadst been nothing!\u0027\" 10. (Zakariya) said: \"O my Lord! give me a Sign.\" \"Thy Sign,\" was the answer, \"Shall be that thou shalt speak to no man for three nights, although thou art not dumb.\" 11. So Zakariya came out to his people from him chamber: He told them by signs to celebrate Allah\u0027s praises in the morning and in the evening. 12. (To his son came the command): \"O Yahya! take hold of the Book with might\": and We gave him Wisdom even as a youth, 13. And piety (for all creatures) as from Us, and purity: He was devout, 14. And kind to his parents, and he was not overbearing or rebellious. 15. So Peace on him the day he was born, the day that he dies, and the day that he will be raised up to life (again)! 16. Relate in the Book (the story of) Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place in the East. 17. She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent her our angel, and he appeared before her as a man in all respects. 18. She said: \"I seek refuge from thee to (Allah) Most Gracious: (come not near) if thou dost fear Allah.\" 19. He said: \"Nay, I am only a messenger from thy Lord, (to announce) to thee the gift of a holy son. 20. She said: \"How shall I have a son, seeing that no man has touched me, and I am not unchaste?\" 21. He said: \"So (it will be): Thy Lord saith, \u0027that is easy for Me: and (We wish) to appoint him as a Sign unto men and a Mercy from Us\u0027: It is a matter (so) decreed.\" 22. So she conceived him, and she retired with him to a remote place. 23. And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm-tree: She cried (in her anguish): \"Ah! would that I had died before this! would that I had been a thing forgotten and out of sight!\" 24. But (a voice) cried to her from beneath the (palm-tree): \"Grieve not! for thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thee; 25. \"And shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm-tree: It will let fall fresh ripe dates upon thee. 26. \"So eat and drink and cool (thine) eye. And if thou dost see any man, say, \u0027I have vowed a fast to (Allah) Most Gracious, and this day will I enter into not talk with any human being\u0027\" 27. At length she brought the (babe) to her people, carrying him (in her arms). They said: \"O Mary! truly an amazing thing hast thou brought! 28. \"O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a man of evil, nor thy mother a woman unchaste!\" 29. But she pointed to the babe. They said: \"How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?\" 30. He said: \"I am indeed a servant of Allah: He hath given me revelation and made me a prophet",

  "I\u0027ve lost one of my best friends, my mother, both grandparents, and my wife in my lifetime. It\u0027s funny how losing a family member or a best friend can leave you in a state of mourning. But nothing can compare to losing the one you love. It does things to you. Destroys you from within. Can even blur the lines of reality. And in some cases lead one to suicide. A lot of people have no clue how much more it hurts to lose the love of your life, than it does to lose your friends or family.",
  "My best friend and I were both ID fans, and this song made that bond get stronger in some word I can\u0027t describe. I always listen to birds, burn out and shots (one of his favorites) and since he\u0027s been gone (I said been because I truly believe one day I would see him again) some bands that him and I used to listen are my anchor to get to survive. We both struggled with mental health and, by the time that he was living he couldn\u0027t make it. A part of me is missing since he left, but I could hold on for him with the help of songs that could remind me of him. And this song in specifically made me feel closer to him once more. Thank you",

I\u0027ve been separated from my fiance for about 9 going on 10 months because he needed space to figure himself out then came down with COVID while away. So, this song really speaks to me. It\u0027s such a beautiful song that I\u0027m sure can touch the hearts of anyone that has lost a loved one. I hope everyone heals and feels better soon. It\u0027s always hard losing a loved one no matter how many times it happens but, surrounding yourself with the loved ones you have left, or even just talking to them when you need someone to talk to, can help a lot.

It draws out feelings from deep inside that you didn\u0027t even know you had. Thinking of loved ones that have passed away💔, and thinking of what it would be like if someone you love with every particle of your being, were to pass away. Makes you love them a little bit more, and appreciate what you have, and hope you don\u0027t ever have to go through this. Makes you hope that you go before they do, but most of all you hope they never suffer any kind of painful death.  I know that sounds odd, but let\u0027s be honest, it does... doesn\u0027t it?! Amazing song. Now I need to listen to the rest of this album!",

I know this was written about a specific person, but it\u0027s almost like Dan wrote it for me. I know the feelings exactly the way he describes. Know one knows or understands the constant onslaught of random pain and depression until they actually go through it. The only way I\u0027ve been able to get through this is knowing that she placed her faith in Jesus Christ and one day I\u0027ll see her again. I\u0027ll tell you though, knowing that doesn\u0027t make it hurt any less. As much as it hurts to listen to the song, I\u0027m glad I\u0027ve heard it.",

You said it best with: \" Know (no ) one knows or understands the constant onslaught of random pain and depression until they actually go through it. \" As long as we associate with others through blood, marriage, friendship  or affection we are going to experience the kind of loss you describe and are going through right now. My deep condolences on the loss of your beloved mother- mine passed in 2008 and there are still times when I would give anything to have just one more conversation with her.",
  "@@jaycorby You\u0027re absolutely right, Jay. The only reason I am going through this pain is because of the depth of the love I had for her.

  "Sorry about your loss. Thanks for sharing these deeply moving lyrics and your sister-in-law\u0027s words of wisdom. The beautiful music is exactly what it takes to deliver such a strong message.",
  "Dan, I\u0027m so sorry for you and your brother\u0027s loss!  She sounds like a true blessing, an Angel on earth, and an amazing friend.  Your heavy heart can be heard throughout the ballad and the effects of the lyrics are felt by many.  The loss of a loved one leaves a hole in your heart and soul that seems to remain empty for a lifetime, as no one is ever capable of replacing that person.  Others will come and go through our lives, some will be special.  For now, hold onto the ones you love for a few seconds longer, and just a bit tighter.  Breathe them in.  Remember their worth in your life.  Don\u0027t pack away all the memories for fear of the pain they may bring.  Celebrate the memories with a smile.  Don\u0027t let them fade quickly.",

  "Evangelism:  Hell and Heaven you carefully read verses 41 to 48 of chapter 9 of the Gospel of Mark, you noticed a repetition of the consequences for the misuse of our bodies, which includes doing wrong things, walking in the wrong ways and looking at the things they do stumble.  What consequences?  \"To go to hell, where the fire never goes out, where your worm doesn\u0027t die.\"  If the Holy Spirit inspired Mark to repeat it so many times, it is because he is talking about something very important: the horrible eternal damnation that does not annihilate man, soul and sensations.      The word “hell” does not exist in the originals and was used by translators in place of the term Gehenna and here means eternal torment.  In Matthew 25:41 Jesus speaks of “eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels”, which shows that it is not a condemnation made for human beings, but for spiritual beings.  Men thrown there because they reject the salvation that God offers freely.  This “lake of fire” is now empty and will be inaugurated when it receives the beast and the antichrist, then the devil, and finally all the lost, already with their bodies.  (Rev 19:20; 20:10, 15).  At this time the dead are, in spirit, in the condition of Hades, the state of separation between spirit and soul and body, the unbelievers in suffering and pain, and the saved enjoying joy in the presence of the Lord.      If the “fire” was “prepared for the devil and his angels”, we can be sure that it is not the same type of fire produced with wood, gas or an atomic explosion.  Satan and his angels are spirit and incorporeal beings unless they take human form to deceive.  But an angel could go through an atomic explosion without getting singed.  So it is evident that the Holy Spirit uses realities of the material world to understand spiritual realities.  Fire in the Bible is synonymous with judges and suffering.      By deviating from the popular spread, the lake of fire is not where the lost will live in the company of others.  It\u0027s absolute solitude.  Nor is it a place where Satan is the chief tormentor of the lost.  The devil is also one of the condemned inmates there, not someone with privileges.  The fire in this place is not the kind that generates light, as other passages speak to us of “outer darkness,” which may not only be moral but also literal.  In contrast to this, if you believe in Jesus as your Savior you can give “thanks to the Father, that we have become worthy to partake of the saints\u0027 origin in the realm of light…and blessed us with all spiritual blessings in the heavenly places in Christ ”(Luke 1:12; Eph 1:6).",

For everyone here don\u0027t forget we all live day by day month to month but death will happen, don\u0027t regret anything you say to someone because one day maybe you don\u0027t have a chance anymore to make thing right and talk with them...

But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves.” \u0026 “I’ll see you again, my loved one.” Anyone who lost someone they loved, remember, you shall see them again in Heaven! it’s not the last time you meet.. insha’allah..

Some of them we lose to death, and some we lose to other things. I have had plenty of difficult loss in the last several months that has been excruciating to deal with. However, there is this one that is different from all the others. This one, I lost to bewildering circumstances that would take an hour to explain. It has been 2 years, and I still can\u0027t wrap my head around it. All this time has passed, and she still dominates my thoughts all day long. I can\u0027t let go. I don\u0027t know how. Many say, \"get over it!\" But, they are not living in my world, and they don\u0027t understand the damage. At least, with death, there is some sort of finality to it. It\u0027s easier because there is closure. We can go through the stages of grief. We can blame God, or the universe, or the drunk driver, or the overdose, or the person who pulled the trigger. But, what if you can\u0027t blame those things? What if there is no closure? How do you let go??? Wow, I didn\u0027t expect this to be so long when I started writing it. Hopefully, it will be somehow therapeutic for me. Thank you to anyone who actually reads this all the way to the end.",

I\u0027ve never been a happy person but I was fine with it, didn\u0027t see it as a problem. Until lately I risked it all and traveled back home during the pandemic which may lead to more problems because I wouldn\u0027t be able to return and finish my study. Anyways, when I finally arrived home, the only thing I ever wanted, I did it mainly for my family, but you know... when you\u0027ve been gone for over 17 years family considers you to be a stranger and you\u0027re no longer treated as family.

  "*{SORRY FOR MISTAKES. I SPEAK ENGLISH BADLY SO I USED GOOGLE TRANSLATOR}* Hello everyone, I\u0027m from Russia and I want to tell you how much I was inspired by Imagine Dragons!  To begin with, I want to say that I was born in a city with a population of less than 300k people. My father left the family when I became 5 or 6. This is normal for 70% of CIS families.  So, I started my acquaintance with this group 4 years ago. It was the end of the 8th grade of my school. (In Russia, 5-9 grades are secondary school, 10-11 are high school).  I studied mediocre. Somewhere I missed school and had no idea why I was studying and who I would become in the future. But one day I came across this wonderful group that changed my life.For a month I listened to their songs, albums and so on. Then I decided to read the translations of the songs and I really liked the songs from the \"Night vision\" album \"It\u0027s time\". And very encouraging lines /It\u0027s time to begin, isn\u0027t it?/ And when I read this line in translation and listened to the song again, I understood. You need to change something in your life, set a goal and achieve it at all costs. The next year was the year before the Basic State Exam. This is an exam after which you can enter a technical school. This is one level below the institute. Secondary education. I went to preparation courses and passed the exams well. All this time I spent with my any group imagine dragons. Almost every day I was inspired by their songs and walked towards my goal. I entered the 10th grade and decided to study closely, because I need knowledge to enter a budgetary place at the institute. (You can get to the institute either after technical school or after grade 11 and pass the exam, a very difficult and terrible exam). I chose the second option.  And finally, I passed the exam. I entered the institute on a budget and have already completed my studies for a whole year, passed 2 sessions well and switched to the 2 course without debts! This was my first and important goal. Because my mother works in such a job where it would be impossible to combine the word life and paid education. It would be survival.  And when the group took a break, I understood everything perfectly, Dan wanted to be with his family, I read a lot about his biography, about the biography of the rest of the guys. I understood everything. But hell, how hard it was for me without their new songs, you can\u0027t even imagine. And now the day has come when the new album is announced. I was the happiest person on the planet.  By the way, now my goal is to become a director. Make beautiful films and do it with high quality. I hope I can do it. I\u0027m going to buy myself a camera and will try, try and try a lot this autumn! Summing up, I would like to say. I wish every person to find an object that can motivate and support you as much as imagine dragons! Never give up if you are truly burning with your dream. FROM RUSSIA WITH HUUUUUUGE LOVE!!!!!!!!",

  "Hey people of youtube i kinda need help from you guys i am having a hard time i know its hard for everyone and its not easy for anyone but i feel like im stuck in a place. I dont know what i expect from this i dont know what will happen but i need to let someone hear it. I am too young to be living in nostalgia and too young to be wishing that i die. The thing is all my life ive been loved half assed when i gave my all. Ive watched people giving up on me for quite long now. It has been one too many time. I was kept as an option for twice where i let my love consume me and eat me from inside. I even killed the little bit of my self respect by begging people to stay. Ive been abused by my ex and after that i got played by another girl after being broken and used by girls one after another. There was this person i met. And since the day one it felt right it felt good with her for the first time somebody valued me and i was myself with her 100% and honest i made so much efforts even the slightest thing she needed i was there for her. She accepted me for who i was and so did I. I never judged her for her past and accepted her for who she really was. She made me believe that this was it she was the person. She was so shocked to know that how people in my past have hurted me and how she would never do that to me. It felt so good when she said she loved me more than anything and that how she was willing to fight for me and could see her spending her life with me. It was all great between us. But then the worse started to kick in she started distancing herself from me and said she needed some space which i was fine with because i understood the need of personal space but she used to ghost me for the time being and then she came how she is confused with her feelings and wasnt sure and yet the next day she used to say she loves me this was so tiresome for me to be fighting and figuring out what i did wrong to not make her love me the day she felt confused after three months of being in this before this we were friends for more than an year and it was great. I watched her slowly give up on me and after promising a future with me and assuring me of everything right. She decided to leave me and said that she was unsure about her feelings and now she grew out of love with me. In just few weeks of her going back home and the last words of her in person were that how i was the best thing ever happened to her. And after giving up on me and leaving me stranded for months not even bothered where i was how i was she came back to the city and asked me to sort things out but only as a friend and that she values our friendship and dont want anything other than that. But then she told me how in those couple of months she developed feelings for this other guy from her class and shes willing to try and work out everything with him which she wasnt sure with me and couldnt see with me even though her words herself said that she did saw a future with me. Now she has apologised for everything for what she has done and that she cant undo all that but she wants to keep our friendship as it was. I too want to have her in my life as she was the best thing ever happened to me but im tired of pretending to be okay with all this when im not. I am hurt and in pain i cry myself to sleep every night i wanted this to work and did everything right for this to happen only to be given up on once again. How am i supposed to be okay with seeing her fall in love with someone else when it should have been me because she promised. Its affecting me i have trouble sleeping in night im growing silent and distant from people my family yells at me for always being in my own room. I cant explain this to them how it takes so much energy for me to just wake up and exist im not enjoying anything im fucked up now.  I dont understand what to do she is willing to work for our friendship and constantly apologise for what has happened and even wants me to go to therapy with her.  I dont understand im tired of fighting again and again and at this point im too scared to live and too scared to die and i just wish i dont wake up one day and it will be fine because it gets so heavy at times. I dont know what to do. Imagine dragons songs have always kept me going and the reason i decided to rant it all over here.",

En estos días, me estoy convirtiendo en todo lo que odio Deseando que estuvieras cerca Pero ahora es demasiado tarde Mi mente es un lugar que No puedo escapar de tu fantasma A veces desearía poder desear que todo se fuera Un dia mas lluvioso sin ti A veces desearía poder verte un día más Un dia mas lluvioso Oh, soy un desastre sin ti aquí Sí, soy un desastre desde que te fuiste He tratado de dejar todo esto atrás Creo que estuve destrozado todo el tiempo Si, soy un desastre Dicen que el tiempo lo curará, el dolor se irá Pero todo, me recuerda a ti y viene en oleadas La forma en que te ríes cuando tus hombros se agitan El tiempo que te tomaste para enseñarme todo lo que habías enseñado Dime, ¿cómo se supone que voy a seguir adelante? En estos días, me estoy convirtiendo en todo lo que odio Deseando que estuvieras cerca Pero ahora es demasiado tarde Mi mente es un lugar que No puedo escapar de tu fantasma A veces desearía poder desear que todo se fuera Un dia mas lluvioso sin ti A veces desearía poder verte un día más Un dia mas lluvioso Oh, soy un desastre sin ti aquí Sí, soy un desastre desde que te fuiste He tratado de dejar todo esto atrás Creo que estuve destrozado todo el tiempo Estos días cuando estoy al borde del borde Recuerdo las palabras que dijiste Recuerda la vida que llevaste Dirías: Oh, chúpalo todo No te quedes atascado en el barro Pensando en cosas que deberías haber hecho Te veré de nuevo mi amada Te veré de nuevo mi amada Si, soy un desastre Te veré de nuevo mi amada Sí, soy un desastre sin ti aquí (Soy un desastre sin ti aquí, amado) Sí, soy un desastre desde que te fuiste (Soy un desastre desde que te fuiste) He tratado de dejar todo esto atrás Creo que estuve destrozado todo el tiempo (Soy un desastre) Si, soy un desastre Algunas veces deseo Que podría desear que todo se fuera (Pero no puedo) Un dia mas lluvioso sin ti A veces desearía poder verte Un día más (pero no puedo) Un dia mas lluvioso",

  "Synchronicity.  Carl Jung.",
  "@@bezimienny1337 You\u0027ve made me scroll through these comments because I saw the words you left this child that\u0027s suffering.. I know when people are cruel, usually they need love the most.. so I saw you\u0027re 16 and 5 years ago you experienced one of the most traumatic events and loss at around 11 years old \u0026 I\u0027m Soo sorry for your loss. It probably feels like yesterday for you \u0026 you\u0027ve been left to make sense of this on your own and that\u0027s wrong, although not intentional, everyone processes things differently and I couldn\u0027t imagine anyone experiencing this tragedy not being affected by it, with a clear mind to provide someone else\u0027s needs \u0026 wants, especially a child\u0027s but even more than that, you\u0027re his son, the one that found him and all hell probably broke loose from that moment on..  It\u0027s so hard to imagine things being different than what you imagine when you only have your opinion to go by, which are built by the experiences which give them.. First, know, your dad didn\u0027t mean to hurt you by his actions. There\u0027s so many conditions that cause underlying depression, suicidal thoughts and it can be so overwhelming \u0026 to try to make sense of it when it\u0027s unknown, we can only assume and that\u0027s dangerous.. people assume they\u0027re too much for others, assume the world would be better off without them, assume nobody would listen or care.. I think you get the idea of what I\u0027m saying. But really, they just want the pain to stop and such heavy thoughts weigh down the positive ideas that normally rise and they can\u0027t think outside the box.. I\u0027ve learned that many, if not all people who attempt suicide \u0026 live, say they regretted it once they realized what they\u0027d done and many pray for forgiveness, a second chance \u0026 come back to live to teach us this. Try to forgive your dad and others who hurt you because they were in pain like I will \u0026 hopefully these people affected by your comments, will forgive you because you\u0027re in pain.. Also, you are giving your opinion and not stating facts when you speak for others. Please don\u0027t believe or tell everyone else there\u0027s no higher power when you don\u0027t understand it yet.. it\u0027s hard to understand how any good can come from something so bad but there\u0027s so many dimensions of our existence we cannot see just yet but instead of turning your anger onto other people or yourself, (which I\u0027m proud of you for not turning inwards \u0026 acknowledging you need help,) Consider treating others the way you needed when you needed them the most. You\u0027d be surprised how much you can heal just by being that higher power..  The past cannot be changed but only the present and future.  Its easy to be unkind to others, especially when that\u0027s all that\u0027s given.. But it takes strength and alot of experience to master being kind when it isn\u0027t expected or deserved.. but it\u0027ll give you that higher power you and the rest of the world needs \u0026 you can rise, have greater meaning for life, given more opportunities, change the world and spend your time helping others, you\u0027ll look back on this 10 years from now \u0026 see things differently, with a new set of eyes.. some middle-aged and older people never have or take the opportunity to learn this and live their whole lives with no purpose. Just grown up bully\u0027s, gossip, complain, mean to others \u0026 \"kick the dog syndrome\" ripples down the line of each family creating more conflict and pain \u0026 tragedy like you unfortunately experienced \u0026 I\u0027m so sorry.. ♥️",
  "@@bezimienny1337 Man this guy shared his experience about losing someone you love and you don\u0027t need to ruin him.Also when others believe to God you don\u0027t need to say  \u0027God doen\u0027t exist\u0027 because you don\u0027t believe to him.All these makes you mannerless and a guy who wants to impose his opinion on someone",

I want to write this message here, without believe that you would see this, but with hope!  Me and my wife have a lot of memories with your songs. I believe that your music comes from heart, and you should know that it can change people’s life’s.  Now we have very hard period, and it all going to end, but i believe that it can not ens like that, its very long to explain and i don’t want to put it all here, but it just can not end like that, because love can go through everything! And i want to ask you something: IF you would see this, and if you, as i am, believe that music comes from heart, put some message to my only love, message  that everything can change to better, we just need to try, and that i love her very much! Don’t matter where, but it would be one more argument that with love and hope even some guy as me can talk straight to you, and that, maybe, you would change someone’s life into better way!

  "Дни проходят, а мои глаза остаются сухими, И я думаю, что со мной все в порядке, Пока не обнаружу, что разговор затихает. То, как ты улыбаешься, как ты идешь, Сколько времени ты потратила, Чтобы научить меня всему, чему ты научила, Скажи мне, как я должен жить дальше? В эти дни я становлюсь всем, что ненавижу Жаль, что тебя нет рядом, но теперь уже слишком поздно. Мой разум — это место, где я не могу убежать от твоего призрака. Иногда мне хочется, Чтобы я мог пожелать, чтобы все это исчезло, Еще один дождливый день без тебя. Иногда я жалею, что не могу увидеть тебя еще один день, Еще один дождливый день. О, я просто развалина без тебя здесь. Да, я в полном отчаянии с тех пор, как тебя не стало. Я пытался оставить все это позади Я думаю, что все это время был разбит Да, я просто развалина. Они говорят, что время излечит это, боль уйдет, Но все это напоминает мне о тебе и приходит волнами. То, как ты смеешься, когда у тебя трясутся плечи, Время, которое ты потратила, Чтобы научить меня всему, чему ты научила. Скажи мне, как я должен жить дальше? В эти дни я становлюсь всем, что ненавижу. Жаль, что тебя нет рядом, но теперь уже слишком поздно. Мой разум — это место, где я не могу убежать от твоего призрака. Иногда мне хочется, Чтобы я мог пожелать, чтобы все это исчезло, Еще один дождливый день без тебя. Иногда я жалею, что не могу увидеть тебя еще один день, Еще один дождливый день. О, я просто развалина без тебя здесь. Да, я в отчаянии с тех пор, как тебя не стало. Я пытался оставить все это позади Я думаю, что все это время был разбит. В эти дни, когда я нахожусь на краю пропасти, Я помню слова, которые ты сказала, Вспоминаю, какую жизнь ты вела. Ты бы сказала: «‎О, смирись со всем этим, не увязай в грязи, Думая о вещах, которые тебе следовало бы сделать»‎. Я увижу тебя снова, любимая Я увижу тебя снова, любимая Да, я просто развалина Я увижу тебя снова, любимая Да, я просто развалина без тебя здесь. Да, я в отчаянии с тех пор, как тебя не стало (С тех пор, как тебя не стало). Я пытался оставить все это позади Я думаю, что все это время был разбит Да, я просто развалина. Иногда мне хочется, Чтобы я мог пожелать, чтобы все это исчезло, Еще один дождливый день без тебя. Иногда я жалею, что не могу увидеть тебя еще один день, Еще один дождливый день.

I know its a small thing and also I\u0027m assuming you are not from here by the way you replied. Don\u0027t know if I\u0027m wrong lol 😛 But the point is that its really really uncommon seeing someone showing any kind of interest in us saddly 😐  Usually people from most parts of the world (meaning more developed countries) don\u0027t give a sh* about anything related to Brazil and likewise other amazing places with the richest culture and the nicest people you\u0027ve could imagine spread in all our dear Latin America.  Me deixa feliz você ter investido 1 segundo do seu tempo procurando por curiosidade o significado de um comentário em português brasileiro. Eu sei que é algo pequeno e também estou presumindo que você não é daqui pelo jeito que você respondeu. Não sei se estou certa ou não kkk. Mas a questão é que é realmente bem incomum ver alguém demonstrando qualquer tipo de interesse no nosso povo #triste 🙁 Geralmente as pessoas da maioria dos lugares no mundo (pontualmente de países desenvolvidos) não dão a mínima pra nada sobre o Brasil, nem pra outros diversos lugares igualmente incríveis, com as culturas mais ricas e as pessoas mais legais que você poderia imaginar, espalhados em toda nossa querida América Latina ✌️✌️✌️ VLWW BRZADAA 💛 💚 💙",

  "this song made me think and I realised that life has no meaning for me anymore. the story is I\u0027ve been studying abroad for 17 years. I\u0027ve never been a happy person but I was fine with it, didn\u0027t see it as a problem. Until lately I risked it all and traveled back home during the pandemic which may lead to more problems because I wouldn\u0027t be able to return and finish my study. Anyways, when I finally arrived home, I did it mainly for my family, but you know... when you\u0027ve been gone for over 17 years family considers you to be a stranger and you\u0027re no longer treated as family. And that \"wrecked\" me",

  "@@mizu3711 Don\u0027t allow you do what? Call someone? Or love? Or not put off until tomorrow? You didn’t specify, so it’s not very clear. If cultures don\u0027t allow it, but you want to do it, maybe it\u0027s worth doing it ?? Or is it prosecuted? What could be behind this? In every culture, country there are and were rebels who do not agree with this and they did and do it in their own way. And about the fact that it is your fault, that you were born here, well, of course, that it is not your fault! You know what they say: \"We don\u0027t choose our parents and our homeland\"..",
  "@@kassemister9107 Yeah, it\u0027s very sad.. 17 years as if \"torn out\" of life with family and as if already as \"strangers\" to each other. Didn’t experience different situations together, didn’t discuss, don\u0027t know each other\u0027s interests, hobbies, nothing, as if there are no points of contact. It happens that other people, not relatives, who are nearby, know more about you than the family, because they are near, close in spirit. Just, you don\u0027t communicate at all in 17 years?? Your family didn\u0027t want you to leave and you left and they kind of got offended?? No? But in any case, if you\u0027re back and they show you that no matter how \"happy\" you\u0027re back, that\u0027s also kind of wrong.",
  "@@Radmila798 yeah you\u0027re absolutely right. And about your last question... they know I didn\u0027t have a choice but to study abroad and no, they didn\u0027t get offended. I just remember when I was a kid, we were much closer and they were alot more caring but now I just feel like a stranger around them and they kinda treat me that way. I don\u0027t want them to treat me good or like a king I just want to feel like I am home when being around them, but home doesn\u0027t feel like home anymore. That\u0027s where you got it right, 17 years with minimum contact is enough time to make you a stranger.",
  "@@kassemister9107 Yeah, really.. It\u0027s a psychologically difficult situation when you don\u0027t feel comfortable, calm, homely at home as in childhood.. After all, the house of childhood is such a place of tranquility, joy, protection, love, care, serenity. How I would be pleased that your situation changed for the better, so that the ice melted. Just please don\u0027t say that life no longer has meaning! It has some more, for example, it makes sense how to correct this situation.. Can you talk to your family? Say all that you feel?

I\u0027ve never been a happy person but I was fine with it, didn\u0027t see it as a problem. Until lately I risked it all and traveled back home during the pandemic which may lead to more problems because I wouldn\u0027t be able to return and finish my study. Anyways, when I finally arrived home, the only thing I ever wanted, I did it mainly for my family, but you know... when you\u0027ve been gone for over 17 years family considers you to be a stranger and you\u0027re no longer treated as family.

  "For folks who don\u0027t have a mind that constantly churns, doesn\u0027t stop even when you do everything you can to make it stop, but it won\u0027t.....this is an example of what is like with anxiety that literally sits on you. Everyone who has lost someone has that happen for a brief time, and with the passage of time things are easier to accept and you move on. However, for some people, everyday situations can trigger a memory or a thought that will not stop. It is constantly churning till something else takes over. For me, it is depression and anxiety that works like a pendulum with OCD tendencies, and it does not stop. Something embarassing from high school that happened 26 year ago pops up out of nowhere and controls you. No set time limit on it either. Only when another trigger pops up does that thought stop, but it still lingers and will pop up again. Finally sought help and I am better, but this is a perfect example of what it is like. No comparison on the level of pain in the story being told on the singer\u0027s sister-in-law, but the similarities of not being able to escape and wanting to run is the same. (I have lost friends in high school to car crashes, I have lost friends to cancer, I lost my dad to lung cancer [insert mad amounts of anger on this one], but the thought of losing my wife presents insurmountable pain, and I send all my healing vibes towards this stranger). Please take care of yourself.",

  "\u003e This is not a rock band. Well they are a pop leaning pop-rock band \u003e A little sad to see what once seemed to be heirs of rock now make EDM Are you confusing electropop with EDM? Because they have only 2 EDM songs in their 120+ song discography, both of which are not even their full songs, just collabs. They have done electropop since their debut. Since their early independent days, Imagine Dragons have always stayed and switched mostly between rock leaning pop rock and pop leaning pop rock. People like you who are not as familiar with their whole discography often make false assumptions that they got progressively poppier.  They started out as an almost country-pop band, then switched to rock in their 2009 EP, then switched to more synth driven poppy rock for the next two EPs and Night Visions, then got more rock again with their second album Smoke+Mirrors, then got more pop again with their next two albums Evolve and Origins, and this next album they are rumoured to go more rock again. Maneskin are decent. But they are not trailbrazers of rock music either. They are rehashing the same old rock sounds, instead of progressing and helping evolution of the rock genre.",

One day in near future you will go to bed and realize that this day was the first one where you felt a tiny bit better again. And the next day will be the same. And the next one. There will be setbacks as well, but overall you will recover. And I agree that there are people like no others. But there are more than one on this planet. You will find a second one and once you found her/him, you will realize that it’s even better now than with the first person, because every single day of these bad past times, brought you exactly to where you are then. Where you belong and where you were meant to be. Keep your head up, allow yourself to be happy and stay positive in your head! It’s gonna be fine.",

  "this is crazy when u analyze the viewerships. The numbers are staggeringly low compared to current hit makers like taylor swift and bts. They can easily generate 50M views in 24hrs. Even billie eilish is showing rapid decline in her recent youtube vieweships. With just 1.7M views after 24hrs, every top billing artists like imagine dragon must re-think their music video strategy. Bottom line, if your mv cant generate 20M views in 24hrs, high chance yr album wont be financially successful. Altho live gigs and concerts can make up for earnings, the prolonged global covid19 pandemic not gonna help. Either find a new manager or find a better manager.",

  "My grandpa passed away from Covid two months ago last week and today is his birthday. It took him three days between being diagnosed, going to the hospital and passing away. I thought about all of the times the idea of losing him haunted me and I never ever imagine he would be go this way. He was the most loving person I\u0027ve ever met, and the most important person in my life. He was there for me every step of the way and he accepted me when I came out like it was nothing. I haven\u0027t seen him for four years prior his passing because I had moved to LA from Brazil to try to pursue my dreams, and though he understood, he once said he was afraid he would never see me again. Til this day, it\u0027s one of my biggest regrets. I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t make it back in time, grandpa. I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t conquer my dreams on time. I still choke on my words when I try to sing or write about him, nothing I ever write seems to be accurate to my feelings. This song was it. It described everything I\u0027ve been feeling since he passed. When this song came out, I tried not to listen to it because I knew it was about Alisha and it was about grief. Dan, his family and the boys have gone through so much these past years that I knew this album would hit harder than \"Origins\". Thank you Imagine Dragons for being everything that you are. Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck since you\u0027ve been gone. Happy birthday, grandpa. I miss you.",

Behold, I am an apostle of God unto you, to confirm the truth of whatever there still remains of the Torah, and to give the glad tiding of an apostle who shall come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.\" But when he came unto them with all evidence of the truth, they said: \"This is spellbinding eloquence!\" (6) surah As-Saff those who shall follow the Apostle, the unlettered Prophet whom they shall find described in the Torah that is with them, and in the Gospel: who will enjoin upon them the doing of what is right and forbid them the doing of what is wrong, and make lawful to them the good things of life and forbid them the bad things, and lift from them their burdens and the shackles that were upon them . Those, therefore, who shall believe in him, and honour him, and succour him, and follow the light that has been bestowed from on high through him-it is they that shall attain to a happy state.\" (157) surah Al-A\u0027raf Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"He who bears witness that there is no true god except Allah, alone having no partner with Him, that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger, that \u0027Isa (Jesus) is His slave and Messenger and he (Jesus) is His Word which He communicated to Maryam (Mary) and His spirit which He sent to her, that Jannah is true and Hell is true; Allah will make him enter Jannah accepting whatever deeds he accomplished\". jesus (PBUH) said in BIBLE: Seek ye the Truth and the Truth shall free You ,do you know what\u0027s the truth is follow \"Quran\" This is what Jesus meant, peace be upon him.

  "Nice song Dan. I’ve heard you wrote this for your sister who passed away. I’m sorry for your loss. Well I’m been doing some thinking. Lately there are songs with a “warning”. The “personal” songs written by artists. The message is clear, “no this song isn’t about you, it’s about my life story, a letter for my daughter, for my sister who died, etc.” The first impression is, they protect me for confusing. The truth is nobody protect me for confusing, after all it’s a big part of a wicked game. So the protection goes to the artist themselves “don’t you dare thinking this song is about you. It’s about ME”. The fact is I’m long way passed the personal issue. With other words I don’t give a fuck about personal songs from artists. I will use and abuse any song in the way you all use and abuse me. What comes around goes around.",

  "Sometimes people No matter how strong or how fuffiled in life can never come back from a death if a loved one or best friend. Its hard to live in a world when you have lost that one person grounding you to life and sometimes in the end they cant handle it. The pain is too much. When you bottle up that pain instead of letting the world know things can get worse. This song is like a tribute for those people who cant ever let their emotions show in fear if looking weak. Pain strikes hard and hopefully so can letting someone in. I hear so many songs like this and in the end i cry because i know pain of losing someone you care about i feel alone. I feel anguish but there are people who help me. People i depend on for me to come back. This song is one that makes me sad but makes me remember im not alone and never will be. Thank you for making such a powerful speech through this song.",

  "This hits home too close moving on has been the hardest part when my sister misty who had muscular dystrophy she was 39. Is it weird I look for signs that maybe she is still here, probably not but I like to pretend so. Each and every single one of u will go down this shitty road. She was supposed to die around 4-5 years old she beat all the odds  she lived by  one thing never give up on your dreams and never stop believing in yourself.  she did more in a wheel chair then a person with walking legs! She was the strongest person I knew she passed March 25 2017.  she passed and  I felt alone and I lost myself thinking what if she pressed the emergency button, but I don’t think she did but it weighs me down. Misty O\u0027neal was a great person, a wonderful human being and we were supposed to watch the walk dead but Saturday was cut to short. I know deep down she was tired and I know that she was ready because she told me. I  did not think it would be a week after she got out of the hospital but I know that she wanted to pass at home,  she did I still cant get that day out of my head nor her eyes, they were already starting to glaze over. love you little humming bird hope u and mom are together #MDA#IMAGINE DRAGONS #GONEBUTNOTFORGOTTEN",

He had just turned 39, and his heart simply stopped beating. No illness, no medical conditions, no drugs, no reason.  My heart hasn\u0027t beat properly since that day. I lost my dad 11 months and 1 week later when his heart stopped. 6 months and 3 days after I lost my dad (on my birthday) I had pit tickets to see Imagine Dragons, and got off work early to get ready, when I received the phone call that my best friend was found after committing suicide. I still can\u0027t bring myself to go to one of their shows. Maybe next year.",

But while we (my high school friends and I) hugged and cried with all her family, we sat just a little shy of Dan and his celebrity, unsure of how to share grief with him. When I see him standing in the rain in this video, all the people with umbrellas abandoning him, I wonder if there was something more I could have done.",

Her sudden passing has shaken me in ways that I still am unable to express,” Reynolds had said in a statement. “I was with her and my brother when she passed, and it was the first time in my life that I had witnessed death in this way. It sealed into my mind the fragility of life and finality of this all. I’ve watched my brother face something that no one should have to. But I’ve also seen his faith bring him hope in a future with her. I can only hope for the same.” I lost my mother to cancer. Held her hand as she passed away. This song pulls on my heart strings.

  "I lost my grandma this year due to complications from Dementia. She was in Europe and I couldn\u0027t visit her at the end. In the summer of 2020 I had plans to fly over to visit, but the pandemic tossed that trip out the window. I regret so much not being able to see her one last time, despite knowing full well that she wouldn\u0027t recognize me. It pains me knowing I won\u0027t see her again. I won\u0027t see that beautiful smile and hear that contagious laugh of hers. I won\u0027t sit down in the kitchen with tea and talk to her, and I won\u0027t see her carefully watering and caring for each flower in her garden...To say this song hit too close to home is an understatement. Time passes and it does become easier. But sometimes I will remember something and it all comes crashing in again. Imagine Dragons really captured the emotions perfectly with this song.  Thank you for this masterpiece. It let me get some of my grief out. It never truly goes away.",

  "Alright, here it goes. I\u0027m old. Which means I\u0027ve survived (so far) and a lot of people I\u0027ve known and loved, did not. I\u0027ve lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, pets teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can\u0027t imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here\u0027s my two cents. I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don\u0027t want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don\u0027t want it to \"not matter\". I don\u0027t want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can\u0027t see. As for grief, you\u0027ll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you\u0027re drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it\u0027s some physical thing. Maybe it\u0027s a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it\u0027s a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive. In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don\u0027t even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you\u0027ll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what\u0027s going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.  Somewhere down the line, and it\u0027s different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O\u0027Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you\u0027ll come out.  Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don\u0027t really want them to. But you learn that you\u0027ll survive them. And other waves will come. And you\u0027ll survive them too. If you\u0027re lucky, you\u0027ll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks. (GSnow)",

  "I forgot about this passage.. And how beautiful and truthful it is. I first saw it after my mom died and didn\u0027t believe it was possible to heal even slightly, but I have. But the scars are there, and there they\u0027ll remain.",

Ее внезапная кончина потрясла меня до такой степени, что я до сих пор не могу выразить это, — пишет Дэн. — Я был с ней и моим братом, когда она умерла, и впервые в жизни я увидел смерть так близко. Она запечатлела в моем сознании хрупкость жизни и конечность всего вокруг. Я видел, как мой брат столкнулся с тем, чего никому не пожелаешь. Но я также видел, как его вера принесла ему надежду.

These days I\u0027m becoming everything that I hate Wishing you were around but now it\u0027s too late My mind is a place that I can\u0027t escape your ghost Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away One more rainy day without you Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day One more rainy day Oh, I\u0027m a wreck without you here Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck since you\u0027ve been gone I\u0027ve tried to put this all behind me I think I was wrecked all along These days when I\u0027m on the brink of the edge I remember the words that you said Remember the life you led You\u0027d say, \"Oh, suck it all up, don\u0027t get stuck in the mud Thinkin\u0027 of things that you should have done I\u0027ll see you again, my loved one\" I\u0027ll see you again, my loved one Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck I\u0027ll see you again, my loved one Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck without you here Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck since you\u0027ve been gone (since you\u0027ve been gone) I\u0027ve tried to put this all behind me I think I was wrecked all along Yeah, I\u0027m a wreck Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away One more rainy day without you Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day One more rainy day",

I am still mourning my father\u0027s passing, and for some reason, any emotional stressor that come my way, is just amplified by the unprocessed mourning. This song is beautiful, so beautiful that I don\u0027t know if I can listen to it all the time because it reminds me too much of the valley I\u0027ve been in for the last three years. That being said, just months after my father\u0027s passing, I finally caught a break seeing Imagine Dragons life, so thank you for letting me enjoy the present for a bit.

Твоя улыбка, твоя походка,  Время, потраченное, чтобы научить меня всему тому, чему ты научила.. Скажи мне, как я должен двигаться дальше?.. В эти дни, я становлюсь всем тем, что ненавижу,  Желаю чтобы ты была рядом, Но уже слишком поздно, Мое сознание это то место, где я не могу скрыться от твоего призрака … Вообщем, перевод целой песни оказался слишком трудоемким делом для коммента на ютубе, а с той дюжины, что я просмотрел в сети – все слишком грубые и не передают смысл песни достаточно точно.  Так что если хочешь по настоящему прочувствовать смысл песни, ничего не поделаешь, прийдется выучить язык)",

Essa letra foi uma homenagem maravilhosa, repleta de amor e a saudade desesperadora é a prova que, por mais que o tempo passe, nós nunca esquecemos quem amamos de verdade. A dor foi transformada em arte. Obrigada Imagine Dragons por sempre me fazer sentir uma explosão de sentimentos com suas músicas, vocês são incríveis 💜",

Eu gostaria que todos vocês pudessem tê-la conhecido. Ela era feroz e forte. E ela era tudo. Ela é tudo. Enquanto estava sentado no quarto do hospital com meu irmão e a observava dar suas últimas respirações, senti a dor mais esmagadora que já experimentei. Isso me abalou profundamente. Não passa um dia sem que eu pense nela. Eu a vejo em cada sorriso. Cada ato de graça e humildade eu testemunho. Ela está em tudo de bom. E dessa forma, ela vive. Espero que haja algo depois desta vida. Espero vê-la novamente. Tenho tantas saudades dela. Eu te amo, Alisha. Espero que você esteja ouvindo isso em algum lugar e dançando como sempre fazia nos shows. Na primeira fila como se ninguém estivesse olhando. Mas todos nós estávamos\" -Dan Reynolds",

Ultimamente tenho me tornado tudo o que odeio Desejando que você estivesse por perto Mas agora é tarde demais Minha mente é um lugar Que não dá pra escapar do seu fantasma Às vezes eu gostaria de poder desejar que tudo isso acabasse Mais um dia chuvoso sem você Às vezes eu gostaria de poder te ver mais um dia Mais um dia chuvoso Oh, estou destruído sem você aqui Sim, estou destruído desde que você se foi Tenho tentado deixar tudo isso pra trás Acho que eu estava destruído o tempo todo Sim, estou destruído Dizem que o tempo cura, que a dor vai embora Mas tudo me lembra você e isso vem em ondas O jeito que você ri quando seus ombros tremem O tempo que você levou para me ensinar tudo que ensinou Me diga, como é que eu vou seguir em frente? Ultimamente tenho me tornado tudo o que odeio Desejando que você estivesse por perto Mas agora é tarde demais Minha mente é um lugar Que não dá pra escapar do seu fantasma Às vezes eu gostaria de poder desejar que tudo isso acabasse Mais um dia chuvoso sem você Às vezes eu gostaria de poder te ver mais um dia Mais um dia chuvoso Oh, estou destruído sem você aqui Sim, estou destruído desde que você se foi Tenho tentado deixar tudo isso pra trás Acho que eu estava destruído o tempo todo Ultimamente, quando estou à beira do precipício Eu me lembro das palavras que você disse Lembre-se da vida que você levava Você diria: Ah, supere isso Não fique preso na lama Pensando nas coisas que você deveria ter feito Eu te verei novamente, minha amada Eu te verei novamente, minha amada Sim, eu estou destruído Eu te verei novamente, minha amada Sim, estou destuído sem você aqui (Estou destruído sem você aqui, amada) Sim, estou destruído desde que você se foi (Estou destruído desde que você se foi) Tenho tentado deixar tudo isso pra trás Acho que eu estava destruído o tempo todo (Estou destruído) Sim, estou destruído Às vezes, eu gostaria De poder desejar que tudo isso acabasse (Mas eu não posso) Mais um dia chuvoso sem você Às vezes eu gostaria de poder te ver Mais um dia (mas eu não posso) Mais um dia chuvoso",

Maryam | 98 verses | Mary | Meccan Search | Recitation | Topics | Uthmani Script | Words | Quran Teacher ￼ 1. Kaf. Ha. Ya. \u0027Ain. Sad. 2. (This is) a recital of the Mercy of thy Lord to His servant Zakariya. 3. Behold! he cried to his Lord in secret, 4. Praying: \"O my Lord! infirm indeed are my bones, and the hair of my head doth glisten with grey: but never am I unblest, O my Lord, in my prayer to Thee! 5. \"Now I fear (what) my relatives (and colleagues) (will do) after me: but my wife is barren: so give me an heir as from Thyself,- 6. \"(One that) will (truly) represent me, and represent the posterity of Jacob; and make him, O my Lord! one with whom Thou art well-pleased!\" 7. (His prayer was answered): \"O Zakariya! We give thee good news of a son: His name shall be Yahya: on none by that name have We conferred distinction before.\" 8. He said: \"O my Lord! How shall I have a son, when my wife is barren and I have grown quite decrepit from old age?\" 9. He said: \"So (it will be) thy Lord saith, \u0027that is easy for Me: I did indeed create thee before, when thou hadst been nothing!\u0027\" 10. (Zakariya) said: \"O my Lord! give me a Sign.\" \"Thy Sign,\" was the answer, \"Shall be that thou shalt speak to no man for three nights, although thou art not dumb.\" 11. So Zakariya came out to his people from him chamber: He told them by signs to celebrate Allah\u0027s praises in the morning and in the evening. 12. (To his son came the command): \"O Yahya! take hold of the Book with might\": and We gave him Wisdom even as a youth, 13. And piety (for all creatures) as from Us, and purity: He was devout, 14. And kind to his parents, and he was not overbearing or rebellious. 15. So Peace on him the day he was born, the day that he dies, and the day that he will be raised up to life (again)! 16. Relate in the Book (the story of) Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place in the East. 17. She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent her our angel, and he appeared before her as a man in all respects. 18. She said: \"I seek refuge from thee to (Allah) Most Gracious: (come not near) if thou dost fear Allah.\" 19. He said: \"Nay, I am only a messenger from thy Lord, (to announce) to thee the gift of a holy son. 20. She said: \"How shall I have a son, seeing that no man has touched me, and I am not unchaste?\" 21. He said: \"So (it will be): Thy Lord saith, \u0027that is easy for Me: and (We wish) to appoint him as a Sign unto men and a Mercy from Us\u0027: It is a matter (so) decreed.\" 22. So she conceived him, and she retired with him to a remote place. 23. And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm-tree: She cried (in her anguish): \"Ah! would that I had died before this! would that I had been a thing forgotten and out of sight!\" 24. But (a voice) cried to her from beneath the (palm-tree): \"Grieve not! for thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thee; 25. \"And shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm-tree: It will let fall fresh ripe dates upon thee. 26. \"So eat and drink and cool (thine) eye. And if thou dost see any man, say, \u0027I have vowed a fast to (Allah) Most Gracious, and this day will I enter into not talk with any human being\u0027\" 27. At length she brought the (babe) to her people, carrying him (in her arms). They said: \"O Mary! truly an amazing thing hast thou brought! 28. \"O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a man of evil, nor thy mother a woman unchaste!\" 29. But she pointed to the babe. They said: \"How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?\" 30. He said: \"I am indeed a servant of Allah: He hath given me revelation and made me a prophet",

And to think my father chased away my mother when i was 5 years old after constantly beating her daily after work. He banned us from ever seeing her... He took us far a way from her and threatened both her and us with our lives from ever meeting(a typical military African polygamous father). When i grew much older i decided to look for her... She had been living in a single room all by herself ever since... Alone... I was to finish university last year and get her a better place and living but covid happened... She contracted covid and died all alone in her house with no one around her... You can imagine the pain i felt😥😢...i couldn\u0027t even travel to bury her coz i got a scholarship to study in a foreign country and there were bans restricting movements of people all around the world. She loved and wanted me to be great and accomplished. No love exists like that of a mother and child 😟....Thank you so much Imagine Dragons for this masterpiece🙌 💯...Rest In eternal peace Mum❤",
