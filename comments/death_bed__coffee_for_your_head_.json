I don\u0027t wanna fall asleep, I don\u0027t wanna pass away I been thinking of our future cause I\u0027ll never see those days I don\u0027t know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it I tried to do my best, but you know that I\u0027m not perfect I been praying for forgiveness, you been praying for my health When I leave this earth, hoping you\u0027ll find someone else Cause yeah, we still young there\u0027s so much we haven\u0027t done Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son I wish it could be me, but I won\u0027t make it off this bed I hope I go to heaven, so I see you once again My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings Happy you were mine, it sucks that it\u0027s all ending Don\u0027t stay awake for too long Don\u0027t go to bed I\u0027ll make a cup of coffee for your head It\u0027ll get you up and going out of bed And I, don\u0027t stay awake for too long Don\u0027t go to bed I\u0027ll make a cup of coffee for your head It\u0027ll get you up and going out of bed I\u0027m happy that you\u0027re here with me, I\u0027m sorry if I tear up When me and you were younger you would always make me cheer up Taking goofy videos while walking through the park You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark Cuddle in your sheets, sang me sound asleep And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03 Sundays went to church, on Mondays watched a movie Soon you\u0027ll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me Don\u0027t stay awake for too long Don\u0027t go to bed I\u0027ll make a cup of coffee for your head It\u0027ll get you up and going out of bed And I, don\u0027t stay awake for too long Don\u0027t go to bed I\u0027ll make a cup of coffee for your head It\u0027ll get you up and going out of bed Don\u0027t stay awake for too long Don\u0027t go to bed I\u0027ll make a cup of coffee for your head It\u0027ll get you up and going out of bed And I, don\u0027t stay awake for too long Don\u0027t go to bed I\u0027ll make a cup of coffee for your head It\u0027ll get you up and going out of bed And I, don\u0027t stay awake for too long Don\u0027t go to bed I\u0027ll make a cup of coffee for your head It\u0027ll get you up and going out of bed",
