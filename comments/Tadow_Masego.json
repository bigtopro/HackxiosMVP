  "First time I heard this I was on shrooms… I did an incredible amount of healing and rebirth on that  night. And in the prior months, my life had started to take on an overwhelmingly surreal tone, and in the moment of hearing this for the first time while shrooming, the vibe held the surreal tone but it wasn’t overwhelming, it was lovely, magical, beautiful; the kind of moment that you don’t want to be over… see I recently had a kundalini awakening and the energy I’d been shrooming with had arrived into my life by no mistake.. at the time, I’d percieved him to be a soulmate. However, despite this, fulfilling a deep emotikonal connection seemed impossible and in time, the events that transpired eventually created insecurities and extreme trust issues in him while i found myself shutting down completely even tho it was the last thing i wanted to do and being uncontrollably impulsive, not only in lying to him but in doing things that i knew would upset him if he found out. A large part of me wishes we would’ve let go of eachother a lot sooner than we did bc all that holding on and determination to not quit caused was us pushing eachother away and being hurtful to the other until certain damage couldn’t be undone on one end and now the love has 100% shifted to hatred… this weighs heavy on my heart because the passion that burned was one of a kind, sacred even… but this song is a sort of link between 2 energies that are no longer linked to eachother; both hold a spot in my heart, one beautiful, one turned rotten and dead.  Some days i hear this and i makes me feel good inside, love overflowing and some other days I’m crying by the end of it, drowning in regret… that’s usually when i tap into that feeling of hearing it for the first time…it’s a lovely memory but just like the relationship as a whole, it is extremely painful… 8 minutes of a beautiful compelling masterpiece…",

  "Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior. All you have done wrong is forgiven through Jesus Christ who died for your sins.  Shame and guilt do not exist except for as a tool of the adversary.  The Lord’s sacrifice is eternal. Gratitude, selflessness and love are also eternal. Acts of kindness create a ripple effect that lasts forever. Fear of lack of permanence only guides the way of the mind that doesn’t recognize its presence.  Authenticity is something you are born with that either fades or thrives.",

When I woke up i was in the hospital for a month and during this time i had to learn to read and write again due to oxygen loss in my brain and a seizure I had underwent because of the Arrest. This song was one of the first things I listened to after all of that in the fall/winter of 2017, This actually brings a tear to my eye and makes me heavy with nostalgia. Sometimes I want to go back but I\u0027m proud of how far I\u0027ve come.

We lived this sound and the sound they provide conveys a generation, decade of development, a Golden Age not yet passed or realized, yet vividly found in this sounds foundations.

The foundations of fortunes and the floundered, forever formulated in this vibrant symphony of Vibe Fantasia. We lived this sound, and love or hate, vibe or buzz kill, like the three artists did, we lived this sound live.",

About a minute in, he belts \"Oh oh I saw her an.....\", only to realize that saxophone isn\u0027t done making magic and, of course, he\u0027s off key. He chuckles. She smiles without her eyes.  They sit in the uncomfortable energy, as their ears are caressed by love. By the 5:00 min. mark, he catches it but he\u0027s late. She says she has work early in the morning. They never see each other again. He became Post Malone. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m saying when I am procrastinating. Thank you if you got this far. I hope you have a wonderful day because youre beautiful inside and out. Everything is going to be OK. You\u0027ve got this. TADOWWWW",

  "Tadow— sounds like TOWDAH, and most likely has its roots here.. “TOWDAH” In the Bible, seven Hebrew words translate as \u0027worship\u0027 in English. Today, we\u0027re examining the word TOWDAH, to thank God with raised hands. Psalm 50:23 illustrates this beautifully: \"He who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving honors Me, and to him who orders his way aright I shall show the salvation of God.\" Here, the word \"thanksgiving\" is towdah, signifying an act of faith-filled gratitude, even in the face of challenges. It’s about thanking God not just for what He has done but also for what He will do, trusting in His promises.",

  "Raw talent, completely spontaneous song, including the lyrics, recorded in one take from beginning to end  The song “Tadow” by FKJ and Masego is a result of a spontaneous collaboration between the two artists, who met at a music festival in France in 2016. They decided to jam together in a studio in Paris, and recorded the song in one take, without any prior preparation or rehearsal. The song was entirely improvised, from the lyrics to the instruments, including the saxophone, guitar, bass, and drums. The song title, “Tadow”, is a word that Masego picked up from an episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and used it as an expression of admiration for a woman’s beauty. The song was released in 2017, and became a viral hit, with over 200 million views on YouTube",

  "Please give this a read if you have a few moments.. Here is the Gospel (or, Good News): God says that we are sinners and that no amount of good works or behavioral changes on our part could ever make us holy enough to enter into Heaven. God sent His only begotten Son to be crucified on the cross to pay for our sins. Jesus paid a debt that He did not owe, because we owed a debt of sin that we could not pay. 2nd Corinthians 5:21, “For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.” Jesus paid for our sins by dying on the cross for us all. His dead body was buried in a grave. On the third day, Jesus raised up bodily from the dead. The instant you believe this, God knows it and He saves you. John 6:47, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.” The free gift (Romans 5:15) is based solely upon your trust in what Jesus did for you, and has absolutely nothing to do with what you do for Him. Ephesians 2:8-9, “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.” It is that simple my friend to be saved 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 \"15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:\"(1 co15:1-4)",

  "Jesus Christ Saves Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time. Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God. EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God: 1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord. 2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead. Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 \u0026 9 7. John 3:16 God bless you, peace be with you always.

  "Jesus Christ Saves Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time. Jesus Christ died on the cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later to pay for the sins of mankind to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God. EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God: 1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord. 2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead. Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 \u0026 9 7. John 3:16 God bless you, peace be with you always.

I’ve seen looped bands before; however, never as a duo; this is a new thing for me and refreshing. Thomas Dolby (the Godfather of Electronic Music/Loops IMHO) must be smiling over what has come since he was the early pioneer. What I find interesting about this group, it has a mixed bag of themes, a LowFi R\u0026B feel, with a splash of Jazz Fusion at times… Almost taking the Electronic movement of the 70s, the spoken word of the 80s \u0026 90s, with a Y2K of technology… Add into a blender, and in the 21st century, here we are. Modern technology with Vintage Gear, was the basis of all “Fusion.” Bravo gentlemen…",

Innocent of suffering until the curse caught up, before he could become a man. The little boy died inside of him. That makes me cry. The little boy who tried to learn, that makes me sad. The little boy who lost his dad to drugs of emotions. The little boy I see giggling in front of me know makes me cry. It hits you when you know he had a beautiful innocent smile.  I know its not going to repeat like a broken record. His little angels will give meaning to his life. Beautiful children, let them be children as long as they need..

Yours might be filled with joy and happiness, or it might be clouded with pain and misfortune. I want you to know that you\u0027re a beautiful, wonderful, talented person. Even if your life isn\u0027t going the way you want it to right now, I know that you\u0027ll be able to make it out alright. I want you to do me a favor. I know I\u0027m just a stranger, but just trust me, okay? Every time you see your reflection, be it in the mirror in the bathroom, in a window somewhere, or in a puddle on the street, I want you to look at yourself and give yourself a hug. Because even if you aren\u0027t the prettiest or the smartest or the funniest, you\u0027re something that no one else can be: you. And you are the greatest thing you can be. Smile at strangers. Be confident in yourself. Cry when you feel like crying, laugh when you feel like laughing. Treat yourself like a god/goddess because you deserve it. Hold your head up and keep your heart open. You\u0027re worth everything and then some. And always remember that no matter what, even if it doesn\u0027t seem like it, you\u0027re everything to someone",

I\u0027m sorry I have to advertise/promote myself like that but right now I\u0027m on a really low budget, so I\u0027m really sorry but I also have no other way to do it. But I promise I will make it really quick. I\u0027m a new independent music producer, mostly electronic music. Officially started my career this year, dropped six EPs so far (most of them were already made by years) and now I\u0027m working very hard to produce an album with minimum 8-9 songs. I started this year but I\u0027m also playing with music for more than 10 years already, but never had the courage to go official until now. So with all that being said, thank you for taking your time to read my text and if you are willing to try to listen to my music... I will leave the link below. I do appreciate any kind of feedback, thank you! Here is my bandcamp page with all six EPs\u003e\u003e\u003e  I also posted 2 videos on my youtube channel so you can check me out here too.   with much LOVE, Ton Q. Take care!",

(pot. słowo naśladujące fanfary, używane dla podkreślenia jakiegoś sukcesu - u nas \"tadam!\" To zdecydowanie kawałek, którego w zeszłym roku (i nie tylko) słuchałem najwięcej! Na YouTube ma ponad ćwierć miliarda odtworzeń, i całkowicie zasłużenie. FKJ (French Kiwi Juice) czyli Vincent Fenton, to francuski multiinstrumentalista. Kawałek Tadow, który zagrał razem z Masego Music (tego Pana też zobaczymy ;)) był całkowicie improwizowany, podczas całodziennej sesji tych dwóch muzyków - tuż po ich pierwszym spotkaniu. Nie ma potrzeby dodawać więcej, odpalcie kawałek, odpalcie video, i zobaczcie w jaki sposób ten genialny twór powstał! ___ Moje postanowienie noworoczne - od 1 stycznia do 31 grudnia 2021 roku codziennie wrzucam inny ważny dla mnie kawałek, wraz z opisem. Możesz mnie znaleźć na facebooku pod nazwą Alteraktywnie, lub wejść na Alteraktywnie.pl czy śledzić moją playliste na YouTube, na której jest i ten utwór! #alteraktywnie",

The Bible reads for all have sinned and come short of the Glory of God and for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. The Bible also reads, FOR WHOSOEVER SHALL CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED. And we are all whosoevers.  If you would like to receive this gift that God has for you today, please say this after me with your heart and lips out loud. Say,  Dear Lord Jesus,  come into my heart, forgive me of my sins. Wash me and cleanse me.  Set me free. Jesus thank You that You died for me.  I believe that You are risen from the dead and that You\u0027re coming back again for me. Fill me with the Holy Spirit. Give me a passion for the lost,  a hunger for the things of God and a holy boldness to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. I\u0027m saved.  I\u0027m born again.  I\u0027m forgiven and I\u0027m on my way to Heaven because I have Jesus in my heart. Amen. (please like or comment if you said the prayer)",

Searched whole lot of random stuffs \"2 guys playing music in a room\" \"2 guys playing instrumental\" \"2 guys making good music\"  No luck. I stopped trying. Then about 5 months ago, I saw this in my recommendation. I clicked soo fast. I kept it on full volume and started vibing with it. It was beautiful, it was like I found my lost love. I listen to this every single day. If and when I meet the love of my life some day, I want this song to be playing in the background. Much love to whoever is reading this.",

The good news is that God sent Jesus to die on the cross for our sins and after three days God raised Jesus from the dead. Whoever believes in Jesus will be saved and have everlasting life! If you believe this and would like to be saved. Say a prayer to Jesus. Confess that you are a sinner, ask Him to forgive your sins, and invite Him into your heart and life to be your Lord and saviour. Live for Him everyday. Read the Word (the Bible) daily and be a doer of the Word, warn others, and keep watch for His return. (Try to buy a Bible, but if you do not have one, here is a link to a free online Bible,  ) Have a blessed day everyone!",

  "COVIDNINETEEN VACINATIONS, THE 1ST STEP TOWARDS THE MARK OF THE BEAST IS HERE SOON. A great and formidable enemy seeks to enter into the very blood of My children through the altering of your DNA. Because of the curse that came about after the fall of the first man Adam, I came to make a way for you. You are renewed and made clean again by your belief and salvation in Me, your King and Messiah, sent by My Father to redeem you by My blood sacrifice on the Cross of Calvary. Only through Me, the Door, corruptible is made incorruptible, unredeemable made redeemable. I have ransomed you in order to bring creation back to its Creator. Creator YHWH was made flesh to overcome death, hell, and the grave, and to take what was tainted and impure and make it whole again. The spiritual battle that is raging now is ultimately to strip you of the Divine image of Myself that has been placed within the DNA of My creation. Ask Me for more wisdom and revelation about this and it will be given to you. The veil was torn, access granted when I shed My blood, died and rose again. We have created you in Our image, and when you walk in holiness, righteousness and purity, obeying My commandments, I am enthroned on your heart. You are then transformed in body, soul and spirit. When this transformation occurs, the very frequency of your cells then resonates with Me and raises you closer to your Creator and further away from the lower realm and lower frequencies which keep you bound. This is by design, and when indwelled, My Holy Spirit will be the gatekeeper of your heart, and your entire being, My sanctuary, and the place where I reside in you. When this occurs, My Kingdom is on earth, as it is in Heaven. It is then that I am able to provide victory over the curse for you, preserving the Divine design I have placed within your DNA. There are many layers of revelation to know what is coded there and hidden, secrets to be revealed to only those who overcome. However, if the gates are breached by sin, lack of obedience, compromise, or lukewarmness, the enemy sets up thrones (strongholds) instead of Me, because my laws, My Word have not been written on your hearts. You have a sworn enemy whose utter mission is to destroy you. He will stop at nothing, and as My Word has foretold, the time is here when the greatest of all violence and evil against My people, those made in My image, is taking place. The battle is for the soul, and the battle is about the blood. Satan’s ultimate goal from the beginning was to corrupt the seed, corrupt the blood that carries My blueprint in you, My design for those made in Our image, your DNA. There is only one way to ensure that My Throne is upon your heart and your eternal destination is sealed, or your soul will be lost forever. Your must be born again. Your heart must be sealed with My blood. You must be quick to repent often and seek holiness above all else. Love what is true and just. Be extremely careful what your eyes see and your ears hear. This is guarding your heart, guarding its gate. It is in sealing these portals to the soul, in commanding the spirit to govern or have mastery over the soul, that you overcome. You will then be prepared for My return, and be protected from the evil one. If you have not already done so, seal the portals to the enemy now! Confess your sins and repent for the midnight hour is here! Bind the access points that have given satan legal rights within your temples, within your body, mind, soul and spirit. Give satan and all his dark kingdom a certificate of divorce and be free from the bondage, and from all the oppression and possession in your bloodline immediately! Break the curse from your ancestors back to Adam. Cover it all with My blood and command the enemy out of your bloodline, sealing it as well, the gates to your heart, using the authority you have been given through Me. Exercise dominion as a gatekeeper and a son or daughter of the Most High God, taking your positions as heirs to My Kingdom. My Holy Spirit will then have permission to use you for My glory and manifest through you in this crucial hour. *(Please see the prayers on the right hand side bar and the one titled Increased Demonic Warfare Prayer covers everything He is instructing here)* This must be done this moment!! This is crucial! Precious moments remain before the implementation of the enemy’s plan to destroy the DNA of My creation, making you forever unredeemable. The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and it must be taken by force! Take My Holy Word and dispossess what has had control of your gateways and that of your family line through covenants, oaths, soul trades and agreements made by your ancestors. Do it this moment! In Me you will be made FREE! The implementation of the plans to alter your DNA and make it programmable by something other than Me, your Creator, are here. I control and govern the DNA I have placed within you, but if you allow man to administer anything within your bodies, that will recode your DNA, I will no longer be the controller. I will no longer recognize you as My creation. You will have become a mixture of something else, an altered form of man and technology, and therefore, not in My image any longer. Do you understand what I am saying? Truly the hour is here when you must prepare to make the choice to remain fully human, infused with My Spirit. The enemy wants nothing more than to deceive you through propaganda, fear and manipulation and cause you to allow either a mark or an implant (vaccine or digital tatoo) into your bodies that will forever separate you from Me. This is your reality right now! You must know what you will choose to do. When you open doors to the enemy through sin and through your choices in life outside of My ways, the demonic spirits appoint gatekeepers over your heart, your mind, and your soul. Then those spirits invite more, and when no repentance occurs, strongholds occur. The heart of an unregenerate man is wicked and deceitful above all things. But My Word is quick, powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing apart of your soul and spirit, your joints and marrow, as I discern the thoughts and intentions of your heart. Allow Me to write My laws on your heart and you will know truth at last. You will know what is now directly in front of you and the choices that are here for you and your loved ones. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, but it does NOT have to be this way. Allow My glory to penetrate your spirit so that your soul will come under submission. To not allow this, means you will remain in bondage and you will be easily deceived. If I do not dwell in you fully, and your gates have been breached, another will easily influence you and take governance. My people, I have given you the keys to the Kingdom. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven and whatever is loosed on earth will be loosed in Heaven. Bind the strongman, bind the strongholds on your life and be delivered! The technology for the mark of the beast is here. It is upon you. It will be presented at first to be taken voluntarily, then very soon after, you will not be able to buy, sell or work. Do not wait another moment. Come out of Babylon and make Me King of your heart, the Divine Gatekeeper of your soul. The evil ones have set in motion their wicked schemes, as it must be so according to My Word. Many, many judgments will occur as I allow them. This is to wake up My church. You must know where you stand in your walk with Me, because in an instant, everything will change, and there will not be another opportunity to choose, because the choice will be made for you. You are either all in, or I am turning you over to your carnal mind and nature. You have the choice My loves, choose life and eternity in Me over eternal death in darkness.The time is now.  YAHUSHUA, JESUS THE CHRIST.  45",

This is the evident proof of #ArmenianAgression towards Azerbaijan, that we raise our voice against in front of the global communities over the years.  The number of martyrs have reached 11, including 4 high-rank military officers. #ArmenianTroops ignore the legally authorized ceasefire and war rules by attacking Azerbaijan lands and putting lives of civil people in danger.  #Azerbaijan is only trying to protect its territories as always and ready to do anything in this way.

I\u0027m going to a new school, and since school was cut short, 1/4 of my class with him didnt happen. Im typically a good student so most of my teachers let me finish work early and go work in art class; my goal was to make a giant stack of passes to put into a photo album.  Around January, I attempted suicide and he visited me in both my hospital and visiting hours in the psych place.  We had a drive-by goodbye thing for school recently, and a lot of my teachers and people i didn\u0027t remember the names of all pointed me to his direction. I have been able to forget all of these painful feelings for a long time, but now that i hear it again I can\u0027t contain myself anymore. I hope whoever got this far into my comment has a good day.",

But the good news is that you do not have to go to Hell (John 3:16). Jesus Christ loves you so much that He died on the Cross for your sins and if you Repent of your sins and Accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior then you will be saved (John 3:16). Jesus is calling on all to repent and you know longer have to live in despair but in love, joy, and peace through Jesus Christ. Amen.",

  "This song was presented to me by the guy I liked back in 2018. To this day, I don\u0027t really know what happened. I guess he lost interest and started treating me poorly and I got tired of suffering and begging for attention and walked away. Sometimes he comes to mind and it hurts a bit, not because I still want him, but because of all the promises of what could\u0027ve been. When I am in a higher state of mind I get to see that it could have only been what it was. The way things happened was the only possible way. I needed that to grow. I needed to look at myself in the mirror and know that I have my back, even if he rejects me, even if the whole entire world rejects me — which I actually felt like sometimes. This song reminds me of him because he showed it to me, but it doesn\u0027t hurt when I listen to it. It\u0027s peaceful. And this is how I want to feel. I don\u0027t want to be with that guy anymore, but I want this hurt gone. I want to like someone else without ever having to compare them to him. And I\u0027ll get there. And when I do, I know it\u0027ll be like tadow. Just felt like writing.",

The voice that comes along makes you hum along, the people you pass stare in admiration or judgement and you don\u0027t care in the slightest. Your head and hair bop to the music with more energy than you thought you could muster. This is music, the only music you want to hear right now, and there ain\u0027t nothing in the city streets that could knock you off your groove. The cars pass and make that saxophone pop, the lights in the windows are blocked with people who come to their window to vibe with you. In their sight they see your movements commanding an aura of confidence, an aura of joyous celebration. When you smile, their hearts jump, when you spin, their eyes widen. You\u0027ve captivated the eyes of the many, Fkj and Masego have capture the soul of the few. Thank you for reading, get caught up in your music. It can save you from the worst of times.",

I move from my house to work at the beach, 5 hours away from my family and friends, I was just alone knowing new people trying to go forward when suddenly a meet this guy. He show me this song. We escape from the hotel (The Westin) where I was working, (because it was forbidden to go out with the guest) so, we decide to escape and chill around but everything ends in a lovely obssession between us. I just remember everything so clear, the beach in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. The warm weather and he was singing this song, so fucking good. We end the night having sex in the beach. Then he fly back to USA and we decide to call each other every single night and morning trough facetime. Yes. Every Single night trying to be closer to each other. I woke up and he was there breathing right in front of me, trough facetime (lol).... We also share our location so we can know the places where we were. We were totally into it. We promise to stay loyal. I tried my best to get to him. I safe money and I work so hard. I came back to my hometown cause the Westin Fired me because of it, and just. I tried. The USA Embassy deny my fucking visa, Even I travel the world, Even I got my money right, even I study in a privite university they say no. It ruin all my plans to go and visit him. Then I start thinking it will be impossible for us. The ansiety and the time put negative feelings in my mind and I was so afraid of losing that I decided to lie to him, because I knew it would be the only way he will stop talking to me forever. I suggested I was not faithful to our promise and he delete me from everything. Hey Dev. If you came here for any reason, just to remember or whatever and you read this, I want you to know I lied for you to stop talking to me because it was killing me. Call me back.  ​",

  "THIS is the proper way to use loop pedals. I can\u0027t tell you how boring a song can get when musicians rely on looping, but I can tell you that definitely isn\u0027t happening here. FKJ \u0026 Masego start this piece off with what felt like a jam session, but eventually turned into an artfully composed, well structured song. I was worried in the beginning that there would be no progression to this song. Using loops can make a piece easily turn monotonous, but these guys knew how to keep it moving, almost giving the song purpose. They took a few solid minutes to really establish the piece, and in my honest opinion, that was too long. The structure could have been improved if the song was established in half that time, and then advances were made from there. You do need time to set up the beat and feel of the song, but you need to be careful not to bore your listeners. HOWEVER, if this were titled a jam session, I would be in total awe. This first half of the piece felt like it had no deliberate reason to exist or no purpose. Though it was quite beautiful, it wasn\u0027t going anywhere - like a straight line that has fun accidentals, but isn\u0027t pointing to anything worthwhile.  HOWEVER (AGAIN), this piece really changed my mind around the six-minute mark. It took them a while, but we finally got somewhere substantial! The lyrics, the melody, and everything in between finally had some substance! I mean just listen to the last 20 seconds of keyboard playing - almost ethereal. The lyrics also picked up around the same time, as well. I felt like he was finally saying something meaningful. All in all, this is an incredible song performed by clearly, insanely talented people. As much as I complained about the first 6 minutes being much longer than they should have been, after hearing the end really come together, I can overlook the slow pace of the song. Definitely a thumbs up!",

  "When I was young they was callin me lame Now they all act like they know me by name Makin up stories bout how we would hang Do what you gotta to cope with the pain Plain and it\u0027s simple, the fact still remains  Stick to the script I don\u0027t switch up or play  Back when I ain\u0027t have a buck to my name  If I ain\u0027t f*** with you nothin gon  change! Still not quite sure why I\u0027m stuck in Upstate  It is what it is, we can pick a cliché That\u0027s all on God, I\u0027m on guard like touché Handle my business like no more sick days I Need a Doctor like Em needed Dre I\u0027m like to hip hop, what kid is to Play  Never gon stop comprehend when I say This is full steam ahead like I said there’s no brakes Enough with the small talk my time here is short Daydream of nights about runnin New York  Slick, I won\u0027t slip fall or trip I just walk Think for myself give a fuck what you thought Timing is everything put that on anything We had a shot, I was just 17 At it non-stop, whole life ahead of me Tying the knot, like pass me the wedding ring ... I proposed to the game but my heart had just dropped ... cuz everything changed when she said she cannot Alone and confused I had nowhere to move So I sat in my room and I wrote through the moods  Wrote for the few that had nothin to lose Put it all on the line, but they couldn\u0027t get through ... and when no help ensued they would stop their pursuit ... Look, I know the feeling cuz I was like YOU  Stuck in the loop of the lies and the truth And the why\u0027s and the who\u0027s and if I was your shoes Fuck all that shit I already had knew By that look in your eyes I could tell we were through! ... came back like karma, full circle it haunts ya ... It made me a monsta now that’s my persona No Beamer no Benz not a Nissan or Honda Could drive like I drove on this road that I’m onto Askin myself in which way I respond to Emotions expressed when upset and I’m bothered ... to answer that question I\u0027m not even stressin I\u0027ll run through this game in a couple of seconds  And Lap every track while they catchin their breath I\u0027m like how they make records it\u0027s kinda perplexin ..Since it’s so sad, I\u0027m the antidepressant My name it hold weight, you should say it while flexin I\u0027m fucking this game up without an erection ... what must I do just to get your attention? It\u0027s up for debate, hell I\u0027m takin suggestions These Bars are on lock like I\u0027m stuck in corrections I stay up too late, always chasin perfection What does it take, divine intervention?  Give me some credit, return on investment When all said and done I just wanna be legend ... it\u0027s a miracle i haven\u0027t cracked from the pressure Still up in this bitch like the second trimester Life is in session, cant flunk this semester If rap was a lesson, then I’m the professor They callin in sick, I\u0027m just tryna get better Some Say that I\u0027m nasty, I\u0027m tryna be fresher I\u0027m fallin apart tryna get it together When and wherever just tell em whoever They sent wasn\u0027t meant to endure this endeavor Not now and not ever, no climate or weather Could change that forever I brainstorm too clever I’m dropping these bodies, let homocide catch up The coroner collect ya, the morgue’ll dissect ya A for your effort, it’s over however If this was a letter, it’s only the header",

Se escuchaba música de la mochila de un adolecente y me acerqué y encendí el identificador de canciones de mi celular. Esa canción me impactó de alguna manera y me pareció curioso que un jóven escuchara ese tipo de música hoy en día. Al mes volví a escuchar esa canción pero ahora era en Tulum Mexico. La música provenía de una cochera de una casa muy precaria y sentí como si esa canción me siguiera. Hoy de regreso en Argentina busqué el video en YouTube y me pareció amazing!. Felicitaciones a FKJ y Masego. Tienen un nuevo seguidor. I heard this song in NJ at the Bergenline Av. The music was coming of a teenager\u0027s backpack.  I went up and turned on the music identifier of my cell phone. Then I knew who he was. That song struck me in some way and I found it curious that a child heard that kind of music this days. After a month I heard that song again, but now it was in Tulum Mexico. The music was coming from a garage of a very precarious house and I felt this song \"was following\" me. Today back in Argentina I searched for the video on YouTube and I was amaze once again! Congratulations to FKJ and Masego. You have a new follower.",

  "Recently came across this paragraph in one of my favorite books - \"Another place where I find soul, one of the strongest places is in the presence of other people who I meet at soul level. It happens whenever a dialogue takes place in which both people are truly present, turning in to really hearing each other and reflecting back. A sense of discovery occurs, as when musicians get together and improvise a musical dialogue, a dialogue that depends on letting go of ego and defenses. To voice something you\u0027re feeling and put observations into words with another person who is totally present is a creative act embodying soul and love\"- Jean Bolen.  Absolutely in love with this work 👌🏽",

Girl there\u0027s something you possess, can\u0027t put my finger on it, but I must confess, from the first time I saw you in that stunning dress, I made it my quest, to win your heart but not by request, I needed you to know you had only the very best, for you to put me to the test, and if I failed you could call this to rest. There was no pressure we just took it slow Now you\u0027re asking if I\u0027ll come and see your show girl I\u0027m a king I want you to be my queen, I don\u0027t need a hoe stop me at any time if this gets too much just let me know, I\u0027ll stop this flow and I\u0027ll go  Sure it might be a while before I see you but I\u0027ll just find something for you and me to do, just us two if you\u0027re having a bad day we can play it cool, sit on the sofa watch xfactor you play judge give your review  you\u0027re critique so harsh makes me laugh when you say the things you do I\u0027m starting to feel this compatibility affinity towards your personality this attraction of your eccentricity  you help me see perspective, some relativity thought of you I\u0027m passing my limits challenging my ability how are you plucking at my heart strings so skilfully never met someone so refreshing mentally, my heart supposed to be in my chest but it\u0027s playing truancy  must be in your hands, be careful girl I know you\u0027re clumsy. My heart bleeds knowing someone with a soul so beautiful felt so much hurt but no mind they musta be delusional I haven\u0027t said how I feel about you and maybe thats inexcusable  you want to know truth girl I\u0027ll rap on if you says it\u0027s suitable... Well here I never met a girl who\u0027s so irresistible, unpredictable, thought of you I\u0027m invincible  didn\u0027t think I could feel this way thought maybe it was just fictional I\u0027m telling you deep down that your heart is fixable I\u0027ll give you hugs and kisses it\u0027s all medicinal we can go to any place see views unimaginable  girl I\u0027ll be your man, your man of principle you can be my girl, but this relation won\u0027t be typical, I like to keep things original  dinner movie dinner movie I like to keep that minimal try not to go for the usual the traditional  girl don\u0027t stare at my eyes, I\u0027ll fall in love and it\u0027ll be unconditional I\u0027ll change your state of mind to achieve the unthinkable if your not feeling this though better tell me we\u0027ll keep this simple  because it\u0027s not everyday you meet someone who\u0027s heart in return is so little. Trip to the store, walk around aimlessly goal in mind and we acting patiently  holding hands, get called a couple you look at me searching for signs of trouble like I\u0027m gonna waiver like maybe you\u0027re afraid I would crumble I feel what you been through, girl don\u0027t be afraid to fall, I\u0027ll catch you I look in your eyes, I see burning fire,  I\u0027m not most guys, I don\u0027t want a liar I see you, I see truth, I know the reason why, there\u0027s a part of you that\u0027s wants to say goodbye, maybe you hope I\u0027m a love fool, if that\u0027s the case you know the saying don\u0027t go you gotta be kind to be cruel.  Make a decision to make this division, because where we could take this I got vision trust me with your heart play it smart, restart before you depart, all that happened before just disregard girl I\u0027m your man and if you want me I\u0027m here ready to start",
