  "This duet has always made me feel as if the left side at first told their problem. The right side tried to comfort in the way he knew, according to his understanding of that feeling. But according to left person, the understanding was wrong and their words are offendong and ridiculous.  So, left is in problem, right tries to comfort and he means well, but he fails to confey that properly, and it hurts left leading to that harsh reply. A misunderstanding.",

  "I used to listen to this because it was catchy. Now I\u0027m laying thinking about how I plan to kill myself. Which way would be the best. I think of a dream where I went to train tracks and saw a girl laying there. I\u0027ve been leaning towards laying on train tracks. I\u0027m thinking of the best way to lay and make sure I die. I used to like Christian Gates\u0027 part, now I hear it and think it\u0027s all bullshit. I hate it. I hate this song. I hate being so angry. Anger is my only form of therapy now. I hate it. I\u0027m just tired of crying, and I can\u0027t smile anymore. I know clench a fist when I see those who hurt me. I used to cry, break down, and hide from everyone. Now I see them and clench a fist. I see them and feel so angry. I\u0027ve avoided hate for so long, but it\u0027s becoming so hard. I just want them to treat me nice. I just want to be heard. I just want help when I cry. I just want help when I have a panic attack. I just want to be appreciated. I just want someone to read my writing and say I\u0027m talented. I want someone to say I\u0027m not ugly. I want someone to hug me. I miss being held. My mother never held me, and my father left my life at a young age. My family hated me from birth. I grew to hate love. Avoid attachment, avoid hugs, and avoid comfort. I was alone, and I told myself I was happy. Then I met someone who held me. Who would hold me when I had a panic attack. Who would kiss me even when I fucked up. I fucked up without thinking and they would still comfort me and let me apologize and try to fix things. Then they left. It\u0027s so cheesy. I probably seem retarded or something like it. I just enjoyed comfort. I enjoyed that for the first time in my life. I wasn\u0027t alone. Now, whenever I see them, I feel angry. My friends abandon me when I start to break down. I tried talking to them, they thought I was just seeking attention. I hate them. I hate everyone. I hate myself. I want to die. I\u0027ve wanted to die what feels like my whole life. Yet I still haven\u0027t killed myself. I want to. I plan to. I don\u0027t need a note. No one cares. I just need to lay and let that damn train hit me. If you read all of this. You wasted a bit of your life. Like how I wasted mine typing this. I wish you the best, though. I hope you at least enjoyed reading my life. Here\u0027s a poem I wrote.  You look to the blade.  You wish to write your message with that familiar crimson color.  You wish to paint with that familiar red.  You want to pick up the blade.  But you look and see a pen.  A pen with black ink.  You wish to use the vibrant crimson color.  The glowing, undeniable crimson.  Instead you pick up the pen.  You write with the black ink and be vibrant with words.  Your words matter far more than how the words are shown.  If your words are shown.  Some words don\u0027t need to be shown.  Some words are for you.  You\u0027ll write and write.  You\u0027ll make mistakes.  But you\u0027ll write.  Maybe you\u0027ll reread.  Maybe you\u0027ll just write.  Maybe you\u0027ll write one day.  But the next you\u0027ll go back to the blade. But you must grab the pen.  Write.  Write \u0026 write.  Write not until your heart stops, but until your smile starts.   Do you like my writing? I know you don\u0027t, don\u0027t worry. Goodnight, whoever reads this. I hope you live a nice, long life. I plan to cut my short.",
