  "Fucking bastards! Do you think shopping at thrift stores is interesting? Do you feel superior for buying secondhand stuff and not caring about brand names? Try imagining living a shitty life where you have no choice but to own secondhand or cheap things because you live in such a miserable economic situation—something only a second-world country can \"offer\" you. If you have the chance to buy Nike or Adidas clothing—go for it, enjoy it! Because this life of mediocrity—leave it to us here in LATAM to experience! You, born in the USA, have the privilege of not experiencing the mediocrity that is living in this shithole where you don’t even know if you’ll have food tomorrow... Having to give up simple pleasures like being with your family and loved ones, just because you have to leave your country to earn enough money (to help your family) that you Americans can make working in any fast food joint... This is my outburst...",
  "Desgraçados de merda! Acham interessante compras em brechó? Se sentes os máximos por comprar coisas em segunda linha e não se importarem por coisas de grife? Imagine-se experimentar uma vida de merda e que não possuem escolha, serem obrigados a possuirem coisas de segunda linha ou de pouco preço por viverem em uma situação econômica tão merda que somente um pais de segundo mundo pode de presentear? Se podem possuir uma roupa da Nike ou Adidas, aproveitem, comprem mesmo! Porque essa vida de mediocridade deixem que nós na LATAM vivenciamos! Vocês que nasceram nos EUA possuem o privilégio de não experenciarem a mediocridade que é viver nesta merda de vida... Ter que se abdicar de prazeres simples da vida, como ter a presença de seus familiares e queridos, por ter que sair de seu país para poder conquistar um poder aquisitivo (para ajudar seus famíliares) que vocês Americanos conseguem trabalhando em um fast food qualquer... Aqui deixo meu desabafo...",
