(So should everyone else who thinks there is any point in discussing who is the singer or how she/he does it. The song is more about a message and when you get that its pretty irrelevant.) Humans from nowdays simply forget how freedom was accomplished over generations through plenty actions. This song represents this kind of feeling in a way only a few can.  So be proud to have the fkin oppertunity to listen to this over and over again. Proud to be alive in a time where you dont have to put this into your heart because your life aint worth it.

I just wish to hell she’d just act \u0026 keep her mouth shut on politics. Her mouth has caused us to ignore her more recent works. When will actors \u0026 rappers learn that no one gives a rip what you think?? Goes for both sides. Only time I care what an actor has to say is when they’re Christians trying to live a Christian life in a very evil , narcissistic environment that will ruin them for their beliefs.",

And although you think it has nothing to do with you because you’re white, Asian or already “legal” remember this, today it’s the “illegal immigrants” tomorrow it may be you. With that being said I’d like to share a poem written by Martin Niemöller,  First they came for the Communists And I did not speak out Because I was not a Communist Then they came for the Socialists And I did not speak out Because I was not a Socialist Then they came for the trade unionists And I did not speak out Because I was not a trade unionist Then they came for the Jews And I did not speak out Because I was not a Jew Then they came for me And there was no one left To speak out for me",

During choas you are not justified that during War some beautiful singer sings in beautiful tone its the emotion the hunger for safety will lead the pavement. Jennifer Lawrence voice fits and depicts the true emotion the Love, Choas, Safety, uncertain deaths and most of all victim of Aristocracy. No other version can even touch the emotion.❤",

  "DOROTHY👠 AND KATNISS🔥  In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy sets out on a long, winding journey with the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, and the Lion, searching for courage, a brain, and a heart. But what she didn’t realize is that she already had all those qualities inside her. Her magical ruby slippers held the true power all along. Glinda tells her she could’ve wished herself home anytime from the start. Those shoes remind us that we control our own path—each step is a choice, and that choice holds the power to take us where we truly want to go. Now look at The Hunger Games. At the beginning, everyone had the chance to end the deadly game by standing together and using the berries to rebel. But fear, pride, and greed kept them divided, forcing Katniss and Peeta to face the battle alone. If everyone had come together, they could’ve shattered the system and stopped the destruction early on. Both stories teach us the same lesson: the power is inside us. It’s in our choices, our unity, and the courage to act. We don’t have to wait through struggle or division to find our strength—it’s been there all along, just like Dorothy’s rd ruby shoes or the red Nightlock berries that were poisonous. We have the power to walk our own path and change the story. The choice is ours.",

Appreciate the little things, they will soon vanish to never return.... Based off of your comment, I can tell you are young. Sadly music in general has gotten worse and worse, so older songs that are/ sound good tend to stick around for long. These songs tend to go with you for life.. We grew up with them, for the younger generations, its just a song. For us, it resonates with existence, with life.... way back when things were simple, full of hope, joy and laughter......",

In the book it was just something they filmed on the spot for the resistance propaganda because Katniss just started singing it, so making it sound shaky and emotional in the movie was a good idea. I might have not had as many pauses as they did here but I like how they used it as a rally cry for the soldiers and tied it in the plot more with cutaway shots of the rebels singing it. It’s a movie so I’m glad they made it theatrical and dramatic, they should.",

Unfun fact: up until ~1980, someone working full-time and only earning minimum wage, made a little less than double the *average cost of a 1 bedroom apartment in 99% of US ZIP codes.* Today that percentage is down to less than 7% of zip codes.

  "*** In the name of self defence*** you have the right to commit holocaust and genocide in our hypocritical world😊 There have been numerous bloody massacres committed by Israeli forces against Palestinians over the decades. Among the most notable are: • Qibya Massacre (1953): Israeli forces, led by Ariel Sharon, attacked the village of Qibya, destroying many homes and killing around 69 civilians, including women and children. • Kafr Qasim Massacre (1956): Occurred during the Suez Crisis when Israeli forces killed approximately 48 residents of Kafr Qasim after enforcing a curfew that the villagers had not been informed about. • Sabra and Shatila Massacre (1982): Took place in the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, with militias carrying out the massacre under Israeli supervision, killing between 800 and 3,500 Palestinians. • Hebron Mosque Massacre (1994): An Israeli settler, Baruch Goldstein, opened fire on worshippers inside the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, killing 29 Palestinians and injuring more than 100. • Jenin Camp Massacre (2002): During the Second Intifada, Israeli forces laid siege to Jenin Refugee Camp, killing dozens of Palestinians and destroying a large part of the camp. • Attacks on Gaza Strip (2008, 2012, 2014, 2021): Israel launched several wars on Gaza, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Palestinians, including many women and children, and extensive destruction of homes and infrastructure. • Tantura Massacre (1948): In May 1948, after occupying the village of Tantura near Haifa, Israeli forces killed hundreds of villagers, who were buried in mass graves. The exact death toll remains undetermined. • Lydda and Ramla Massacres (1948): Following the occupation of the cities of Lydda and Ramla, Israeli forces killed hundreds of civilians and forced thousands of Palestinians to march under harsh conditions, leading to numerous deaths. • Beit Daras Massacre (1948): Israeli forces attacked the village of Beit Daras, and as villagers retreated, they were bombarded, resulting in the deaths of many, including women and children, in an effort to control the village. • First Gaza Massacre (1956): During the Suez Crisis, Israel launched intense attacks on Gaza, resulting in the deaths of more than 275 Palestinians in various areas of the strip. • Rafah and Khan Yunis Massacres (1956): Following the Israeli occupation of Khan Yunis and Rafah, forces carried out mass killings, killing around 500 residents of Khan Yunis and 250 in Rafah, including many unarmed civilians. • Bahr el-Baqar School Massacre (1970): Although it occurred in Egypt, Israeli air forces bombed the Bahr el-Baqar elementary school, killing 30 children and injuring others. • Nazareth Massacre (1976): On Palestinian Land Day, Israeli forces killed six Palestinians from the Galilee and Negev regions during demonstrations against land confiscation, making Land Day a symbol of Palestinian resistance. • First Al-Aqsa Mosque Massacre (1990): Sparked when settlers attempted to lay a cornerstone for the \"Third Temple\" in the mosque’s courtyard, Israeli forces intervened, killing 20 Palestinians and injuring more than 150. • Askar Camp Massacre (2002): During the Second Intifada, Israel launched an attack on the Askar refugee camp near Nablus, resulting in multiple Palestinian deaths and long-term occupation of homes to suppress the uprising. • Shuja\u0027iyya Massacre (2014): This massacre took place in the Shuja\u0027iyya neighborhood of Gaza during Israel\u0027s war on the strip, where intensive shelling killed over 70 Palestinians, injured hundreds, and destroyed numerous buildings and homes. • Great March of Return Massacre (2018): During the Great March of Return protests along the Gaza border, Israeli forces fired on peaceful demonstrators, killing over 200 Palestinians and injuring thousands. These and other massacres remain part of a bitter and tragic history endured by the Palestinian people over decades, etched in Palestinian and Arab collective memory.",

  "@@Vaso_Vic prove it is one cuz it isn’t bruhv.  I’m too tired for a big argument but Hamas wants their own ppl dead so how does one run a genocide where the opposing side also wants their own ppl dead.  Israel could kill everyone in Gaza in a week if they wanted too, so why has it been 7/8 months?  Also Israel isn’t going “let’s go and kill every Palestinian we see” it’s “let’s go kill hamas but we’re ok if civilians die too as long as we get Hamas”. Good ideology? ❌ genocidal ideology ❌.  I also never stated I supported Israel, I’m personally neutral.  It may sound like I’m not with this reply, but that’s because Israel supporters are wayyy more quiet about their support and Palestine supporters are wayyyy more vocal about their support, and that usually leads to frequent false claims and such that are easily disproven by fact and logic.  Just search up the rape of Nanking, Khmer Rouge, or the us Philippine “war” (that’s a real genocide).  They all have systems to eliminate people, and put them in labor/concentration camps before killing them.  The leader of Hamas said the Palestinians dying were necessary and gave him an advantage the other day too, you can search it up.  I’m sorry for supporting an effort to replace two bad governments and to save the innocent lives affected by them, but also knowing vocabulary ig 🤷‍♂️",

She’s a phenomenal actress, and I think the rendition of the song in the movie fits the character and story perfectly.  Katniss isn’t a singer like Lucy Gray, but she’s not inspiring people with a singing concert, but her passion for human rights in the districts.  It sounds in tune to me, maybe a little raspy and rough, but that’s what the districts are.  It’s not meant to be a Rihanna concert…it’s a lakeside tune, that begins with her singing alone and builds with more and more people joining in her in song, which is an obvious metaphor to the rebels joining her in the war against the capital.  I don’t think Lawrence is desperate to be a famous vocalist in addition to already being an A-list actress.  😂  Anyway, I love the song as it is.",

  "We didn\u0027t sing it anymore, my father and I, or even speak of it. After he died, it used to come back to me a lot. Being older, I began to understand the lyrics. At the beginning, it sounds like a guy is trying to get his girlfriend to secretly meet up with him at midnight. But it\u0027s an odd place for a tryst, a hanging tree, where a man was hung for murder. The murderer\u0027s lover must have had something to do with the killing, or maybe they were just going to punish her anyway, because his corpse called out for her to flee. That\u0027s weird obviously, the talking-corpse bit, but it\u0027s not until the third verse that \"The Hanging Tree\" begins to get unnerving. You realize the singer of the song is the dead murderer. He\u0027s still in the hanging tree. And even though he told his lover to flee, he keeps asking if she\u0027s coming to meet him. The phrase Where I told you to run, so we\u0027d both be free is the most troubling because at first you think he\u0027s talking about when he told her to flee, presumably to safety. But then you wonder if he meant for her to run to him. To death. In the final stanza, it\u0027s clear that that\u0027s what he\u0027s waiting for. His lover, with her rope necklace, hanging dead next to him in the tree. I used to think the murderer was the creepiest guy imaginable. Now, with a couple of trips to the Hunger Games under my belt, I decide not to judge him without knowing more details. Maybe his lover was already sentenced to death and he was trying to make it easier. To let her know he\u0027d be waiting. Or maybe he thought the place he was leaving her was really worse than death. Didn\u0027t Iwant to kill Peeta with that syringe to save him from the Capitol? Was that really my only option? Probably not, but I couldn\u0027t think of another at the time. I guess my mother thought the whole thing was too twisted for a seven-year-old, though. Especially one who made her own rope necklaces. It wasn\u0027t like hanging was something that only happened in a story. Plenty of people were executed that way in 12. You can bet she didn\u0027t want me singing it in front of my music class. She probably wouldn\u0027t like me doing it here for Pollux even Mockingjay Chapter 9",

  "He literally took his own decisions to reach his real goal that always was to be in the capitol and be the president some day The movie did a great job to show audience that we take our own decisions , she even say to him in the woods that is in each one of us to cross the line to evil and is our decision to stay on the \"good side\" , he responds that isn\u0027t that simple... he\u0027s just trying to justify his own acts cause already knows he crossed that line.",
  "Nah, he always had that evilness, it took him coming to district 12, making conscious decisions, killing sejanus (no matter how much he regretted, well until he came back to the Capitol and became the plinths new son), was trying to kill Lucy; he had the full intention of killing her. However, until district 12, I really believe that he could have become a good man. Even before the Lucy thing, he could have changed. But by firing those shots, Coriolanus Snow made his choice for the worse.  Tbh, I liked him a lot until he tried to kill Lucy.",

  "I\u0027m a professional Folksinger, and a lot of the songs that are collected from the \"folk\" out in the country are very unpolished like this one when collected, and later polished up and rerecorded by professional singers. This is a totally realistic example of a Traditional song that someone might sing as it was passed down to them, complete with the raw emotion such songs often have. That\u0027s why I liked it so much. It was believable.",
  "how do you think James Newton\u0027s background as a composer influenced this? Any comments? Loved your comment btw.",
  "Well, you asked for  comments, so here\u0027s a lesson! First I am not personally familiar with James Newton\u0027s musical background so I can\u0027t comment on this part, but I am very familiar with songs from the Appalachians, which is the area that the story was supposed to take place in. I could hear a similarity to other songs from these mountains, so I suspect Newton did some research. There is a long tradition of unaccompanied singing that was brought over from the British Isles, particularly Scotland. The main difference is technical, as these songs are remembered orally instead of being written down or recorded, the refrain or chorus tends to remain the same instead of being changed to fit each verse. This is not something the average listener would even notice, so it was fine with me. Songs about hanging or hangmen is pretty common, there is one about \"Hangman, Hangman, slack your rope awhile\" in which the prisoner sees each family member in turn ( father, mother, so on) but no one will help him until his sweetheart shows up and saves him. That particular song is very old and versions exist that probably go back hundreds of years, and was brought over by the original settlers when they came.  There are different tunes, versions or \"variants\" as they are called, all tell pretty much the same story and can be recognized as basically the same song by Folklorists and Folksingers. So the song in the movie is on a recognized theme. Sometimes in a concert I sing different versions of the same song from different countries and times and people are often surprised to learn it\u0027s actually the same song!  Also in the story the area is very impoverished, it\u0027s unlikely that there is recorded music or even  radio available ( forget YouTube) so it\u0027s probable that people went back to the oral music tradition. Songs like this are not just for entertainment, they are also a kind of therapy to let out strong bottled up emotions, especially if your life isn\u0027t so great and you\u0027re oppressed.  The raw way Katniss sings it is completely believable and I\u0027d have been disappointed if they had done it any other way. Folk music is often viewed kind of as an extension of the self, in the Oral tradition there would have been hundreds of songs people would have known, each one capturing a particular situation or emotion. They are very therapeutic.",
  "@@melissapinol7279your answer is impressive. now i wanna learn more",
  "Thank you! I was born in 1960 and my dad was a \"Folkie\" so I\u0027ve literally been listening to and studying this stuff all my life. Some of my very first memories are of listening to folk music, my mom said I was singing Sea Shanties when I was 3 years old! When I went to college I studied Anthropology and studied a lot of Folklore, I found out even more about the Oral tradition. I would say I\u0027m an amateur Folklorist, though I was a Counselor and a professional writer for a living. I started singing Folk music in my 20\u0027s, I used to perform for various events and did one album which is on YouTube.  If you have any specific questions about Folk music, just ask!",
  "The thought that came to mind for me when I heard this was, yeah it sounds like a folk song or something you sing around a campfire, but also I was a little surprised since there\u0027s not many lyrics and it\u0027s repeating, that it wasn\u0027t sung as a round.",
  "Woah",
  "​@@melissapinol7279Isnt the refrain in this song \"Strange things did happen here\", which remains consistent? Would that be in line with Appalachian and Scottish folk songs?",
  "Yes, a constant refrain is a common feature of both Appalachian and traditional British folk songs. It helps the singer remember the song.",
  "Как красиво  вы написали. От песни мурашки по коже... Очень сильно звучит...",
  "Exactly. You can feel her emotions when she\u0027s singing it",
  "Since the first time I\u0027ve heard this,I\u0027ve felt so connected to the lyrics that I can\u0027t Ever put my feelings into my own words. So I\u0027m grateful that someone else did.",
  "Well said. The calls for justice and liberty come from the common folk and in doing so their voices are crude and unrefined because of a mix of emotions like fear, uncertainty and sadness. Despite all this, such calls represent hope and courage in the face of all that is wrong. This song symbolizes all of this.",
  "Thanks, having made my tour of duty, it was the same, we were not singers but it was not about singing right, it was about sharing, belonging and focusing on a state of mind. I later heard some of our song, polished as you said... Beautiful but something was missing, energy, spirit.  Soul even, military songs are written for marching troops. Wish you all the best, regards from France",
  "Agree rather listen to the unpolished the way she sings it just l8ke sitting around a camp fire",
  "This is really cool insight. Thank you",
  "Love folk music!!!",
  "because of the Kontra Köchel attitude?",
  "​@@melissapinol7279 So nice to meet another who loves folk music! I\u0027m from VA and bluegrass, gospel/blues is my fave since it connects you with  the past and commonality with people today. It blows me away how Scots-Irish and African music (plucking the banjo and fiddle) roots could make something so nice together. Happy that the film went this direction with the music to show District 11s appalachian culture in the dystopian future ❤",
  "It was written by Suzanne collins for the book.",
  "My family heritage is from the Smokies (so...the same, but not exactly WV Appalachians).  Same harmonies, same chord progressions.   I love how Howard had the violin played with fiddle technique here - it was BRILLIANT and brought me back to my ancestral home from centuries ago.",
  "@@gatoesponjosoo  Appalachian-style music is actually quite easy to learn as it uses the most basic chord progressions that \"regular folks\" can hear, and play on whatever instruments they had or made.   The best violinists (IMO) learn both classical style playing as well as folk-style playing, and most string players will learn these simple folk songs as the building blocks of everything they do later.   Not that this is all about strings but this would have been a song accompanied by fiddle.  Having the tune expanded tastefully I thought was brilliant - both the strings and the voices intensify and multiply without veering into contemporary or classical harmonies (which would take the \u0027Appalachian\u0027 out of it.  I cannot get enough of Howard\u0027s music.  In anything, but especially here, in this simple piece of music.",
  "@@melissapinol7279  I was just posting somewhere that my training is classical but my ancestry is heavy, heavy Appalachian/Native American and so studying the music that comes from Appalachian traditions is my fascination.   Considering the Oral tradition perspective now has me wanting to expand my knowledge!",

  "In the first book, Katniss realizes, thanks to Peeta, that her dismissal of music comes from missing her dad. She\u0027s been resisting the raw emotion and more importantly the emotional risk that music brings with it so I think it\u0027s perfect that she\u0027s not a Broadway singer prodigy. She\u0027s a woman of action, not words. That self expression muscle in her has been actively shut down by her when she was a little girl because she realized that surviving is more important than articulating (though it is in fact a huge part of survival, which she finds out later) so yeah, she\u0027s not going to win a Tony for this. Who cares. She got something much more profound out of singing. She communicated with her dad and found the inspiration and strength she so desperately needed to keep moving forward.

  "At least an interesting song!  Are you, are you comin\u0027 to the tree? Where they strung up a man, they say, who murdered three Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be If we met at midnight in the hanging tree Are you, are you comin\u0027 to the tree Where dead man called out for his love to flee? Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be If we met at midnight in the hanging tree Are you, are you comin\u0027 to the tree Where I told you to run, so we\u0027d both be free? Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be If we met at midnight in the hanging tree Are you, are you comin\u0027 to the tree Where necklace of hope, side by side with me? Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be If we met at midnight in the hanging tree Are you, are you comin\u0027 to the tree Where I told you to run, so we\u0027d both be free? Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be If we met at midnight in the hanging tree Are you, are you comin\u0027 to the tree? Where they strung up a man, they say, who murdered three Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be If we met at midnight in the hanging tree Are you, are you comin\u0027 to the tree Where the dead man called out for his love to flee? Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be If we met at midnight in the hanging tree A mournful ballad about love, courage, and death, in its simplicity it sounds like a children\u0027s song, but gradually with increasing tempo and increasing strength, the content takes on its meaning, and the call to action becomes more and more urgent. Calling for what? ... Thanks for that!❤",

  "This song has a spooky lullaby vibe. It’s comforting in a dark way. This scene in the movies was so perfect.",

  "Love her voice",
  "Turn the light out the off",
  "Ok",
  "This song means so much more after the prequel book being released. Lucy Grey taught this song to Katniss, her granddaughter. So cool!",
  "Can you explain the granddaughter part please?",
  "the prequel is absolutely epic. I can\u0027t wait to see the film. this song has so much more meaning after reading the prequel. I hope snow listened real close to his lovers song and felt something. the end of the book blew my mind.",
  "I personally don\u0027t think Lucy is the grandmother. She was forced to flee North. She could be Coin\u0027s mother, but I don\u0027t see Lucy raising someone so bent on revenge. I do think it\u0027s highly likely Lucy\u0027s little cousin Mauve Ivory, could be the grandmother. Lucy states Mauve never forgets a song, even after hearing it once. She leaves the Convey behind, so with Katniss\u0027 Dad being the one to teach them The Hanging Tree and The Meadow and his voice being so memorable to others, I think the connection is there, just not directly from Lucy herself.",

  "This song hits different with the context BOSAS provides, just knowing Snow was *there* during the events of the song.",
  "I remember rightly when this film came out it means alot to me feel like it spoke a thousand words as I remember getting the katniss everdeen cup the name day it came out the second one at subway say that it is a coinstance I have no idea but every now and again that film comes on and I think to myself  maybe it\u0027s a sign",

This song was made in the hunger games book “the Ballard of songbirds and snakes” it was about when the tribute Lucy gray who was a singer sung about how Colianus snow ditched her at the tree and she left to live at the woods, the necklace of hope(rope) was ment via hanging as sir Janus was hanged for treachery and the are you are you coming to the tree is because he went to the tree then left and became a game maker!

And it be the last comfort you dare ask for. Side by side we be, there we be. Here we swing, for all we had last we meet. A necklace  of hope made for 2.",

  "Jennifer Lawrence said that she doesn\u0027t like this song because of her lackluster singing voice. In my opinion, though, it\u0027s not meant to by a superstar pop song. It\u0027s being sung from the perspective of a young woman who\u0027s been dragged through Hell and back multiple times, trying to make sense of what\u0027s going on in the world as her name and image inspires a revolution.

  "Her voice did what needed to be done with this version, convey, the sadnesss of the scene, the recalling of all the years oh people being hung in that tree, her unwillingness to sing cuz there was no happiness left on her to do so. It\u0027s folk is storytelling, the book cite her voice as lovely, but her not liking to sing and just doing it for specific reasons, just like Katniss did for Castor and Prim before. Rachel is a singer, her voice is trained for this so is her JOB to sing above than well. I like both versions but obviously for nostalgia and as a memento I prefer Jen\u0027s.",

  "I watched THG: A ballad of songbirds and snakes in theatres today and hearing this song in that was like a full circle moment. I love that Lucy Gray lived on through this song that she wrote for Snow, and she was connected to Katniss despite them never knowing each other. It makes sense Snow never liked Katniss as he saw her as another district 12 girl he knew, and hearing Katniss sing the hanging tree must’ve brought back so much of his past.",
  "YES!! man I tought the same, make totally sense now, and The history, just got much and more better, I loved",
  "Also the part where they use her as the mockingjay .. which is the bird he used to betray his friend I believe .. I think they where throwing sibliminals at snow",
  "@@williamvaughn4418 he used a jabberjay BUT he hated mockingjays as he saw them as unnatural (the Capitol\u0027s jabberjays had bred with the female mockingbirds in district 12 and thus mockingjays were born) . So to him this new mutated bird represented how the Capitol could not control everything and mockingjays themselves cant be controlled with those remotes like jabberjays can. It is great symbolism that Katniss became the mockingjay and that was the symbol of the resistance as it couldn\u0027t be controlled, and again it was something that Snow had hated since he was young.",
  "@@AyeshaM02 yeah but a mockingjay is still a jabberjay .. so it’s still means something .. that’s like saying in mixed I’m not black or Hawaiian.. but you are right and I do understand what your saying",
  "I didn\u0027t pick up on that. The Capitol Jabberjay were all male. The District 12 Mockingbirds were all female. There is something thematic going on there. The mockingbird is a songbird. Is Corialanous the Jabberbay? He was sent to District 12 and like the Jabberjay reported back on rebels. Was he mating with the District 12 Mockingbird? Did they make a Mockingjay? Like the Jabberbay the capitol was able to control Corialanous and Lucy Gray could not be controlled.  There are 64 years between the 10th and 74th Hunger Games. Katniss is 16, meaning there were 48 years between the 10th Hunger Games and her birth. Snow says they marry young in the districts, there could be 2 generations between Lucy Gray and Katniss if Lucy Gray got pregnant and spawned a Mockingjay. I know people think it\u0027s Maude Ivory that is related to Katniss but that parallel is pretty strong. Unless its being used more loosely. @@AyeshaM02",
  "@@04nbod that’s a very interesting take and I think you’re right that Snow represents the jabberyjay whilst Lucy Gray is the mocking bird, and years later Katniss is the mockingjay. Even if this isn’t interpreted literally as in Katniss being a direct descendant of them, I still love the parallels you’ve drawn. And yes many people say Maude Ivory is the relation to Katniss but I wouldn’t mind it being Lucy Gray. I love that Suzanne Collins has written The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes in a way that it enriches the existing lore. Even years later we find new layers and see how Snow’s arc is cyclical. So many moments of this new movie link to the original HG films and we  see how Snow was watching his insecurities and unresolved issues play out in the form of Katniss.",
  "@@williamvaughn4418 yes I see what you’re saying, and you’re right that they specifically had Snow use a jabberjay/ mockingjay as the method for causing Sejanus’ downfall, because it mirrors how the mockingjay (Katniss) was his own downfall. It’s like a you reap what you sow situation for Snow",
  "When Gaul shows the Jabberjays in their cage and the film ends with her ensnaring Snow to be her \u0027pupil\u0027. She talks about how she wants to reprogramme them to become more useful which reminds me of Peeta\u0027s \u0027reprogramming\u0027. She is telling him about being either the predator or prey and by the end of the film his paranoia has made him feel like prey so he decides to become the predator instead. I can see why people are drawing comparisons to Vader.@@AyeshaM02",
  "​@@AyeshaM02Yes, he hated them bc they weren\u0027t supposed to exist! They thrived in a place the Capitol sent their jabberjays to die.",
  "​​@@04nbodIts not that the District 12 mockingbirds were all female, its just that thr male jabberjays could only mate with the female mockingbirds. If only female mockingbirds existed they couldnt reproduce. They made the jabberjays male on purpose so they wouldn\u0027t be able to get knocked up. It still wound up backfiring on them. Lucy was the songbird (Mockingbird) and Snow was the Jabberjay, though they both had snake elements to them. Through them they created a mockingjay. A creature that wasnt supposed to exist but thrived in district 12.",
  "That\u0027s what I mean, obviously, Mockingbirds are actual creatures. The point being that the mockingbirds that made the mockingjays were female. What I\u0027m still trying to work out is how this symbolism which obviously seems to be there (Even in the new movie, his peacekeeper outfit is blue like the Jabberjay) manifests or connects. If he isn\u0027t literally the ancestor of Katniss, the relationship between he and Lucy Gray must have brought forth something that resulted in Katniss. There is another instance of it earlier in the film when Lucy Gray sings to the snakes and Snow says \u0027Get her out\u0027, then Tigress says \u0027get her out\u0027 and then everyone chants \u0027Get her out\u0027. Like Mockingjays. @@nicolina1026",

  "She has a nice voice",
  "I think the reason people point out her singing abilities is because the Katniss from the books is supposed to be a phenomenal singer. It\u0027s emphasized throughout the books, so when Jennifer Lawrence just sounds fine maybe it wasn\u0027t what people were expecting.  I think her version is fine. I enjoy listening to it.",
  "whether or not she sounds good is definitely not the point of this part of the movie",
  "Her voice is haunting and BEAUTIFUL! Perfect not only for this song, but for any good folk song, or probably any kind of music that requires a voice with soul!!!! I\u0027m shocked that not everyone feels this way??? Her voice is amazing, it reminds me of the great Janis Joplin, and even the beyond talented Joan Baez! (Just realized how to add, but also Amy Winehouse and Stevie nicks are both voices that come to mind! Her voice is awesome and she should honestly look into music as a second \"career/income\", lol, I only put lol b/c she\u0027s such an amazing actress I\u0027m certain she\u0027s busy enough, but the woman can sing!!!!! And I\u0027m a music snob! My favorite band is \"The Beatles\", Lennon is my hero, and I think he would love this song and her amazing voice!!!!",

  "@@shadowfax9177  What you quoted in the book doesnt contradict the movies singing. Unless there is further context describing her voice I think it still fits. Emotional resonance alone justifies that hyperbole.",
  "@@dark6.6E-34  it actually does. I don\u0027t know why it\u0027s so difficult for people to admit that Jennifer Lawrence doesn\u0027t have the best singing voice when compared to lets say Lucy Grey. It doesn\u0027t diminish her, it just is. It\u0027s just weird how people deny reality.",
  "@@shadowfax9177 You dont get what I am saying. The description of \"birds going quiet for her voice\" fits the context of her singing due to the emotional charge in that scene. It doesnt have to be perfect professional singing, just good folk styled singing portraying the atmosphere of the scene which figuratively speaking birds react to.  Unless there is more context in the book i am not aware of that paints a better picture of her voice, this alone makes sense. Either way, the scene and singing works and doesnt have to be portrayed 1 to 1 like the books in this case.",
  "@@dark6.6E-34 I get what you are saying but you clearly don\u0027t understand what I\u0027m saying. The book states that Katniss\u0027 voice was so beautiful that the birds went quiet to listen to her sing. This happened when she was a little girl and there was nothing about \u0027emotional charge\u0027 as to the reason. Just a gorgeous voice. What the original comment stated was such a far deviation from the books, I simply stated that. Then everyone decided for some reason I was \u0027hating\u0027 on Jennifer Lawrence.",
  "​@@shadowfax9177 to avoid pedantry and splitting hairs ill focus on the latter. We only see her sing in this tense moment which excuses the shaky gloomy voice. The op was obviously referring to the films scene, and since they chose not to show her young singing voice it doesnt deviate (contradict) too much from the book, Unless the book put a lot of emphasis on the singing which I wouldnt know.  I dont see you hating on anything lol, you are making valid claims, and are probably right about there being deviation. But imo it fits the way they contextualized it in the film.",
  "@@dark6.6E-34 yes that\u0027s all fine. I just added my two cents saying it deviated wildly from what the book wrote. To be honest I was looking forward to hearing what a voice sounded like that silenced birds and it was a let down for me.",

Don’t rely on your preconceptions of what you grew up listening to. Branch out a little bit. I know it can be done, from personal experience.",
  "@grantscarsdale2997  I haven\u0027t listened to mainstream music in decades so this comment is just laughable. A beautiful singing voice, one that makes the birds fall silent, is how Katniss\u0027 voice is described in the books. The text book definition of a beautiful singing voice is characterized by a warm rich tone that is smooth, resonant and pleasing to the ear. It has a range that can effortlessly navigate through different registers from deep lows to soaring highs. The vocal control is precise in pitch, dynamics and phrasing which allows the singer to convey nuances in the music such as expression of emotions of joy, or longing. It always has an artfully controlled vibrato that adds warmth and richness which enhances the beauty without overpowering the melody.  I never stated Jennifer Lawrence had a bad voice. She can stay on pitch for the most part, however she does not have any of those characteristics that I previously mentioned. To say otherwise is denying reality. I\u0027m not sure why people like you are so far stuck up these celebrities butts that any portrayal of them has to be overflowing with only positive, glowing comments. So much that when I don\u0027t tow the line you verbally attack my character.  Therefore for you to tell me \"nature abhors fakeness\" and to \"expand your horizons of what music means\" while denying the realities of what objectively qualifies someone to be labeled as having a beautiful singing voice is just poetic irony.",
  "I like it",
  "It\u0027s meant to be a folk song. Not meant to be sung perfectly, but like this",

  "So well stated.",
  "Who is the singer? Familiar to lorde",
  "The tone and cadence definitely reminds me of songs I would hear distant family in Kentucky sing. (I was raised up in Ohio. Some of the more recent ancestors were bussed up to Ohio for work).",
  "She was Prim’s okder sister, not Mom. Just a little point of correction. You are soo right. And I loved how she sang it. It’s perfect and I love how it speeds up as she continues singing.",

  "If there were new books and movies, I\u0027d imagine it like this. Katniss dies, and the world mourns her, but a new faction enters now that Katniss is gone, and her influence is gone. And they take over leaving Katniss is children to take charge, but then they die, leaving the world in mayhem. And eventually all districts are just as bad as district 13. Years past until Katniss wakes up not in the districts but in an unknown land a land of nobody a land in which nature flourishes she thinks it\u0027s a nightmare of her past hunger games, but it sure isn\u0027t it\u0027s real there are other people men and women and a big pile of weapons, supplies and others in the middle, and then she sees her sister or does she? She is hallucinating and confused, she fights and when it\u0027s the last two it\u0027s her and her dead sister. The capitol calls that the games are over, but Katniss can\u0027t hear, she\u0027s in a different mind space, and they witness her shooting at nothing. Then the world slowly crumbles and Katniss truly wakes up from a horrid dream she is awakened in the world nothing is there nothing at all! She is covered in sand and can barely breathe, she runs to many hidden places, revealing the events leading up to the great war before and the history of her world and how she can save it. A figure then appears a man not peter but the President he greets Katniss, and she freaks out crying and saying \"I thought you got killed!\", He replies\" I never did you\u0027d think you and your peasants can kill me?\", \"all you are is a poor woman\". Katniss bows him right in the heart she notices that the blood is changing his skin and reveals the man the myth the legend Peeta!  He apologises before dying in her arms, she vows to murder whoever done it and finds clues left behind by whoever made Katniss is world well her world! Eventually, she takes a boat to this small island, signing a new song. Here\u0027s a short snippet \"Peeta, would beg to see this earth heal, excel not descend, to this end. And for me, not to see, none of my friends here by me, makes me plead for mercy!\" Yes, I know it\u0027s shitty, but this isn\u0027t a hunger game movie/ book without a song Then she lands at a place when she steps foot on the sand the floor disappears and reveals it was all an illusion, and it was truly a waterfall she enters a place filled with deadly creatures ready to kill, and she gets pounced at ready to die, but then the movie ends ready for the next!",

And the \"why\"for me is(hanging tree) - i realize that,i wont feed the system,i want to love - and you know...if you dont step in the line,the system or any form of Snow try to crush you... I hope,i know the difference between good and bad...",
  "@@kareszjako5497 be very careful the path you\u0027re walking on. Snow was right about one thing, chaos knows how to be wasteful. And nothing good comes from waste. And the best proof of that is Coin. A better proof yet, is Jin from \"Ghost of Tsushinima\". His limit should have been before the poison. The poison became too much. At that point, he didn\u0027t want to just defeat the Mongols anymore, otherwise he wouldn\u0027t need it. He wanted to watch them suffer while doing it. And look where that got him. The poison was reingenered by the Mongols and he may have inspired people to become more agressive and dishonest (there\u0027s this side mission in which people pray to an assassin from the old Yariwaka rebellion to murder their enemies), which could lead to new conflicts like the one from the Yariwaka rebellion.",
  "@@JabamiLain I asked something about you. Its okay not to answer.I can deal with that. I dont like (and I think nobody does) if somebody analize me,and top of that - wrongfull,while i wrote down who i am. Can you analize your own self? What do you think,are you living in the reality? Do you know, that the system we are living in(You,i many people) is manipulated? What do you think about me? I need help? With your answer,do want to help me? I said,a want to love. This is the wrong path for me,what you are talking about? Or that - i dont trust the system and their leaders - and I dont want any part of IT.Is that? Or ... I dont will thank for them,that they buy the media for  mislead the nations for endless and never enough profits.Is that? If i say, what is happening - i make the chaos? What is agressive? - saying the reality,what is happening or the world is not enough...? Its not mandatory to answer. But please,dont teache me from games cuz I live in the line of reality.Every day. I\u0027m here(at this song) cuz,its a metaphore( for me) - the nations are dying,and the elite is entertaining. Trying to see the difference between good and bad - and act the true every day...sometimes its werry hard. Who said it was easy?",
  "@@kareszjako5497 you are good at analysing everything around you and seeing the bigger picture. I like that. I didn\u0027t understand understand your question was directed at me. Yes. There are these three songs that don\u0027t leave my head, \"How do you love someone\", \"Left outside alone\" and \"Sick and tired\" as love and hope, even though beautiful and necessary, if left unchecked, have the ability to destroy you. And yes, you talking about the fact that the system is rigged has the potential chaos, which wouldn\u0027t be bad, as chaos is also another way of saying biologic and true untainted self, if people knew how to properly use it by balancing it with order, something people foolishly deem impossible, as for them, control and order doesn\u0027t mean let your best self (and no, I\u0027m not talking about its classic definition of best self) come out, but rather repress everything about you. I don\u0027t deny the need to change the laws in the system, but we need to do it properly, in a way that we only destroy what\u0027s necessary and not the entire system, as it is needed to feed us and give us confort. I\u0027m not saying I want to be part of the system, no, I prefer to be above it, or to be in the top of it, anything that allows me not only to be loved and admired, but to shape it, in a way that balances chaos and order. I hope I made myself clear and wasn\u0027t too confusing.",
  "@@JabamiLain Now we are talking! :) Thank you for the clear and honest answer! Its a very rare thing to hear/read honest thougts. I will write a longer answer - im just a little bit \"sick and tired\" :)",
  "@@kareszjako5497 how do you know people are not honest in their writing ? What gives them away ? When you\u0027re not \"Sick and tired\" anymore, answer me. Okay ?",
  "@@JabamiLain No problem,i will answer. I\u0027m 39 years old. I tell my life experience. It will be long :) to see the whole picture. I cant answer with a few word.  I grow up in a heavy loaded family. Do you know that feeling,when you in something(family,relationship,school,the street,with friends,at work,...or the system with a higher view),and you think...this is \"normal\". Ofcourse its normal,cuz everybody doing it. And you dont have questions,none.Why would you have?Its everything in order....just i dont find my self in it. I want to be useful,reasoned - but with my death....its sick.I know. But i got this feedback from my family,and from everywhere. Why? This is my legacy from my family.I am always the last.I doesnt exist. I cant roar so loud,to my family hear me.Its sad. So before my 33 birthday,i have a plan.I want to die at 40,cuz there is nothing after 40...(sick thinking) - with a useful death...i save somebody,and i die...something like this...which i see in movies.  :)  In a sick family - i grow up sick. But where is the twist?I am now 39 and i dont want to die at 40.I dont want to die at all :) And the 180 degree is i want to be useful,reasoned with my ...life :) We find each oders with my darling,when i was 33.I dont have any relationship to this time. But im glad.I got many embarrassing,shameful situation. At this time,was my first light in my life. I see things differently.Why? Cuz i got positive feedback.And that way,i can compare. Ohhh yes,the question - how do i know?... My life experience is,the honest people is talking about his/herself.Even if he/she has mistakes - and talks about it.Not polishing the story.And responsible.Makes example,at least trys. And what i see today? Everybody is perfect.Try to make me,look like - the problem is always with me...sure. If i die,the world will be a better place...nope. \"If everybody just do his/her own part,the world will be a better place\". - Gandhi There is another question. - How do i know what is right,and what is wrong? I try to know my self.Selfknowlidge - i have a lot of fails,mistakes. What gives them away? - i learn psychology autodidact.Just very very rookie :) - but i understand roles.Roles like in a family. What i will take with me to the life(jobinterview,to the job,to the relationship, friendship,...conversations,and whatever i go - they come with me,they are my parts). There is good in bad thing - like learning from it. And i see that not just my family is sick. Its very rare to see a healthy family - like whom live in peace,honesty(they act like what they say),and love(free,supporting eachothers for nothing,just cuz i want to support,no need to explain :)) You know what...i know its a hard for living.But if i can support ...or i can make conversation with somebody who write about hisself,im happy. Ohh and one more thing - what gives them away? - if we speak to eachother :)",
  "@@kareszjako5497 my family is a bit sick too, not to the point of having lack of confidence (because my mom always worked in my confidence in a good way) or having suicidal thoughts, but to the point that I am sick and tired of being here at home. I thrive to be better than most people in moral, ethichal and psychological terms, and I know I can be, because I am constantly seeing movies, games and series with deep stories and symbolisms. Unlike you however, I want the system to remain, simply to be... improved in the way I see fit, because I never felt I was useful by just being part of it. And no, I\u0027m not overeacting. I mean, the feeling of uselessness unless I managed to change the system came recently, but litterally since I was little I\u0027ve never understood why people did things such as lying so much.",
  "@@JabamiLain I understand what you talking about.Cuz i was there.I walked on that road. My fav game was the Resident Evil - its metaphorically for my life.I wasntable to play like a half an hour per day.I played like ...too many hours for what?entertaining? - the truth is i dont have plans,i cant tell who am i... And yes,the story is what i like in a game the else is secondary.I like The Last of Us. - But i realise - why i like survivor games? - cuz in the real life i dont live the days,i survive them. From the time i was introduce to my self,i was beginning to love...my self.The whole time,i live in a world - where i thinked,i must something do to save the world - But i need to do my part,and so as everybody. And i just thinked that i was doing my part,but i wasnt.  The question :) from how do i know,what is my part,and what is not - what is good,what is bad? If i live in a community,where i can live(and not survive!!),a the community can also live with me together - there is love - and love is life. I was living at home,with my mom(Im not copying you,just to be sure) - for 33 years. And i also like films with content,True content :) Why people lie so much? - its a hard issue. I will tell my thoughts next time, if you want to...I dont want to just write,cuz \" u have to learn\"... its not mandatory - YOU ARE FREE :)",

  "*!SPOILER ALERT!* FOR The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. THIS WAS MADE BY GOLDEN HAMBURGER! I would just like to say that I have a theory. Lucy Gray Baird lived after Coriolanus shot in the woods. She may have even been Katniss\u0027s grandmother. Lucy created the song for Coriolanus Snow and was probably the only one that had knew about it. There was a chance that she could have told someone in the covey, or somewhere else, but I doubt it. She had died, how would anyone else know the song. There could be a Mockingjay that repeated it, but I doubt people would really hear it. She would have had to live in disguise too. Although, if she lived she could have passed it down to close friends. She could also pass it down to her daughter if she had one. The daughter or her close friends could pass it down too. Somebody had to tell her the song. If it was Katniss\u0027s mom, my theory might be right. If you have any ideas feel free to tell me. Remember, this is just a theory btw.",

  "@@lucygilbertson3746 I know all this, I\u0027ve been recording, mixing, coding DSP \u0026 before that building outboard gear for music/broadcast studios for longer that I can remember (and I\u0027ve also used wavestune on hundreds of recordings, mines included, and melodyne extensively).  I wanted to add \"if it\u0027s used it\u0027s very slight, not manipulated to fuck\" but forgot. But I still doubt it, since this interview is probably referring to the movie scene where she starts singing on set with no reference tone and looks way too perfectly on pitch and it does sound tweaked.  From what I gather, this is a different studio recording for the OST, where obviously the best takes were chosen, and even then she\u0027s often off pitch and it sounds way more natural than the movie version.",
  "The fact that she isnt a singer actually makes the song a lot better imo. Shes not playing a singer. Shes playing a mentally tortured girl living in a dystopian dictatorship, under constant oppression from everyone. She’s been through the horrific nightmare that is the hunger games. Her voice reflects that perfectly: unstable, rough, etc. She sounds as broken as she is.",

  "I love this song. I\u0027ve only read the books and have not seen the movies but after reading The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes I looked it up to see what tune the moviemakers came up with. I think this is perfect! This song:   (*Spoilers for the series*) 1. Was written by Lucy Gray Baird after she witnessed the hanging of Arlo Chance in District 12. He was convicted for the murders of three men and before he was executed, he called out to his lover, Lil, telling her to run. Later, Lil was caught and hung alongside Sejanus Plinth, whom Coriolanus Snow betrayed. 2. Is also about Billy Taupe telling Lucy Gray that if he is going to hang, she must hang with him. However, before he could kill her, he was shot dead by Spruce. 3. Was used by Lucy Gray to send a message to Coriolanus about the place where they were to meet the next morning to escape to the North together. 4. Was banned right after Lucy Gray sang it for the first time because of its controversial lyrics. 5. Was (presumably secretly) passed down through generations until it reached Katniss Everdeen, who heard it from her father. 6. Is used by Katniss in a propaganda video to inspire rebels during the second rebellion.",
  "This song is also used by Lucy to trick Snow into admitting his defiance that killed Sejanus Plinth (killed the third man?) Thus, ending her \"trust\" toward him and lead to that accident.",
  "Also, the \"dead man called out\" bc the fathers of the mockingjays (whatever they\u0027re called in English) repeated his last words",
  "@@alunatic4989 Yes, it was the jabberjays! That\u0027s why it sounded like the (already dead) man was talking.",
  "imagine Snow’s reaction hearing it again !!!!!",
  "I love how this song comes back to haunt Snow, just like how katniss(potatoes) and Mockingjays did. The rebels basically shoved it in his face during Peeta\u0027s \"interview\" by playing Katniss singing this song.",
  "The history and storylines in those books are SO AMAZING!!! Chilling the way you can line it up next to so many actual histories. We should\u0027ve learned by now!!",
  "A letter to all those looking for a Mockingjay: Allow me to lead our generation towards a new day of equality. The older generations have refused to give us the power given to them, so now we are taking it. If the older generations won’t step aside and make way for progress, they no longer have a seat at the table. They need to realize that we aren’t children anymore, and we will take control one way or another. They can either give us a seat at the table or we will take one by force. It’s up to them. They decided their fate the moment they decided to ignore us. If they ignore our ideas, we ignore theirs. There’s a difference between ‘respect’ and respect. Respect can mean treating someone like an authority, or it can mean treating someone like a person. When older people say ‘if you don’t respect me, I won’t respect you’, what they mean is, ‘if you don’t treat me like an authority, I won’t treat you like a person’. That’s exactly what they’ve done. They’ve stopped treating us like people because we won’t lick their boot. So now we need to stop acting like they’re an authority with any power over us. If they have no authority, they can’t stop us. They need to realize the different types of respect before it’s too late. We would love for them to have a seat at the table, but if it comes down to choosing our rights or their values, I will burn their seat at the table before giving up on my new family.  They can’t control us anymore. We don’t fear them. They don’t need to fear us, but if they continue to ignore us, they will. This won’t end easily, but it’ll be worth anything that happens. We will succeed, we will win, and we will have a voice. They can’t stop us anymore. I’ll die before I let our generation be trampled any longer. I will do everything in my power to be seen as an equal to older generations. And if that comes peacefully, great. If it doesn’t, that’s their fault. We will use violence if they refuse to step aside, but we’d rather march with them than over them.  They can’t see the flaws engraved into their psyche. Their policies are marred by prejudice and manipulation. Capitalism is inherently flawed and is bound to fail. It’s only still hanging on because people are scared of change. It will fall, we just need to push it. We need a democratic socialist society. Abolish the electoral college, give employees true democratic power in the workplace, etc. You can’t be ‘for the people‘ if the only people you’re for are the ones with power. Those aren’t ‘the people’, those are the figureheads. Not all of Britain looks like the queen. The figureheads are not an accurate reflection of any society. Figureheads are the best of the best and in no way represent the working class. And yet they are the only ones with true power over the working class’s rights.  We are not being represented, we are being repressed. We’re told that if they got their money, we can too. But they don’t acknowledge the corruption, bribery, and privilege that gave it too them. We are not all in the same boat, we’re just sailing the same sea, weathering the same storm. Some of us are on cruise ships, while others are out at sea in nothing but a life vest. We need to make sure that cruise ship becomes the titanic. This cannot be allowed to continue. We need equality. Just because we’re in the same sea does not mean we all have the same opportunities to survive at sea. We need to tear down that cruise ship to create life boats. The cruise ship has more that enough material to save everyone if we give up our indoor swimming pool and basketball courts. We need to take apart the cruise ship to save everyone’s lives. And that means relinquishing a few luxuries in the process. But if a society is demolished by giving everyone a fair chance, that society has no right to exist. It should not be enough that a few people have all the luxuries.  The minimum wage cannot buy a two bedroom apartment anywhere in the US. We are on the way towards the average person not being able to afford bread. And the French can tell us how that goes. A revolution is inevitable, we just need someone to instigate it. We need a spark. And now this group is the spark. We can burn capitalism to the ground, but only if we keep moving. We have to keep fighting, no matter the cost. If you get hurt, hurt them back. You get killed, walk it off. We have to win. There’s no other option. We cannot afford to give up. This is bigger than us. We’re fighting for the rights of an entire nation. We can’t back down now. We’ll seize the day, and we’ll seize it by the fucking throat if we have to.  We’re fighting for those who can’t fight. We’re fighting for ourselves, for our family, and for our future. We’re fighting to form a nation. And we won’t stop now. We are fighting to create a world for nobody to be scared of just existing. We’re going to fight to the last breath if we have to, but that breath will be taken in a free nation. Loosing isn’t an option, it’s a death sentence. A death sentence not just to ourselves; but to every person that can\u0027t fight for themselves and every future generation. The only way I’ll die is as a martyr. I won’t die a coward. I’ll die fighting for everyone who can’t fight. I’ll die fighting for everything I believe in. I’ll die fighting to make a better world for my kids. I’ll die fighting for my rights. But I won’t die without changing the world. I’ll create a revolution, or die trying.  We will fight to win, not to change. And we will win. There’s no other option. We have to win to avenge all those who pointlessly lost their lives. We will avenge them and create a better world in their honour. They won’t die in vain. They can’t. We will avenge every single sibling. Every single missing and murdered indigenous woman in northern canada. Every black person shot by a cop for no reason. Every LGBT person kicked out a killed for their existence. Every abuse victim NONE OF THEM can have died in vain. If they died in vain, I lived in vain. They did not die for nothing. And we don’t fight for nothing. We fight for everything we hold dear. We fight for the martyrs. We fight for those we lost to abuse. We fight for those lost to suicide. We fight for those lost to homeless. We fight for those lost to shootings. We fight for those lost to our corrupt ‘justice’ system, where the only justice given is to those who are rich, white and straight. We fight for those who don’t have a voice. We fight to give a megaphone to those who have been silenced. We fight to give a home to those who have been forced out. We fight to give a family to those who have none left. We fight to give love to those who have lost hope. We fight to make a better world for those who don\u0027t feel like it can ever exist. We fight for the future and the past. We fight for ourselves. We fight for the weak. We fight for the silent. We fight for the abused. We fight for those who are afraid to speak out. We fight for the children that didn\u0027t choose to join a society that just puts them down. We fight for the powerless. We fight for the misfits. We fight for those who can’t fight for themselves. We fight to correct the corrupt government that can no longer support the people it claims to support. It is our duty as citizens and it is our right to remove those corrupt in power and replace them with people that have our best interests in mind! People who will fight to correct what is wrong. We fight for the people. We fight to win.  It\u0027s time to fight back. No more death to those who did nothing but exist in a world that doesn\u0027t care for them. Show that WE CARE and that we will stand up for those who felt like they had no one, that the system tries to convince have no one. NOW is the time to fight! We will find those who have been silenced and give them a voice. Find those who have been abused and give them power. We fight against abusers. We fight against cops. We fight against the rich. We fight against classism. We fight against the corrupt. We fight against those who have silenced others for the colour of their skin, or who they love, or who they ARE. We fight against silence. It is time to fight back against our oppressors. We will rise with our siblings on a new day where no one is afraid to be themselves. We will make our voices heard. We will rise against those who refuse to acknowledge our existence. We will rise and live as free people. We will not surrender. Surrender is no longer an option. We cannot back down.  We will rise with the sun on a new day marked with love and acceptance, not hate and corruption behind the guise of protection. Protection without freedom is tyranny. Everyone will be heard. Everyone will be valued. The government has a choice to make. Respect our existence or expect our resistance!",

  "@@reginan23 I\u0027ve read about a theory that says that Maude Ivory could be Katniss\u0027 grandmother since Lucy said that her cousin \"never forgets anything with a tune\" (same as Katniss). According to this, Ivory would have memorized her cousin\u0027s Hanging Tree song, then got married with Mr. Everdeen (grandfather, District 12) and got Mr Everdeen (father). This is how Katniss inherited her District 12 physical apparence, singer talent, lake knowledge and love for the mockingjays. This theory isn\u0027t confirmed but it is canon for me hahaha",

  "@@angela_aubrams  Snow from books has never hear Hanging Tree singing by Katniss. They didn\u0027t put the song to propos. How do i know about it? Haymitch told Katniss, that they let Peeta hear the song singing by Katniss and he told he had already heared it before (Katniss\u0027s father). They were sure it was his real memory (not changed by Capitol),. because they didn\u0027t put the Hanging Tree song to propos and it has been never released. So in books the song wasn\u0027t even rebel anthem. It was more about Katniss-Peeta context. However, the change in movies was pretty good (even when i am.still \"books team\")",
  "@@reginan23 i think this little girl, little cousin of Lucy Gray was Katniss\u0027s grandma. All Lucy Gray\u0027s group.was too old to be her parents. But the little girl.matches perfectly becauce of.her age, voice, the knowledge about some.special.places in 12th district etc",
  "@@magdaazuka1953 that\u0027s well spotted! However, I really believe Snow saw it. I mean, I agree with you that Peeta didn\u0027t,  but I think that it was beacuse Snow wouldn\u0027t let him know anything about the Districts or Katniss (Peeta didn\u0027t even know about his family murdered). So I believe they kept all the propos from Peeta, but still, that the propos were seen in the Capitol. If they recorded Katniss singing it was definitely for a propo, and even if the Capitol people tried to avoid the emission so the people didn\u0027t see it, I think Snow would have seen it anyway since the workers must have shown Snow the videos so he knew more about the enemy\u0027s strategy. What do you think?",
  "@@angela_aubrams i read all three  books after watching the movies and i reminded them because of the 4th one - the Ballad, of course 🙂 That\u0027s why i catched some differences. I am 100% sure: In books Haymitch told Katniss, that people responsable for propos montage have never used the Hanging Tree Song in any propo. The record with Hanging Tree in Katniss version was used only with Peeta\u0027s treatment. Haymitch told that Capitol had no possibility to manipulate with that song, because it wasn\u0027t even released with any official material. And it is logical. No one knows the real meaning of that song and for sure 1st rebeliants (75 y ago) have never known the Hanging Tree Song, because it was written 10 years after 1st revolution. Now we are smartet, because we know the Ballad, but Coin, Pluthar, Haymitch and the rest didn\u0027t 🙂 Meanwhile, they had super super material with Finnic and his knowledge about Snow\u0027s secrets. In books the Hanging Tree song i shown more in Katniss-Peeta context. And the most improtant: if Snow had heard the version of Katniss, he would have certainly told Katniss about it in the last conversation before the execution.  this is that type of man. Meanwhile, no even one word or any allusion about it.  small SPOILER to the Ballad:  However, i read one interesting comentery theory (i am not for it, but  who.knows, maybe Collins.will push the things in that direction?): Someno wrote that Coin could be a daughter of Snow and Lucy Grey who found district 13 by an accident or sth. They (Coin and Snow had similar personality, so who knows?). For now i don\u0027t buy the theory, but who knows?",
  "@@angela_aubrams and another important thing.  If Snow had heard the recording of Katniss singing, the first thing he would have done was manipulate the song with Peeta\u0027s memories. We have to remember, that when Collins wrote The Hunger Games probably didn\u0027t think about Snow so much. His character was developed in the movies.  The books don\u0027t really mention him too much. However the movies made a great job and i think could be good inspiration to Ballad. Maybe Collins will find a way to show the Katniss version of the song in the future. But now the books show it as I described - Snow from books has never heard Katniss version of Hanging Tree",
  "@@angela_aubrams and when Collins was writting the Hunger Games the song was more to Peeta: \"met at midnight in the (...) tree\". Just like the song from the 75th arena. But at the same time it could also be a symbolic meeting with Snow, so everything is still fine",
  "@@angela_aubrams you know what the scariest part is? The last time Snow ever saw Lucy Gray was when she told him she was going to go looking for a type of flower.... called Katniss",
  "@@magdaazuka1953 omg I never thought about that! In the books the song was about Katniss and Peeta, I\u0027m shocked! Thank you so much for sharing!!",
  "@@livy456 oh WOW I didn\u0027t thought about that 😳😳",
  "@@livy456 good point, you\u0027re so right 👍👍👍",
  "@@angela_aubrams thanks to the films and after reading the Ballads, however, I think that this course (from Katniss-Peeta) can transfer (or has double meaning) to rebellion even in books if more books are written. there is some space to add a story to the symbol. eg. if Greasy Sae is Lucy Gray (as some say), she can have some reason (personal or no)  to stop producers from sending the song to the districts and the Capitol. so the rebellion does not hear the anthem, but the readers know it is a symbol. Especially since Peeta\u0027s recovery was very important to Katniss and it was this song that was a breakthrough in his treatment, so it was already a victory in some way",
  "@@magdaazuka1953 I don\u0027t think Lucy Greay is either Sae or Coin. Mainly becaude if she was Sae, people would have recognised her and she never planned to come back. Also, it is confirmed that one of the musicians playing at Finnick and Annie\u0027s wedding at District 13 belonged to Lucy Gray\u0027s \"family\", so she would have been recognised there too (I know that is not a strong reason, but more important: I believe Lucy Gray would have never killed children nor started to act as Snow). I only agree to the theory that says that Maude is Katniss\u0027s grandmother (for me that is already a fact hahaha)",
  "@@angela_aubrams 🙂 Also, I am not strongly for this theory (Lucy Gray cared a lot about her appearance and I do not remember Sae, but I imagine her differently - because of the appearance, actually more like Coin / Coin mother), but I do not exclude that it may turn out to be real.  Sae knew how to cook a lot of strange products - maybe she had to learn it during her escape. She was the one who started the District 12 fundraiser for Katniss and Peeta in the arena.  Sae had also attended important District 13 headquarters meeting and Katniss had no idea why (but in my opinion she was there because people who knew Katniss well had to appear at the meeting, because it was about propaganda strategies). After Katniss returned to 12, she cooked for her and Katniss wondered again who had commissioned her to do so.  She was visiting Katniss with her grandchildren, so she was at an age Lucy Gray could be.  However, if Lucy Gray had returned to 12 as Sae, the other members of Covey would certainly have kept her identity a secret.  Katniss is the narrator in the books (the Trylogy), so we don\u0027t know how Sae and possibly another Covey member talked to each other in private.  In any case, these are fan\u0027s guesses for now, and Collins\u0027 plan and imagination may be going in a different direction.  I would like to know other aspects of this story.  I can even wait a long time if they are surprisingly and correct structured 🙂",
  "@@magdaazuka1953 I\u0027ve thought about that too but I prefer to think that Sae was nice to Katniss just because she really cared for her as a friend and not because she knew they were family. I mean it would be nice, but I prefer to think that Katniss deserved people\u0027s love even if they weren\u0027t relatives. Besides, I think that Sae and Haymitch are there to be the opposite of Mrs. Everdeen: her family didn\u0027t protect her, but she got new family that was not blood-related. This is why I believe Sae loved her just because she deserved love, without the excuse of being family. I dont think Im explaining myself properly but I hope you can understand somehow what I mean",
  "@@angela_aubrams i totally agree. i like how Katniss was built as a character and she deserved it. I imagine Sae in absolutly difrent way than I think about Lucy Gray. Lucy Gray cared much more about her apperance and was more majestic. I would rather belived that she is Coin or Coin\u0027s mother. But in my personal opinion we should never get any knowledge about the future of Lucy Gray, because of the Ballad about Lucy Gray\u0027 name. I hope Collins will not hurry with  writting a new book. I can wait, if continuation is really good",
  "I just finished the book. I can\u0027t actually describe my feelings. I loved it, but I wanted more! It just wasn\u0027t enough for me. And it\u0027s ending is devastating. I know it couldnt work between them and ofc Snow would follow his will for power in order to become the man we saw in the first books/movies, but the way things ended is just..I dunno, I\u0027m so sad to be honest, even though I loved the book...Hope it gets it\u0027s own movie in 2022/2023 and more books to follow from Collins",

  "*Spoilers from The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes* 🌹: This song, written by Lucy Gray Baird (the first District 12 victor), narrates the execution of Arlo Chance, a miner and a rebel who was hanged by the District 12 Peacekeepers for being responsable of an explosion in the mines that killed three people ( _They strung up a man they say they murdered three_ ). His last words, to a girl named Lil are “Run! Run, Lil! Ru-“ ( _Where a dead man called out for his love to flee_ ) after his death, jabberjays (they were not yet extinct) along with mockingjays hauntingly repeat his final moments. Coriolanus Snow is present in this event and in the performance on this song at the Hob, as he was punished to become a Peacekeeper for cheating in the 10th Hunger Games, he mentored Lucy Gray and he chose District 12 to fulfill his punishment, as he fall in love with Lucy.",

  "@@sierrapenner4805 I don\u0027t know if you heard that last year here in Chile in October, there was an uprising of the country against politicians. Everything was a union from the poor person to the person who had money, until one day the idea of ​​eliminating the constitution we have and making a new one came up. Since then, the left (especially communist politicians) have spread a hate speech that if it had not been for the pandemic, we would have gone straight to a civil war. Now it is a war of the one who does not have against the one who has (I speak of common people) In a few more days we will have the vote to see if a change of constitution is accepted or not, it is most likely that the one we have will be eliminated and we will start from a blank sheet. And people believe that that will solve everything and the worst thing is that the politicians themselves wrote it. What happened in October was not \"spontaneous\" at all, it was an attempted coup by the left and our president, who is from the right, now does everything they order him to do. So Chile, once the best country in Latin America, is now falling. Imagine, my parents are doctors and people attack me for that. And many people like me are threatened with fear and violence because we were only lucky to be in a better economic situation. That is what we are getting here in Chile.",

The underlying strings and brass is slow, long notes. The whole is a crescendo from one person a capella to a full orchestra and choir blasting away. You can\u0027t escape the sadness of the minor key. While it pivots around a \u0027necklass of hope\u0027, you can hear in the music you\u0027re for the \u0027rope\u0027, but it\u0027s okay.

  "And now,for a little grim historical background of this song that is being favorited by so many people who may or may not be completely aware of its dark history. The Original title and name of this song was called the \"Song of the Rope\",but the Game Master of the Hunger Games changed it to the \"Song of Hope\"! This is actually a song of Death\" and it celebrates the death of a certain group of oppressed people who were hung in trees for the entertainment of the Americans as well as the British who relished in the murders of these people and turned them into the Hunger Games! Before some of you develop misplaced as well as uncalculated anger.....Please allow me to explain....These people have always been an oppressed people who were dis-shoveled into ghettos and projects which were then filled up with drugs in order to form a dependency which was then cultivated into violence, and warfare among them causing them to kill one another. The original Architects of this undesirable Construct were the founders and designers of these games! As a matter of fact, this very societal construct was built upon the premise of the GAMES,which were actually a Game of Death which the architects thought would be both profitable and entertaining. They sought to make sport of a certain group of people who were extremely poor, dis-advantaged and destitute! They would first make sport of them before they were murdered,while inviting and announcing to the entire community to come and watch the grisly affair which was about to take place in their town. They would EXCITEDLY ask one another...Are you coming to the Hanging TREE???...  The people then would come from all parts and gather from miles around to witness this wicked deed,bringing with them their wives, and their sons and daughters! They then would castrate the helpless victim and set him on fire while he hung from the tree and It would then be written up in the town newspaper.  When this thing was finally made illegal ,the Architects of the GAMES were so angry that they sought another way to make sport of these people so they could continue the GAMES in order to be entertained by them. They decided to hold a draft from each of these poor and downtrodden Black districts in order put to them back into the GAMES! They would offer them food and prize money contracts in order to encourage them to participate in the GAMES so they could feed and house their poor families. They would even give them a contract and assign them to a team and give them a jersey or uniform with a number on it. They did these things in order to foster a sense of brotherhood with the teams so they could create for them an artificial family from whom they would receive all their love and camaraderie. The Architects and the Owners did this because they knew they would become LOYAL to the TEAMS and thereby become dedicated to the GAMES! Thru this they would control the players and would inevitably decide the fate of these gladiators,while simultaneously prospering greatly by their continued drafting of these people into their GAMES. They would even place bets on them and decide weather or not to trade them based on their own performances and if they caused the team WIN or LOSS.  The  most unfortunate fact of the matter is...The OWNERS WOULD ALL BE WINNERS while the players would all be LOSERS! Nowadays, instead of HANGING the player of the GAMES from the trees when they have worn out their usefulness,they do things a little different. Now when a player or gladiator has worn out his usefulness,but he has made his owners a sufficient enough MONEY then they will hold a public ceremony inviting EVERYONE to come and watch the players jersey be hung in EFFIGY from a TREE!..The title should be ostensibly changed to... how \"To Kill a Mocking Bird\".....That\u0027s all...Shalom",

  "I wrote this for the song. Hope y\u0027all like it. The Hanging Tree Mississippi 1851, a decade before the U.S Civil War would begin, plantations were scattered across the entire state. Slaves working the fields had become a very common sight at the time. Two of the larger cotton plantations in the Delta sat one beside the other. Both were slave plantations but the larger of the two had nearly twice the number of slaves working the fields.  As far as plantations went, these neighboring cotton farms were as modern as any might have been. Offering freedom to slaves that worked out ten years in the cotton, they could leave or stay after ten years. The slaves were even living in share cropper type homes built on both farms. Black women didn\u0027t work the cotton fields, they worked in the big houses on plantations, raising the gardens, cooking all the food and raising the children.  On the smaller of the two farms the owner was a widower and had only the one son. The plantation master was almost constantly away on business after losing his wife. Leaving the eight year old boy to be raised by nannies. The same ladies who worked in the big house.  The farm next door was ran by an older couple whose own children had long since moved to Biloxi. But the farm\u0027s slaves had more than a dozen children. One was a girl about seven years old.  The Hanging Tree tells the ending of a story, a story about an only son of a plantation owner, a young white boy, meeting the prettiest little black girl in all of Mississippi; and neither of them ever being the same again.  The two kids had been warned against playing together or even associating but neither understood or cared about why. Eventually finding out about his son and his young live, the boy\u0027s father told him he\u0027d forget about the girl and one day marry a white woman and inherit the cotton plantation.  But they were nearly inseparable growing up, and having gotten older, the two began realizing for them to ever be together they\u0027d have to flee Mississippi. Planning on leaving the country if they had too and find a way to be married. The boy had reached the age of fourteen, and his \u0027Juliet\u0027 was herself thirteen, when rumors of the two\u0027s relationship had spread across the county and beyond.  In that place, just years before the war of North and South, it wasn\u0027t long before threats were made. Directed towards the slaves living and working on both plantations, the two teens decided to pack what little they could take and meet at midnight at the fork of the main road near the hanging tree. A meeting spot they\u0027d used for years setting opposite of the road away from the corn and cotton fields. As fate would have it, seven riders had been traveling the main roads late at night. Three of them worked the largest of the two farms for the older plantation owners. And after hearing rumors that the star crossed teenagers were planning to run off together, the men made plans on catching them.  Although only fourteen years old, the son of the neighboring plantation owner was a crack shot with a rifle, and never left home without it. He came upon the group of riders under the full moon. Seeing three of them riding in the corn field, circling the young girl, cursing her and yelling with lassos being thrown down a round her. In an instant the boy \u0027referred to as a man in the song\u0027 stepped out into the open firing three shots from his rifle, instantly killing the three riders who were attempting to chase or run down the girl he loved.  He tried to get to her and escape into the corn, but the four riders that were holding back quickly captured the lad. With no loyalties to either plantation decided he\u0027d be hanged, right there in the oldest hanging tree in all of the Mississippi Delta.  Being far enough from the road and watching the lynching unfold from the edge of the corn field, the young girl\u0027s escape was guaranteed but she was frozen to spot. In the moonlight, the young lady could see one of the dead rider\u0027s rifle shining up from the trampled corn. The boy yelled for her to run, knowing part of him at least could be free if she lived; but she never considered it. She knew for both of them to be free, it\u0027d have to be in death \"wearing a necklace of hope, side by side\".  Having never used a gun in her life, she picked it up and chose her own fate right then. \"Strange things did happen there\", seven years of meetings between sweethearts, the murder of three, and another was the threat of death being nothing compared to what two of Mississippi\u0027s children meant to each other.",

But why did they have to turn \"wear a necklace of rope\" into \"wear of necklace of hope\" is beyond me. \"Necklace of rope\" has such a deep meaning in the books, far deeper that it would imply at first glance. The movie simply does an injustice to the song. Her voice will always remind me of the books, though. Haunting.",
  "I mean technically \"necklace of hope\" can be just as deep/metaphorical as \"necklace of rope\". Because hope can kill/strangle you as well (as we\u0027ve seen several times in the movies). But in general I\u0027d agree with you, the song in the books is more impactful.  I think it\u0027s pretty safe to say, that i a way (as it is the case with many other films on books) the books will always be better than the movies. (Quite simply for the fact that more things are left up for imagination in books)",

The scene was so simple, yet it was so epic and pure. For a moment,  it was like being part of the world and you were about to join the resistance. And Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s unaltered voice really added to the required mood. I was simply blown away. The remix on the other hand is a total blasphemy. It reduces a beautiful song to a throwaway dance mix. Autotuning Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s voice for that was the biggest insult.",

  "Not really. The one who started revolution was Rue. She was the real sinsajo. Why? you may ask. Ok. She was the one who broke the unspoken rule of not making teams with different districts. She was the one who went against the system. Then Katniss just followed. But the first trully rebel was Rue.  What Pretty Little Liars says its true. She compared to the rest of the country, basically, was small. I\u0027m not saying she wasn\u0027t important. She was to the rest of the people like a focal point for a ballerina. This people has been suffering a lot for so long but didn\u0027t say/do anything until they got Katniss. Her role was to give spirits, strength and hope. People may be angry and even have decided to do something about it, but they wont if they don\u0027t have the feeling that they are supported. They needed to know they weren\u0027t the only ones.  And that feeling, if you ask me, knowing that there\u0027s someone telling you to keep on it makes you cry and rise up. And you walk out the streets and do what you need to fight against the criminals that are profaning the sacred place of the presidency, make them pay for all the deaths and start to heal and make your country a better place.  Now, coming back to Katniss. As I said her role big, but small compared to what the other people did.",

  "It\u0027s interesting. I\u0027ve seen many people here have been touched by this piece of music emotionally in some way or another. However, I have not seen many credit the reason for this emotional connection. I\u0027ve seen people, rightfully, commend Lawrence\u0027s voice and the majesty of the scene this music evokes. However, I have neither seen nor heard any mention of James Newton Howard. This man put me close to tears with his score of King Kong. He put me through a whirlwind of emotions in the first and second hunger games films. He caught my imagination for his work in the film Blood Diamond. He is the only reason I waded through Snow White and the Huntsman, and I will always remember his partnership with Zimmer for the Dark Knight. Film Music composers are the unsung heroes of film. This scene is impactful for one reason alone to me. His subtle early introduction of the violin accompaniment. His gradual swell of horns, the use of soprano singers, added to the horns at the song\u0027s conclusion add a haunting tone to the reflective cellos and violins that have developed, altered and enhanced the melody to it\u0027s limit. The change from quiet to loud, the seamless transition from soloist to choir to instruments. Howard is a master at his trade. His manipulation of the melody and use of instruments and voices is what causes you to feel sorrow and reflection upon hearing the music. The lyrics are good. However, it is the music that is genius. Everyone here has praised Lawrence. However, I see few praising the maker of your true emotional response. Lawrence sang, Howard composed. Lawrence may have made the melody, but a melody alone is not strong enough to make someone cry or laugh or shout in anger or triumph. True music needs accompaniment, instruments and the manipulation of the melody you know and love. Howard delivers in ways none of you even notice. Howard is an unsung hero, just like Hans Zimmer, Howard Shore, Harry Gregson Williams, John Williams, the late James Horner and so many others. This piece speaks to me, but only because of James Newton Howard. All I ask of you, if you have made it this far down my wall of text, is to credit him and thank him for his majestic masterpiece here, in equal measure to Lawrence, because he is the one to me who needs this acknowledgement most. He is the one who can replicate the emotions we have felt with this piece. His composition is what we love. Songs aren\u0027t just about lyrics or melody. They are about the whole thing.

  "Well it was inspired by \"Strange fruit\" by Billie Holiday from what i have heard and that means it has at least SOME connection to KKK... To me it feels more like a protest song against Trump though",
  "how the fuck does this have anything to do with trump. do you just feel the need to throw your political views in the middle of everything. just enjoy the song",
  "If it is related to \"Strange fruit\" then it is clearly not inclined towards kkk...It is rather a song claiming freedom against oppression.",
  "in the book it\u0027s about some murderer who was sentenced to death but was calling to his lover to come hang with him??",
  "Not sure but an innocent guy got I hanged for apparently murdering people and he was saying to his lover don\u0027t go to the tree because the people who killed him would kill her too. Well that\u0027s what I got from the lyrics but could be wrong",
  "THIS IS THE EXPLANATION FROM THE BOOK ITSELF “but it’s not until the third verse that “The Hanging Tree” begins to get unnerving. You realize the singer of the song is the dead murderer. He’s still in the hanging tree. And even though he told his lover to flee, he keeps asking if she’s coming to meet him. The phrase Where I told you to run, so we’d both be free is the most troubling because at first you think he’s talking about when he told her to flee, presumably to safety. But then you wonder if he meant for her to run to him. To death. In the final stanza, it’s clear that that’s what he’s waiting for. His lover, with her rope necklace, hanging dead next to him in the tree.”",

  "I sing this to my nephew to get him settled in for a nap. It started as an accident; it was stuck in my head and is easy to sing, and he listened and fell asleep very quickly. I keep trying other lullabies, something not quite as dark, but the hanging tree has never failed me yet. I like to think that when he\u0027s older and asks me why I sang the hanging tree to him, I can either tease him that it was the only thing that would work, or else introduce him to a beautiful series.",

  "@jaxx2262 Hi, yes it is for a mixed choir. I myself am more the piano player than the singer but i know the basics. I am Bass and therefore the arrangement is pretty deep. I have no problem in sharing but it is only in my head and i dont realy know how i should send it to you. Let me know if you have an idea (btw sorr for my englisch, im a 16 year old german student). Also the lyrics dont fit perfektly to the melody of the previous song so i had to change it a little bit. As I said, regarding the singing part i dont realy know how it sounds because i havend played it with my choir jet but it should fit regarding the harmony.",

It was unmoving and flat, when it could have been like Catching Fire or Mockingjay part I. No one was half as believable as in Mockingjay Part I (except for Josh, who was great). I can\u0027t believe they finished in such a low note of a movie when they had a cult saga in the making.",
  "I loved Mockingjay: Part 2. A fitting end to a great franchise. But I do agree that The Hanging Tree is by far the best moment in the whole series. When they play it over the attack on the dam, it is truly epic and moving. As I am only 13 years old, when I look back on my earlier years in the future, one of the main movies I will think of is The Hunger Games series. Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing actress, a beautiful woman, a complete badass, and surprisingly has a great voice. Also, I am not ashamed to admit, she is my main celebrity crush. These films may not be perfect, but I love them anyway, for their future nostalgia and their grand, epic scale. Long live Katniss Everdeen.",

  "There are 3 key points that I\u0027d like to bring up 1. If one would bother doing some research, they\u0027d know that Jennifer Lawrence has very little skill in singing. In an interview with David Letterman, she described herself as a “a tone-deaf Amy Winehouse.”  2. For those arguing AGAINST autotune, it\u0027s not as if autotune is used only to make someone sound perfect. It usually is, though going hand-in-hand with that, they must make sure that they keep the pitch. That\u0027s what they seem to do in this song. Otherwise, they purposely alter the song to make it fit the storyline better. Katniss is an amateur singer with some talent, but not very much. This could easily imply that she has pitch, but little else. Another point stemming from this is that if they released the song with her going flat and sharp every other note, would people enjoy it? It\u0027d actually sound drastically different, especially during the transition from acapella to with music. The incorrect notes would be identified far more easily.  3. Even if it was completely natural, she is nowhere near being a great singer. I\u0027d applaud her ability to keep pitch, but that\u0027s nowhere near what it means to sing. Breath control, diction. If one doesn\u0027t breathe at the right times, it sounds choppy, and it easily causes you to flat your notes. If you don\u0027t control your breathing well, your words don\u0027t sound as well either. One could say that I am a critic, and I do seem to have more qualification in saying whether she is or isn\u0027t a \"good singer,\" so to speak, as I do study vocal music. As an example, if she went somewhere like a choir districts competition, she\u0027d more than likely get a 3, which is not that good at all. A 1 gets you a medal, and you go to state, like I did.  In conclusion, if that were her natural voice, no editing, minus sound balancing in order to make sure every part is heard, she\u0027d have plenty of potential that just needs to be trained, but the reality of the matter is that not many care for the voice of a tone-deaf Amy Winehouse.",

He might not word it nicely, but his points sounded valid, and in the end, he never said that J-lawrence is a terrible singer, and in a way complimented her for her (possible) talent in singing. It\u0027s just that she might not train herself in singing since acting is her primary career. At the end of the day most people wont judge J-lawrence in singing anyway, and this comment was quite educative.",
  "Nat Breen I made my comment because there are plenty of people out there who remain uneducated and honestly believe she has an amazing talent of singing, when she does not. It was never an attempt at self-promotion. What is there to gain from my comment? Likes? Subscribers? Is it supposed to make me feel better about myself in any way? It has absolutely no effect on my image on youtube, nor does it affect my opinion of myself. Also, maybe you ought to be rereading my initial comment. I didn\u0027t critique her actual abilities. The closest I came to doing so was with my third point. In such, I just stated more legitimate facts. I went so far as to say that if that were her natural voice, without editing, she\u0027d definitely have a lot of potential. That was the closest I got to critiquing her actual voice. No, it was not necessary, however, having an opinion, one way or the other, is not necessary either. Regardless, speaking in an informative manner for everyone\u0027s sake seems to have worked fairly well, as far as I am concerned. ",
  "Dude, I wasn\u0027t critiquing you at all. I don\u0027t know anything at all about music or singing, I was simply asking why you felt it necessary to make your comment given that it was entirely unnecessary and unwanted.",
  "I never said anything about you critiquing me. No one said it was unwanted until after the fact. On the flip side, your comment was unnecessary, and your negative attitude was inherently unwanted. I honestly don\u0027t see why you took the time to comment on here, as if I\u0027m going to delete because someone says they don\u0027t like being educated.",

  "+Isabella Yodice you fail to support your \"argument.\" instead, you support my point. It\u0027s not insecurity. It\u0027s simply knowing that you don\u0027t possess much skill in particular field. I don\u0027t know why you guys have such a problem with the fact that she knows and admits her lack of skill, and desire to treat such as false.",
  "I do not have to prove anything to you and neither does she. Micheal Jordan didn\u0027t think that he was any good at basketball at a point in time, but look at him now. You don\u0027t and never will know everything about a person even though you may think that you do. Don\u0027t judge someone that you do not even know. Just accept that she did a good job with the song and get on with your life. The sooner the better. Also, stop acting like a jerk. People can have their opinions on how someone sings, it is called an opinion. Just get off your high horse and realize that you are not always right.",
  "+Isabella Yodice +Isabella Yodice I\u0027m not on a high horse or anything. They used autotune, she does not have much talent in that field. Basketball and singing are not comparable. Basketball is something you learn. Singing starts with talent. Take it from a music student, it\u0027s not an opinion. Either you have good vocals fit for higher amounts of control and can be trained to improve, or you don\u0027t. There\u0027s no in between.",

It feels more real, and like it has real meaning, something anyone would sing to make themselves feel better, or like in the bombing scene in the movie, gear themselves up for war.  Not a pretty tune sung on stage to the masses.  Not that I don\u0027t like that kind of music, but for this, I\u0027m glad Lawrence sang it, and even though it seems they may have fiddled with her voice a bit to make it sound \u0027better\u0027 I\u0027d still listen to this version more than a hundred \u0027perfected\u0027 versions.",

  "+RegentofSparta Well the story has been done before as every Battle Royale fan will tell you. The characters are not particularly compelling. They\u0027re all very serious but also very dull. There\u0027s no flair to the writing. the only character I really enjoyed was Philip Seymour Hoffman\u0027s and I think that\u0027s mostly due to his talent as an actor than his writing. It revolves around Katniss. Which would be fine if she was a good character. I much preferred Lawrence in X-Men because as good an actress I\u0027m sure she is, her character writing is just lacklustre in these films. Furthermore the whole \u0027bleak dystopian future\u0027 thing is very done. If it was more brutal it would be better but it\u0027s just Dystopia Light. I want full fat Dystopia.",
  "There are subtle differences though are there not between Battle Royale and Hunger Games? Anyway I will agree on the fact that more brutalness would get its point across - however its hampered by the 12 certificate there are several scenes where I think they could really have tuned it up (two really good examples are the carnage in district 12 and the story Finnick tells in a rebel broadcast about sexual exploitation ) Disagree on characters though but oh well.",
  "+William Essex I\u0027ve watched both (BR and HG) and even if similar, the feeling is different (at least to me). Probably the movies are not the cup of tea of everybody, and that\u0027s  okay :) Personally I loved the books better, they are much more detailed and you can get way more into the characters.",

I\u0027m not saying they\u0027re horrible, but if you aren\u0027t changing the tone, why should i pick that one over this one? It\u0027s death and murder we\u0027re talking about here, cover artists.

  "+Sarah R at first i didn\u0027t like that Suzanne killed off many characters in the book but now i realize they were killed for a reason that is actually true. In war anything can happen and you never know what to expect. Like Finnick, he was killed off to show that even people with family can die. He was recently wed and had a baby on the way. Prim died to show that although we may think our family is safe, their life can be taken unexpectedly. Coin died because she wasn\u0027t who everyone thought she was. She was the districts version of Snow. All she wanted was to use Katniss so bring her power. Anyway, Katniss couldn\u0027t react to Prim\u0027s death; in the book the bombing was very unexpected and when Katniss got up to help those kids she noticed medics rushing in from D13. She automatically spotted Prim and yelled her name and right as Prim says the name Katniss... she gets blow to bits. Katniss described herself as the girl who was now on fire with no sister... then blacks out. she couldn\u0027t react.",

And it was painful to watch that part of the movie when it came out... Cause I knew that fateful moment would come... And it did, sadly... Made me feel like crap again... Prim\u0027s death was surprising to say the least in the books, and sad too, but less in the movies for me as I knew it was coming (and was trying my best not to tell it to the friends I was watching it with who didn\u0027t read the book lol)... The last book isn\u0027t the best in my opinion, because of the sadness, the pain and the psychological torture they\u0027re all going through (and Finnick\u0027s death, seriously Suzanne that\u0027s not cool), but I guess it\u0027s just like a real war/revolution... Not fun... It was a mature book, sad and painful, but mature and interesting... I still love that after Prim\u0027s death that was like the trigger for her mental breakdown after all she\u0027s been through, after her talk with snow, during Coin\u0027s speech, she\u0027s like... \"Why the f*** should I keep listening to your bs, you\u0027ve taken everything from me, so now just shut up, f*** you\" and shoots that arrow in her face, goes \"f*** this, I\u0027m out\" and goes living with Peeta who\u0027s the symbol of the quiet life she now aspires to live, with someone who shares her pain and traumatizing experiences...",

  "Well, this is my interpretation of the song. It may not be correct, but i am also writing this to discuss with other people and see what they think the song means. Some things i will state may be considered a given by some, but i would not feel good if i left them out. Sorry for the length of my comment...   ~At first the singer is like an observer to what happens. This can be identified by the use third person (\"he murdered\",\"he called out\"). Later, first person is used and it\u0027s revealed the singer is the dead man. ~The audience is in my opinion the man\u0027s loved one. About the singer and its audience, i will say more later... ~It seems to me that the Hanging Tree is every place that people get hurt or even die while fighting against the Capitol. It could mean the whipping posts or execution stands but i think it\u0027s mostly about the rebellion (first or second?). Personally, i think the last four lines of each verse are reinforcing my opinion. \"Strange things did happen here. No stranger would it be. If we met at midnight. In the hanging tree.\" Stranger things are the tortures and murders done by the Capitol. It wouldn\u0027t be stranger if the people turned against the Capitol and murdered some Peacekeepers too. ~By saying \"Are you coming to the tree?\", the singer invites its audience to come to the Tree. So, because the Tree is the rebellion, the dead man is every person that has stood against the Capitol. It makes more sense if we consider that every person that goes against the Capitol puts its life in danger (and is fully aware of it), so it is an already dead man. The loved one is every other person in the world that hasn\u0027t taken part in the rebellion (yet). Why loved one? I think it\u0027s a way to show the love among the districts\u0027 citizens. Each two of them are united, like two lovers, not just two ordinary people, but a couple with common needs, desires and goals. ~Midnight is the darkest time of a day (night actually...). It is also the time that most terrifying things (ghosts and such) are coming alive and a rebellion is terrifying for President Snow and its consequences would be dark for him. Last but not least, at midnight the day ends and a new one is coming, so if the lovers-citizens met they could bring an end to this dark era-day and give rise to a new era of peace and prosperity for everyone. The above are about the lyrics repeated in every verse. Now let me tell you my opinion about the rest. ~\"Where they strung up a man. They say murdered three.\" So it\u0027s obvious the Capitol has killed a rebel. I can\u0027t but focus on \"they say\". The man probably hasn\u0027t done anything or at least anything against someone non-Capitol. He is accused of false things. The song indicates the rulers of Panem are killing innocent people. ~\"Where the dead man. Called out for his love to flee.\" Most people would say that the dead man tried to save his loved one, telling her to run away. I will go against this and say that he tried to save her, by telling her to join the rebellion. This is the only way for her (remember the loved one is actually everyone!) to be saved. If she run away she would simply survive, but if she fought she would LIVE!!! ~\"Where i told you to run. So we \u0027d both be free.\" It is just like the two lines i analyzed above, so please allow me to rest a little bit... ~\"Wear a necklace of rope. Side by side with me.\" The rebel invites everyone to join him in his war against the Capitol and to offer their lives just like him. I dont think the fact that the song accompanied the rebels in their greatest attack against the Capitol (during the first 3 movies), where so many people sacrificed their lives. This however could be countered by saying the lyrics were changed to \"necklace of HOPE\". Even though i read somewhere that the song is banned in Panem at least since Katniss was a little kid, so many people could know of its original lyrics. It has only been a week since i started watching the Hunger Games and i haven\u0027t read any of the books, so forgive me for any mistakes i have made and also for any grammar,syntax or spelling mistakes, since english is not my mother tongue. Thank you for your time and i hope for some answers to which i will happily response, Chris",

  "The hanging tree is a symbol of oppression that\u0027s thousands of years old..  It\u0027s about the tyranny of the minority (the nobility) versus freedom/nationalism (the commoner).. For example, Christ was hanged from a tree.  The most famous hanging tree was Tyburn (or hanging tree) in England.  It was synonymous with capital punishment by power of the nobility without trial, it having been the principal place for execution of London criminals and convicted traitors, including many religious and political martyrs.The first recorded execution took place at a site next to the stream in 1196. William Fitz Osbert, the populist leader of the poor of London, was cornered in the church of St Mary le Bow. He was dragged naked behind a horse to Tyburn, where he was hanged. In 1537, Henry VIII used Tyburn to execute the ringleaders of the Pilgrimage of Grace, including Sir Nicholas Tempest, one of the northern leaders of the Pilgrimage and the King\u0027s own Bowbearer of the Forest of Bowland. His daughter Queen Mary burned her opponents at Tyburn.  Later Tyburn was eulogized as a place of martyrs and freedom riders and thus moved to NewGate by the Hanovers, who kept their executions secret.  Ida Wells used the aspect of the hanging tree in her famous essays on lynching of men/women of color.  To narrow the scope of the hanging tree to just American slavery is an injustice to men and women all over the world who have fought against tyranny.  Today, injustice plagues women in the Middle East; young men/women who struggle to secure a livelihood; and a host of tyranny be it political or religious (like ISIS), or a corrupt and self serving government. ",

The White man settled this country...The Hanging Tree was not ONLY used in relation to slaves BUT it was common punishment of yesteryear for ANYONE... This movie is NOT about Black oppression but a futuristic (and even now) society of inequality and the attempts to right the wrongs that are even being done in the present day towards White, Black or ANY race... Seems that there\u0027s always a big uproar that the ONLY oppression in this country is towards Blacks... WRONG...",

  "+Andrew Pratt Look up Agenda 21. The districts are very similar.",
  "+Vivian Brody I never said that.  So your argument is that if the lowest income earners aren\u0027t paying taxes, then the highest earners shouldn\u0027t either.  Good plan!  Also, yes I\u0027m fairly sure they don\u0027t pay more taxes than the rich, because then they\u0027d have to pay the entirety of their income and go in debt to pay the amount high income earners are paying in taxes, but % wise, they pay similarly. On the other hand, my point is, and this comes from someone who earns a lot of money, that higher income earners have much more discretionary income.  Most of my excess money goes towards making more money in property investments (which I then pay property taxes on, damn it) and other types of investments.  However, I don\u0027t need that to survive whatsoever. For those who don\u0027t owe any federal income tax at the end of the year, they sometimes aren\u0027t even making enough to cover necessities.  The only way they don\u0027t have to pay federal income tax is if they work and make less than $20K, or those who don\u0027t make any money at all.  However, those getting the EITC, still pay payroll, state, and muni taxes so there isn\u0027t a per se aspect.  THEY DO PAY TAXES.  They just don\u0027t have an extra $100K to pay those taxes with.  So for example, if I make $20K-payroll- $0tax, I have $20K-payroll tax in disposable income.  If I make $100K-payroll tax-$22,331(22.33% effective rate)\u003d$77,669-payroll tax disposable income.  That is assuming single and no deductions which is very unlikely.  Assuming necessities cost $20K, then I\u0027ve still got $57,669 for houses, electronics, boats, cars, and more.  What horrible punishments! I highly doubt you make $400K+ which is the only point at which you start really paying a higher rate that actually sways the effective rate, and there are plenty of deductions and ways around that with special dividend income taxes, etc.  While we\u0027re arguing about this, the rest of the world is kicking our butt in every per-capita economic metric.  What is your solution to taxes though really.  Even if you take all of the $20K earner\u0027s income, you\u0027re not getting as much in taxes as you would from the $100K earner.  Success doesn\u0027t mean you shouldn\u0027t have to pay taxes, but you still end up with much more money even after taxes.  I\u0027ll take that kind of punishment all day.  The sad thing is rich people tricked you into making these crazy arguments for them with Tea Party nonsense.  I truly pity you. TL;DR If you\u0027re paying tons in taxes, you\u0027re making tons, and you\u0027ll have tons left after taxes.",
  "+MOC991 And I am saying that punishing someone for being successful by making them pay a higher percentage in taxes is unconstitutional, contrary to common sense, and bad for the country. And I have experience in having a bit of overtime put me in the next higher bracket so that most of what i should have gotten more is eaten by taxes-- to feed a bloated government which has gotten too big for its breeches and forgotten its place.

Moreover, they felt they had done their part DURING said wars, fighting alongside the redcoats (and teaching them how to survive warfare in the New World).

The words literally mean come die with me so we can have our freedom. I just feel as if playing this on the radio makes it just seem like a fun, cool song and less meaningful. Idk that\u0027s just my opinion. I kinda wish we had a somber, acapella, non cut or tuned version of when Jen sang this. THAT would be the true song. THAT would be the true power of words.",

  "Isn\u0027t that funny though? They\u0027ve made remixes of it, too. They\u0027ve altered it to make it different, and it makes the message in the song less important - it makes it mean less. When you think about it, isn\u0027t that what the hunger game\u0027s government would do to make the song less important? Less meaningful? Our government is doing the same thing. Our government reflects the capitol in the hunger games. Makes you rethink your whole life doesn\u0027t it.",

  "I completely 100% agree with you! I thought it was just me who felt that way!",
  "There are two versions to the song. This version is obviously very powerful and is what is in the movie. The second version is a dance remix, that\u0027s what\u0027s played on the radio. The remix being played on the radio is somewhat a metaphor. If the song became popular among districts, and Panem had radio, the Capitol would DEFINITELY remix the song so people don\u0027t pay attention to the lyrics and don\u0027t think about its depth and instead just mindlessly hum it. It\u0027s genius.",

  "The Rebel Remix creeps me out because it reinforces how very Capitol-like our societies are. The Capitol would absolutely make a Rebel Remix, taking away the song\u0027s power by making it into a cheap pop song.",
  "Ddarra Smith To me what you wrote shows how little America knows what this song should feel like. You people didn\u0027t have to fight for your independence or freedom in such a long time that you really know nothing about it. Even the movie portrays poorly how an actual revolution would go down, because it simply is not how it works. A popular icon like Katniss would never be enough to start an event like that, it takes people who are desperate and miserable and who are willing to fight on their own not only for the encouragement of some celebrity. The song is great though. It reminds me of my country\u0027s revolution against communism in 1956. So yes, for us hungarians a revolution is not some distant idea, and that s why the movie\u0027s revolution is a distorted one, eventhough I enjoyed it very much And that you play it like some cool summer song is just sad",
  "rviktor66 but that song isn\u0027t really about revolution. It\u0027s rather an act of defiance towards the capitol. They\u0027d never sing a song like that. They don\u0027t know what real love feels like, to want your lover dead by your side cause life is much worse. And Katniss know that. That\u0027s why the song added fire to the revolution. People remembered that Katniss was still the Mockingjay, just as when she held those berries with Peta. Another act of defiance. And that\u0027s all they need to turn their weapons towards the capitol. So yes, the song itself isn\u0027t about revolution, but what it did, is.",
  "Rea J You are absolutely right. I never said that the song directly was about revolution But rarely is it one person who sparkles such thing, ibut rather a general discontent among the citizens and desperation. As I said... But of course maybe i am totally wrong. To me it still felt a bit off. ..Just a bit really, but i still think the movie and this song  are both great It seemed that Katniss was the main person who moved the whole thing,(again indirectly) however in real life it would be all the people together fighting against the opressing regime there wouldn\u0027t be one icon figure.  That\u0027s all.",
  "rviktor66 I agree Although people are weak without a leader, a person to guide them. I don\u0027t know if you read the books, if you didn\u0027t SPOILER ALEART, when snow is killed everyone thinks they\u0027re safe and everything is ok, but Coin wants to be in charge and want\u0027s discipline as in district 13 (after all how is she better than Snow if she was the one that suggested the final Hunger Games to torture Capitol people?) And Katniss realised who was the real enemy. People needed to work together instead of one on top if it all. It would all fall apart again.",
  "Rea J I see your point. There are always certain people who represent a group or are the faces of a movement. And people need some sort of guidance that is also true. But there is always a ready made group that a person can be the head of. (If there is such a person beacuse that is not always the case) One single individual cannot plant the seed of rebellion by one single act. Of course I mainly work with my nation\u0027s history here. So most probably it slightly differ from other countries like Poland for example. Let me again mention the revolution of \u002756 of Hungary. It was the university students who first sit together and later marched on the streets and organised demonstrations that townspeople attended there were more and more people and then the whole thing broke out into fightin and so on.But it was never one person. And again I\u0027m not saying the book\u0027s perceptions are completely wrong. It just lacks that experience other countries were unfortunate enough to have.",
  "rviktor66 Well, for Hungary that is true. But for my country, (Croatia) it\u0027s not quite true. People wanted freedom and independence from Hungary and Austria, but there was always someone that would start the revolution. Stjepan Radić, for example. He also did the demonstrations and people realised that they need to speak up. They then went to the train stations in their town(that people from Hungary made) and they broke the signs (they were all in hungarian, and the people that sold the tickets also spoke only hungarian, and the tickets themselves were more expensive for croatian people than the hungarian people) so yeah, they relised that they needed to do someting, and the revolution started. But again, there was always that one person that gave people hope and faith and moved them to fight for their country. So it only depends for the country I guess. And that proves that Katniss and the Panem situation is realistic and could be true.",
  "I guess you won this argument. Altough I still have some very little negative feelings towards the movie in this aspect I cannot come up with any further points to disagree with you. Also, let me thank you for your respectful and kind language dispite our nationalities and our shared history. I guess its a romanian and slovakian thing to bash us all the time with hateful stuff on the internet. It was nice discussing all this with you. Have a nice day :)",
  "rviktor66 You too. :)",
  "rviktor66 Nope, it\u0027s not a Romanian thing. There will be extremists and/or ill informed and/or ill intended people among all nations. (Or posts from people whose intentions are specifically to appear as such, in order to \"throw gas at the flame\" a.k.a. media manipulation or manipulation through any means available).  I was 23 when the most mediatized Romanian rebellion took place, and there *was* a face that united us all, albeit it was a face we were all against of. I can actually relate very well to Katniss\u0027s fear that her loved ones would be hurt or killed. For me, this movie is PTSD therapy :) and I completely agree with the initial poster +Ddarra Smith. I am honestly surprised that these books got published and more, that movies were made adapted from them. I am astonished that this topic is successful for the general public, mostly people who didn\u0027t live through rebellions. It is actually restoring my faith in humanity :) The reason I\u0027m posting is to acknowledge your dialog with +Rea J - hats off to you both - another restoring my faith in humanity moment. (Side note: viktor66, did you really miss the general discontent in the districts? Although it is more clear in the books, I don;t think it is missed in the movie) Also, for +Ddarra Smith, not to worry. If the seed of understanding was to live, destroying of this song will only make it stronger. A maimed song will not brainwash people into sheeple :)",

  "Hello all. I can\u0027t tag everyone who has replied or liked this comment so really whoever reads it will read it. When I found this song and my colleagues and I listened to it we all had different views on it. We decided to make it into a sociology experiment, one we could share with our students. I wrote a comment to sound as it it was written by a teenager and took a strong stand on the song (specifically the way it was sung) Ever since I have been collecting data weekly to see  how different people would anonymously react to this. I am going to use this data and these comments in a study write up, but all names, profiles, and times will not be included. Thank you all for being involved in the study. For anyone else considering replying please do so, I would love even more data to work with.",
  "A majority of you will not be used in the study, if you wish not to be ( even though everything will remain anonymous) please contact me. Thanks.",
  "Ddarra Smith What kind of study? I mean, for what? You are free to take my previous comments but I\u0027d just like to know. Wait, are you a troll? I am confused.",
  "Ddarra Smith i posted my idea at a comment too, but i just read about your experiment and i thought it could be nice to write it here too. So, here it is: Well, this is my interpretation of the song. It may not be correct, but i am also writing this to discuss with other people and see what they think the song means. Some things i will state may be considered a given by some, but i would not feel good if i left them out. Sorry for the length of my comment...   ~At first the singer is like an observer to what happens. This can be identified by the use third person (\"he murdered\",\"he called out\"). Later, first person is used and it\u0027s revealed the singer is the dead man. ~The audience is in my opinion the man\u0027s loved one. About the singer and its audience, i will say more later... ~It seems to me that the Hanging Tree is every place that people get hurt or even die while fighting against the Capitol. It could mean the whipping posts or execution stands but i think it\u0027s mostly about the rebellion (first or second?). Personally, i think the last four lines of each verse are reinforcing my opinion. \"Strange things did happen here. No stranger would it be. If we met at midnight. In the hanging tree.\" Stranger things are the tortures and murders done by the Capitol. It wouldn\u0027t be stranger if the people turned against the Capitol and murdered some Peacekeepers too. ~By saying \"Are you coming to the tree?\", the singer invites its audience to come to the Tree. So, because the Tree is the rebellion, the dead man is every person that has stood against the Capitol. It makes more sense if we consider that every person that goes against the Capitol puts its life in danger (and is fully aware of it), so it is an already dead man. The loved one is every other person in the world that hasn\u0027t taken part in the rebellion (yet). Why loved one? I think it\u0027s a way to show the love among the districts\u0027 citizens. Each two of them are united, like two lovers, not just two ordinary people, but a couple with common needs, desires and goals. ~Midnight is the darkest time of a day (night actually...). It is also the time that most terrifying things (ghosts and such) are coming alive and a rebellion is terrifying for President Snow and its consequences would be dark for him. Last but not least, at midnight the day ends and a new one is coming, so if the lovers-citizens met they could bring an end to this dark era-day and give rise to a new era of peace and prosperity for everyone. The above are about the lyrics repeated in every verse. Now let me tell you my opinion about the rest. ~\"Where they strung up a man. They say murdered three.\" So it\u0027s obvious the Capitol has killed a rebel. I can\u0027t but focus on \"they say\". The man probably hasn\u0027t done anything or at least anything against someone non-Capitol. He is accused of false things. The song indicates the rulers of Panem are killing innocent people. ~\"Where the dead man. Called out for his love to flee.\" Most people would say that the dead man tried to save his loved one, telling her to run away. I will go against this and say that he tried to save her, by telling her to join the rebellion. This is the only way for her (remember the loved one is actually everyone!) to be saved. If she run away she would simply survive, but if she fought she would LIVE!!! ~\"Where i told you to run. So we \u0027d both be free.\" It is just like the two lines i analyzed above, so please allow me to rest a little bit... ~\"Wear a necklace of rope. Side by side with me.\" The rebel invites everyone to join him in his war against the Capitol and to offer their lives just like him. I dont think the fact that the song accompanied the rebels in their greatest attack against the Capitol (during the first 3 movies), where so many people sacrificed their lives. This however could be countered by saying the lyrics were changed to \"necklace of HOPE\". Even though i read somewhere that the song is banned in Panem at least since Katniss was a little kid, so many people could know of its original lyrics. It has only been a week since i started watching the Hunger Games and i haven\u0027t read any of the books, so forgive me for any mistakes i have made and also for any grammar,syntax or spelling mistakes, since english is not my mother tongue. Thank you for your time and i hope for some answers to which i will happily response, Chris",
  "Chris Vazouras Since you\u0027ve only watched the movies, you can say that that\u0027s what the song is about, but you kind of missed the point. (I would have done the same if I have never read the books) So that song has existed before the rebellion. It is a song from district 12, and Katniss\u0027es father taught her it. As a kid, she never understood what the song was about, so she even made actual necklaces out of rope for her and Prim. But, when her mother saw that, she didn\u0027t allow them to sing that song anymore. She knew what it was about. It is when you love someone so much, that you don\u0027t want to see them get hurt anymore. You want them dead. Alongside with you. *SPOILERS* (Kind of) In the last book, the mockingjay, she wanted to kill Peta. Snow has hurt him, and she can\u0027t get over that. He doesn\u0027t know what is real, and what isn\u0027t, and he thinks Katniss is his biggest enemy and a liar. All his love for her is gone. ;( So, if you want to analize the song with that, here\u0027s what you get...  Are you, are you, coming to the tree. Are you comming to the place you last saw your loved one, are you comming to die with her (Katniss-to Peta) They strung up a man, they say who murdered three. Katniss feels dead. She is broken. She also thinks she\u0027s responsible for a lot of deaths that have happened. (Not going to spoil that for you) Strange thing did happen here, no stranger would it be. If we met, at midnight, in the Hanging Tree. Strange things are all the deaths, wars and tortures that have happened during the revolution, and she wants to, as I said, die, so it wouldn\u0027t be stranger with so many deaths that have already happened. Where the man called out, for his love to flee.  She wanted Peta to leave, before she could hurt him, befire anyone could hurt him. She wanted to leave him for good. But, as you know, he didn\u0027t. Where I told you too run, so we\u0027d both be free, She told both Peta and Gale to run away with her (remember the first scene of the movie, where Gale asks her to run away, she suggests the same, in the 2nd book) Gale, however says no, while Peta says yes, because yet again, he loves her so much he\u0027d risk his life for her (which he has done a couple of times). Wear a necklace of rope, side by side with me. At the end, Katniss is lost and broken, and hurt , and all she wants is to die, and she promises herself she would kill Peta first, to save him, for once.  Because she loves him And she feels in debt to him, that\u0027s why she always screamed she wants Peta to be safe. He saved her, and she wants to be even. But this time, because she trully loves him. Now, in the movie, they didn\u0027t make it so much of a love story, as they did make it a war and rebelion. So, from the movie point of view, you are correct. The only thing is that you forgot, the rebellion song had the lyrics Wear a necklace of hope, side by side with me.  So that the lyrics would match the rebellion.",
  "Thank you someone agrees. I don\u0027t like the version on the radio and I think of the people who haven\u0027t watched the movie and listen to it on the radio and they don\u0027t get the full meaning of the song.",

But I will say this: If Jennifer Lawrence WAS a singer and she was in the Jazz days I would be buying everything she made. Her voice, if she would push it into a singing voice, would be a rockin voice for Jazz haha. It\u0027s that natural rasp in her voice! :)   I heard she cried when she was supposed to learn how to \"sing\" this! Did she confirm that or is it just a rumor? If it\u0027s the truth, wow, she really did not want to do that, haha. Glad she did, though! Totally pulled it off.",

Also who gives a damn if she\u0027s good or not? It is your opinion just like my opinion on Taylor swift is she sucks. It\u0027s just an opinion. Too many people get all butt hurt over some loud mouths opinion. IT DOESN\u0027T MATTER SHE STILL HAS MORE MONEY THAN ANY OF US.",

People bitching about this song, how it is not music, how it should be banned, how it is cheap - the funny thing is, that even though she is not a singer, she (or them) made a better song, than most of the bullshit in the TOP charts nowadays worldwide. Maybe it\u0027s not funny, but sad.",

  "Love the song",
  "I actually find this version very unerving, because it\u0027s exactly the kind of thing that the Capitol would do-  Reduce the force of a lullaby to just a pop version, fit to be jammed out to. In reality? This song has a way deeper meaning than anyone sees. J-Law is a beautiful singer, no hate on her. She has a very natural voice, in fact. But this literally takes off the force from the whole effect that Suzanne Collins was originally trying to give. To (book) Katniss, this song was originally a rebellion, even at a young age because her father sang it against her mother\u0027s wish. So, this song is the perfect song to sing to Mockingjay, the very SYMBOL of rebellion.",
  "She is an good singer",
  "TBH Jennifer\u0027s natural voice is way better than many forced and trained voices nowadays. It kind of reminds me of blues since the musicians had natural and raspy voices since blues originate from slave music.  :) ",

  "I just realized... She\u0027s sung before. In Hunger Games, she sang to Prim when she had that nightmare. It was short, but she did it nonetheless. And she sang to Rue as she died. Why was Jennifer so apprehensive to sing if she\u0027s already done it before? ",

  "People!  Stop saying that she should be banned from the music industry!  First off, she\u0027s not IN the music industry, there\u0027s a REASON she\u0027s an actress, not a singer.  Second, Jennifer knows she isn\u0027t good enough a singer to possibly please critical people like you!  When she was told she had to sing for Mockingjay, she cried backstage because she didn\u0027t like the sound of her voice. But she did it anyway, and that takes a lot of courage. If you have a problem with courage, then I don\u0027t know what is up with you all.",

Sorry for my bed english im a german little boy.",
  "Well she didnt want children because she didnt want them to suffer the fright from the games and because they were victors their children would have a higher chance of being in the games because they make the games unfair like that.

  "For those of you who keep saying that this song is horrible based solely on the fact that you think Jennifer Lawrence can\u0027t sing are looking at this from the wrong perspective. This song isn\u0027t meant to impress people by her singing skills. The song is meant for the character in the movie, just like in the book. I highly doubt Lawrence said she wanted to sing a song for the soundtrack because she wants to start taking up a singing career. The fact that she sang the song is way more legit then having someone like Christina Aguilera sing the song for her. I think she did a fantastic job because you can hear the emotions in her voice as she sings. Which is to express what her character is feeling. So for her to be able to project those emotions in a song is awesome. Had the song been song with a perfect voice and belted out in different temples perfectly, the song wouldn\u0027t have the effect in the film that it has. As for the remix if you don\u0027t like it because you feel that she sucked as a singer then reread what I said above but if you don\u0027t like it because you think it was made by the Capitol then lol you guys are funny but if you didn\u0027t like it because you feel the meaning was lost, it\u0027s a movie guys and this isn\u0027t the first song from a movie to be turned into a remixed radio version.",

Or the pretty dolphins are put into marine parks such as seaworld and pretty much every park in japan. each captive dolphin is worth thousands and thats the mone that will continue the slaughter. Please dont buy tickets to marine parks the dolphins are starved and tortured to entertain you. if we can shut down marine parks we can shut down the slaughter. we need media exposure on this so we put so much pressure on japan they will have no other to stop.",

  "the dolphins are saved from slaughter in marine parks",
  "Stop eating fucking pigs, chickens, and cows than we\u0027ll talk.",
  "First off, the \"fact\" that dolphins are highly intelligent is false. It has been proven time and time again that they are no more intelligent than a dog. second, killing any animal for food is a part of nature, at least the dolphins have good lives out in the ocean free to do whatever they want and are not being farmed in cramped squalor conditions. sure they might be overfished or whatever, but there are many species out there that are getting the same treatment. so should we all just stop eating meat, or conscious beings? If that is the answer then we should also not eat plants or fungi because they both are known to consciously respond to a variety of things such as damage and illness. requests from other plants and fungi for nutrients etc... so we should just all starve ourselves and become extinct. seriously, while the dolphin harvesting practices should be closely monitored and all for overfishing, I am a believer that anyone should eat whatever they want.",

  "great song, but i don\u0027t like how they said necklace of hope instead of necklace of rope. I don\u0027t get it, first JLaw says she can\u0027t dance, but she was good in silver linings playbook. then JLaw says she can\u0027t sing, but she was good in this. Next she\u0027ll be saying she can\u0027t act, when clearly she can.",

  "Você,você vem para a arvore ,você,você vem para a arvore,n mas estranho seria se a gente se encontrar a meia noite na arvore forca",
  "What I don\u0027t like about Katniss is that she\u0027s really just a puppet. If it was up to her, she would have just protected Prim, not start a rebellion...the Girl on Fire and Mockingjay wasn\u0027t her idea. Protecting Prim was her first priority. I think that Prim dying in the revolution was a sign that none of this was Katniss\u0027s idea, and she\u0027d rather have stayed out of it",
  "Horrible song.. the lyrics are creepy.",

She may not be the greatest singer out there,  but she does have talent. And I mean if you were Katniss you wouldn\u0027t have the best voice either. I absolutely loved this part of the movie, her voice perfectly fit Katniss\u0027 character and made it very soulful sounding. Give her a break guys.. She tried her best (and it paid off)",

  "I love the Hunger Games. It puts a great perspective on reality, especially on humanity. I know a lot of people see it as just a book or movie, but I feel like the story has a lot more meaning than a lot of people know. I loved the whole thing. The story, the plot, the drama... But what I really loved was this song. I don\u0027t know why, but the whole part of, \u0027We took the capitol so lets teach them by putting the people from the capitol in another Hunger Games,\u0027 greatly amused me, and I hated/loved the end. I mean, there\u0027s no more insight on what happens to Gale or her mother, which I mean she didn\u0027t have much, more space, considering its all over. But the whole thing is just amazing, (although I hated the actor in the movies liked the books better)",

In the movie, Plutarch Heavensbee (played by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) asks Katniss to change the line from “wear a necklace of rope” to “wear a necklace of hope” to give the revolution a more uplifting message. Still, that necklace of hope is still intended to inspire people to fight (and likely die) for the revolution.\"",
  "The lyrics are kinda repetitive, but I love how the song slowly builds up. It builds a very dramatic feeling. And the instruments at 2:30.. Oh my goodness. I guess the song was meant to be a bit repetitive, so overall it\u0027s a very beautiful piece \u003c3  I haven\u0027t seen the movie yet, but I really want to.

Are you, are you Coming to the tree? Where dead man called out For his love to flee. Strange things did happen here No stranger would it be If we met at midnight In the hanging tree. Are you, are you Coming to the tree? Where I told you to run, So we\u0027d both be free. Strange things did happen here No stranger would it be If we met at midnight In the hanging tree. Are you, are you Coming to the tree? [Movie line:] Wear a necklace of rope, [Soundtrack line:] Wear a necklace of hope, Side by side with me.

  "This scene was so well done in the movie. The way the song transcended from being Katniss (Jen) singing alone to Pollux then to the people of Panem joining in with her as they were rebelling against their country\u0027s ruling body was so powerful to the audience. It really showed the effect that Katniss Everdeen, the Mockingjay, had on her people, and for someone like me, who has been a fan of the Hunger Games before there was an even talk of a movie, it was really satisfying and thrilling seeing this play out.",

  "Goshous No, it\u0027s not just you! I feel like some parts reference African lynchings. michiev Actually, yes, people have heard it somewhere else, it\u0027s called Billie Holiday\u0027s \"Strange Fruit\".",
  "BustedStatus The fuck? This song is about slavery in Panem which is the USA in the future. It\u0027s not that unreasonable to make connections to actual slavery in the past. ",
  "The song is not about slavery at all in the book it explains that it\u0027s about a place where people were hung for crimes and two people in love couldn\u0027t be together so they hung themselves there. No references to slavery.",
  "***** Have you read the books or seen the films? The Capitol enslaves people in the districts and forces them to work for no money. That\u0027s the definition of slavery. It\u0027s why they\u0027re talking about freedom in the song and the dead man in the song is calling for his lover to join him in death since a life without freedom isn\u0027t worth living.",
  "Mie R I HAVE read the books and I\u0027m talking about the meaning of the song.",
  "***** Pretty close except there was a detail saying the tree was used for hanging criminals and two lovers hung themselves there.",
  "*****  I don\u0027t know much about american slavery since I\u0027m canadian.",
  "I wouldn\u0027t say it\u0027s a direct reference, but I think the whole series of books and movies is similar to any form of oppression that eventually leads to rebellion and revolution. I would say the similarity in themes is there. This need for secret meetings to discuss an eventual uprising, and using song as a way of getting messages across to others without being discovered. It\u0027s a common theme in a lot of songs that came out during the time of American slavery and the civil rights movement. It\u0027s not so much reflecting american slavery in specific but oppression in general. I would not be surprised if they referenced older songs that were created in such times to write this song.",
  "I can totally imagine this being an African spiritual",
  "Definitely. I\u0027m reading these comments, of course it\u0027s not directly about American slavery/post slavery but where do you think artists (including authors and storytellers) get influenced from, life and history. Also, the song is very native or indigenous itself resembling the style of music a tribe or an underrepresented people being oppressed has in the passed (i think a lot of Native American). And African people are known for creating songs to communicate and get through situations, especially with code switching. There is plenty of \"inspiration\" from American slavery. ",
  "Goshous It references American slavery if you want it to, but if you read the lyrics, there are only 2 individual lines per stanza *  They strung up a man, they say who murdered three *  Where the dead man called out for his love to be free *  Where I told you to run, so we\u0027d both be free *  Wear a necklace of hope (movie says this word was changed from \"rope\"), side by side with me You could just as easily say it references the Old West, you could even stretch it to the Holocaust. I think the truest reference is the suffering of people who would fight and die for another.",
  "It\u0027s actually about two lovers that were having an affair and couldn\u0027t be together.",
  "I mean you\u0027re all right, no one said it solely referenced slavery, it can reference a lot of things. But to answer to the original question, no it\u0027 not just you.",
  "Slavery? No. Racism and oppression in the 1800\u0027s? Yes.",
  "It sounds like black musick, i thought it too, you\u0027re right",
  "Yes , It does it\u0027s an spin off of Billy Holiday- Strange Fruit",
  "BustedStatus Racist imbecile. ",
  "***** What crimes??? Blacks had no rights back then. Blacks were lynched for the stupidest things. ",
  "First off, that wasn\u0027t in the book so why would it be in the movie. Second of all, Wikipedia is an unreliable site for factual information. And lastly, why did you feel the need to put said information in a comment chain about the origin and meaning of a song?",

  "The hanging tree is a symbol of oppression.  It\u0027s about the tyranny of the minority (the nobility) versus freedom/nationalism (the commoner)..  For many centuries, the name Tyburn (or hanging tree) was synonymous with capital punishment, it having been the principal place for execution of London criminals and convicted traitors, including many religious and political martyrs.The first recorded execution took place at a site next to the stream in 1196. William Fitz Osbert, the populist leader of the poor of London, was cornered in the church of St Mary le Bow. He was dragged naked behind a horse to Tyburn, where he was hanged. In 1537, Henry VIII used Tyburn to execute the ringleaders of the Pilgrimage of Grace, including Sir Nicholas Tempest, one of the northern leaders of the Pilgrimage and the King\u0027s own Bowbearer of the Forest of Bowland. His daughter Queen Mary burned her opponents at Tyburn.  Later Tyburn was eulogized as a place of martyrs and freedom riders and thus moved to NewGate by the Hanovers, who kept their executions secret.  Ida Wells used the aspect of the hanging tree in her famous essays on lynching of men/women of color.  To narrow the scope of the hanging tree to just American slavery is an injustice to men and women all over the world who have fought against tyranny.  Today, injustice plagues women in the Middle East; young men/women who struggle to secure a livelihood; and a host of tyranny be it political or religious (like ISIS).     ",
  "Kiandre Cooley no, it doesnt.the song is in the book about a man that got framed for killing people and wants his lover to kill herself too so that they can be together. Stop making everything about race ffa",
  "I\u0027m gonna go ahead and guess you haven\u0027t read the book.",
  "Social Media Terrorist Correct!  passage is \"We didn\u0027t sing it anymore, my father and I, or even speak of it. After he died, it used to come back to me a lot. Being older, I began to understand the lyrics. At the beginning, it sounds like a guy is trying to get his girlfriend to secretly meet up with him at midnight. But it\u0027s an odd place for a tryst, a hanging tree, where a man was hung for murder. The murderer\u0027s lover must have had something to do with the killing, or maybe they were just going to punish her anyway, because his corpse called out for her to flee. That\u0027s weird obviously, the talking-corpse bit, but it\u0027s not until the third verse that \"The Hanging Tree\" begins to get unnerving. You realize the singer of the song is the dead murderer. He\u0027s still in the hanging tree. And even though he told his lover to flee, he keeps asking if she\u0027s coming to meet him. The phrase \"Where I told you to run, so we\u0027d both be free\" is the most troubling because at first you think he\u0027s talking about when he told her to flee, presumably to safety. But then you wonder if he meant for her to run to him. To death. In the final stanza, it\u0027s clear that that\u0027s what he\u0027s waiting for. His lover, with her rope necklace, hanging dead next to him in the tree.",
  "Social Media Terrorist Liberals are making it fit to Billy Holidays\u0027 Strange Fruit - but this is nonsense.  Ida Wells referenced her texts on Tyburn. Period.  The song Strange Fruit by Holiday was also a take on Tyburn and the Carte Blanche that the French Monarchs used to imprison or hang prisoners without benefit of trial (French Revolution).  The people hung at Tyburn were called \u0027strange fruit\".  Daniel Boone, when he lived and acted as judge in Missouri held court in the front of his house which boasted a large hanging tree.  He referred to the tree \"offering fruit\" to justice.  ",
  "Yes it does omg just noticed",

  "When the people starting singing, it\u0027s actually kind of haunting. All the death in the movie, really scary and sad. Its a beautiful song, but it also represents death.",
  "The symbolism behind this song is extremely dark. Its about a man (likely African American) being framed for three murders and lynched. Those were some dark times",
  "Upon listening to this song again, it made me realize something else. The man who was hung, is asking if his lover was also hung along with him, even though he told her to run away. \"Are you, are you, coming to the tree. I told you to run so we\u0027d both be free...\"  ...Strange things did happen, no stranger would it be, if we met at midnight in the hanging tree...wear a necklace of rope, side by side with me (they changed it to hope in this version)",
  "Pepper Stark it\u0027s a song now since it was .... well sung",
  "Lol there\u0027s a pretty long explanation in the book, and you\u0027re pretty close -- it\u0027s about a man hung for murder, and he wants his lover, with her rope necklace, hanging dead next to him in the tree, and with the idea that the place he was leaving her was really worse than death.",
  "Pepper Stark Incorrect actually. The song Collins wrote was adapted from the song Strange Fruit by Billie Holiday, which was adapted from a poem by Abel Meeropol. Strange Fruit became the Civil Rights\u0027 movements in the 50s \u0026 60s. I am incredibly surprised that this song hasn\u0027t received more negative reviews or public outcries considering the history behind the song. Considering society\u0027s need to be politically correct about everything all the time now, i was expecting this to be flamed pretty hard, online at least.",
  "In the books when she sings it she realizes how dark her childhood was learning such songs.",
  "HikariAijuntani Why would it be?  The whole story of the Hunger Games is a social commentary and a critical examination of a society where solders are sent off to foreign wars and we watch reality tv and revel in the difficulties of others.  The song is about preferring death to life in bondage.  It is absolutely perfect for the movie (and more importantly), the book. The Hunger Games are not just another \"YA\" book series.  They transcend age groups because there\u0027s a whole nother level to them.  ",
  "Alissa Barrie Yeeeaaahh, but I was talking specifically about the history behind this song and society\u0027s reaction to it considering the implications of the song. Not the books. The books are amazing honestly, nothing bad to say about the books. Nothing bad to really say about the song either, just honest surprise. ",
  "HikariAijuntani only bad thing is its basically Battle Royale. ",
  "Why African American?",
  "***** this \u0027song\u0027 is a poem-song with every word taken directly out of the books.",
  "***** because the fact is that it was more likely to be an African American.",
  "Technically this isn\u0027t the same song,so the race isn\u0027t really specified in this even if it is adapted from that other song where it does",
  "You think it may be African American only because of how in our past the majority of slaves were African American. In the story however, all lower class citizens were slaves. The song could have been written about any one that\u0027s why it was so powerful for the rebellion. A governing body doesn\u0027t have to discriminate against any single people group to have slavery.",
  "Joshua Gleason  Actually this is about a black man got the song from strange fruit",
  "remember that the hunger ames take pace way way in the future so i don\u0027t think they even know about slavery and all that stuff.",
  "Nati Marenco actually there\u0027s a theory that the hunger games world took place when america was divided into 13 colonies.",
  "sanayapie art if your talking about early america 13 colonies, that is waaaayy ridiculously off. There is so much proof against that therory",
  "Aye u think it\u0027s a little worse than that I mean have you listened to the lyrics closely? It says ,\"If we met at midnight IN the hanging tree\" it\u0027s saying we\u0027re gonna kill ourselves another example oh this is when she talks about wearing the neckless with her friends.its talking about wearing a noose, so yeah this song is kinda depressing and shouldn\u0027t be played on the radio",
  "Doki Doki because blacks were lynched or hung from trees in the pre civil rights movement, a lot of times just for being black. this song was originally by a black women singing about what happened to blacks prior to the 60s.",
  "morgan williams k!ññox 😰😰😰😢😩 😨!??/s dfahdmtt??vupbj, !",
  "currica Sanchez what",
  "This song does remind me of Strange Fruit by Billie Holiday",
  "Joëlle Weetjewel Hahaha its just foolish to think racism will ever end. I\u0027ve dealt with a fair share of it, and I seriously doubt it ever will.",
  "I am taking an African American History class and I was born and raised in Mississippi. For those of you defending this song I recommend you taking some time to research the history of the lynchings of African Americans it is as simple as searching for \"lynchings in the south\" here on youtube. Do a Google search \"strange fruit hunger games\" and the first couple of links will discuss the similarities. I am not here to argue or make suggestions for anyone who has commented or will comment. I am here encouraging social education amongst all viewers. By the way here are the lyrics by Billie Holiday: Southern trees bear strange fruit Blood on the leaves and blood at the root Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees Pastoral scene of the gallant south The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh Then the sudden smell of burning flesh Here is fruit for the crows to pluck For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop Here is a strange and bitter crop",
  "Actually..In my opinion I believe that this song has nothing to do with the symbolism are you talking about.Sure it may have been inspired by the \"Strange Fruit\", but this is the Hunger Games universe..this is Panem. It mentions that this song was forbidden from even singing it..so it might was a symbolism for the past rebelion and uprising. I believe that in the first verse it talks about someone or people in general that were accused or went against peace keepers.Also it might want to show the executions that were happening at the time. Moreover, I don\u0027t remember the verses in order, I believe in general that it talks about the \"monarchy\" they were under and wanted to state that people should sacrifice themeselves and fight for their revolution.Furthermore don\u0027t forget that Katniss\u0027 father was teaching her sister and her that song...when she was very young and didn\u0027t even know what the lyrics ment, and she mistaken them too.Finally their mother got mad on their father because he teached them that song...so she was probably trying to protect her family. Sorry If I am not understanable...english is not my first language and I try as hard as I can to type correctly. Do not forget this is my opion and I did not want to offend anyone. :)",
  "Nick Tsanakos I wanted to add that when it say to come with a neclasse of hope/rope..it means as I said above to sacrifise themeselves...",
  "I don\u0027t even wanna read these (most likely) ignorant comments. I get where you got that idea, I thought of that too, but I don\u0027t think that was the intention of the song. It just happens to fit the situation of the 1900\u0027s",
  "dat_1_kid if i\u0027m not mistaken the first dude we see the capital put down in the film series is an old black guy i\u0027d be shocked if that kind of subtext wasn\u0027t intentional",

  "Nie podoba mi się ten film ale piosenka jest świetna 👍💞",
  "They changed the lyrics slightly to those in the book. In the fourth verse, Katniss sings \"wear a necklace of HOPE side by side with me\", in the book however, it\u0027s written as \"wear a necklace of ROPE side by side with me\". The book even explains the meaning behind the lyrics: \"... We didn\u0027t sing it anymore, my father and I, or even speak of it. After he died, it used to come back to me a lot. Being older, I began to understand the lyrics. At the beginning, it sounds like a guy is trying to get his girlfriend to secretly meet up with him at midnight. But it\u0027s an odd place for a tryst, a hanging tree, where a man was hung for murder. The murderer\u0027s lover must have had something to do with the killing, or maybe they were just going to punish her anyway, because his corpse called out for her to flee. That\u0027s weird obviously, the talking-corpse bit, but it\u0027s not until the third verse that \"The Hanging Tree\" begins to get unnerving. You realize the singer of the song is the dead murderer. He\u0027s still in the hanging tree. And even though he told his lover to flee, he keeps asking if she\u0027s coming to meet him. The phrase \"Where I told you to run, so we\u0027d both be free\" is the most troubling because at first you think he\u0027s talking about when he told her to flee, presumably to safety. But then you wonder if he meant for her to run to him. To death. In the final stanza, it\u0027s clear that that\u0027s what he\u0027s waiting for. His lover, with her rope necklace, hanging dead next to him in the tree. ...I used to think the murderer was the creepiest guy imaginable. Now, with a couple of trips to the Hunger Games under my belt, I decide not to judge him without knowing more details. Maybe his lover was already sentenced to death and he was trying to make it easier. To let her know he\u0027d be waiting. Or maybe he thought the place he was leaving her was really worse than death...\"",

  "i love this so much",
  "I an very offended hy this song and will boycott the station that plays it",
  "Don\u0027t ignore the fact that Katniss was originally written as a person of color with \"black hair and olive skin\". Yet they cast a white girl to play her and then had her sing a song about lynching. This is an example of white washing. So wrong!! Black lives matter.",
  "Lol. In my opinio the best actors are black. Morgan Freeman, Will Smith for example. This isn\u0027t a racism thing. Its just that the one who fits the film best, gets to act in it. In 50shades of grey they describe a tough man with copper/brown hair. They have chosen for someone with a \"little boys face\" Jezzz people need to stop thinking that everything is racist",
  "It states no where in the book that Katniss is \"a woman of colour\" as you have put it. It states olive, which, although can refer to black people, more typically refers to people of Mediterranean decent. Also, race does not play a major role in the series, it isn\u0027t based on races, it is based on classes. So please pull your head out of your ass and enjoy the music.",
  "Classism has strong ties to racism, though. You can\u0027t have a discussion about poor vs. rich without acknowledging white privilege. I\u0027m simply saying \"hey maybe it could be cool if women of color had some well deserved representation in film\". The casting directors specifically asked for Caucasian females between 15 and 20. They didn\u0027t even try. ",
  "Also, I\u0027ll just leave this link here. When fans threw a tantrum about Rue\u0027s character being cast as a black girl. It\u0027s systematic racism. Sorry that I can\u0027t just \"enjoy the music\" ",

  "The first time I heard it and that scene, speechless... feel bad for anyone listening this right now before watching the movie, you wont get the same feeling...",
  "When I first heard the Hanging Tree, I almost cried and my heart burst. The Hanging Tree signifies Katniss and Peeta\u0027s relationship and it also signifies hope in the darkness when the people of Panem rebel against the Capitol and President Snow. There\u0027s much more to the song. I think the song represents Christ hanging on a cross to die; and to redeem us from sin and darkness. When she says \"Are you coming to the tree?\", she is guiding us to the tree (the cross) (in Panem\u0027s case, the Hanging Tree and what Peeta had went through during his captivity in the Capitol.), someone who had died is calling her to the tree \"Where I told you to run so we\u0027d both be free\"; signifies Christ\u0027s dying and resurrection from the dead",

Also, Jennifer Lawrence never tried to make it in the music industry. She\u0027s singing a song that was written in the book.

  "Exactly lol and this is one song. Maybe she was asked to sing it this way lol, in house at the end of the street she sung and was good lol. People are just idiots!",
  "True, and besides, this doesn\u0027t sound auto tune at all. Sure, we can\u0027t hear her real voice through a screen and speakers, but she is not bad at singing. Maybe this style of music doesn\u0027t fit her but she is an actress, not a singer. I think she said she isn\u0027t a good singer during an interview.",
  "Kaytlyn Fan She did say that in an interview. Like nowadays no matter who you are, when you become famous people still find ways to hate you and it\u0027s very annoying.",

  "Since she is an actress she doesn\u0027t have to be a singer as well.",

  "Yung Caliph The movie is based on a book.  The character Katniss from the book sings.  In the book Katniss was an OK amateur singer, people liked to listen when she sang, but she was definitely not a trained professional - she wouldn\u0027t have been able to afford it - and she didn\u0027t practice often (I don\u0027t remember for sure but I think she stopped singing after her father died because her dad had loved to sing and singing brought back painful memories).  I guess they thought it would be better if Jennifer Lawrence herself sang rather than have her lipsync as someone else sings so that the voice sounds like Katniss\u0027s voice.",

  "She is a good singer though ❤️",
  "I\u0027m pretty sure the controversy about why the song should be banned might have it\u0027s roots in African American history...   Not positive, but my daughter started singing this before I\u0027d heard it and that\u0027s where my mind went right away.   I can imagine, if people are unfamiliar with the story Hunger Games that it would bring up some unpleasant associations and possibly trigger some level of outrage.    But, I might be wrong too. It could be as simple and vapid as people not liking her voice. I don\u0027t know. :-)",
  "Tara Denny the book says its about a dead murderer singing to his love for her to come to him and hang herself so she can be with him...",
  "This entire arguement is very uncomfortable. She\u0027s not a singer so don\u0027t hate her for being a bad singer. She. Doesn\u0027t. Sing. She\u0027s an ACTRESS.",
  "Yes, I agree with you. Besides, she is not even a bad singer. In my own opinion, I like her type of voice, low and a tiny bit of rasp. She can sing...better than a lot of other people.",
  "Not only that but most popular \"singers\" can\u0027t actually sing anyway. Maybe 1/10 of them can.",
  "Obviously if she sings a song, she\u0027s a singer. If you sing a song you\u0027re not an actress at that time, you\u0027re a SINGER.",
  "coolcoke4353 did she sign a record label to be singer? No she didn\u0027t. Basically you\u0027re making it easier. She acts in movies. So she\u0027s an actress. But please no more arguing. She\u0027s an actress, she even said that she hates singing.",
  "Alexis Garcia Then why is the singing exactly?",
  "Ikr if you sing a song it does not make you a singer lol",
  "I, personally think that she is fabulous for this song, and if anyone remembers the scene from the book where she sings this then she gets the tone perfectly. And as for the sing/actress thing. She is an actress in a movie that songs a song. Its like a cats brain in a dogs body, its neither, its both. ",

  "still think shes a really good singer tbh, and actress, my favourite - my opinion-",
  "I personally love her voice. I think it makes the song more powerful. :)",
  "I just watched it. I can attest to her vocal talents. She sounded perfectly human and imperfect. It was wonderful hearing how good her tone sounded.",
  "***** Yeah ... I see your point. It\u0027s impossible to please everyone, I guess. ",
  "xactly this is for the movie it\u0027s not like she\u0027s gonna become a singer now",
  "Martha Gerdes You deaf? There is no auto-tune being used here. ",

  "ApartmentViews I guess you should go to a doctor... The autotune is horrible..",
  "same. i think she did very well. shes not a singer, she shouldnt sound like demi lovato or something. i love the song and i think she did amazing.",
  "CAPITALIZE YOUR I\u0027S AND S!! omg I\u0027m turning into my teacher O.O",
  "She should be banned from society in general. I\u0027m not saying I wish ill on her, but If she  was to fall in into a giant blender some day, I don\u0027t think I\u0027d flinch. Which is good really, means I don\u0027t really dislike her that much... If the same thing happened to One Direction I think I\u0027d make a party :)",
  "Too me i really like the song and Jennifer Lawrence sings it well. Favorite moment from the movie to me.",
  "miloradvlaovic 😂😂😂😂😂 that was funny",
  "David Ortega Now THAT was really funny!",
  "I don\u0027t think you all realise that Jennifer Lawrence isn\u0027t trying to be a singer. Katniss herself is no professional singer- she simply sings and it\u0027s simple and charming, just like Lawrence.",
  "Exactly!! Jennifer Lawrence even said she couldn\u0027t sing, so obviously she\u0027s not trying to be something she isnt",
  "Lexi Ober The thing is she doesn\u0027t sound bad at all either. ",
  "The thing is, this girl is an actress and said she hates singing even though she has a better voice than some of the singers today.",
  "She sang surprisingly well.",
  "Autotune guys.... Are you that deaf?",
  "TheDoooden I for one hear absolutely no auto tune.  And I have actually used the program in music production... and far from deaf.",
  "If she had sang in perfect pitch, it would have seem fake. ",
  "Exactly",
  "People need to say lay off her and say that about Drake... Wheel chair boy actor and got into the music industry. ",
  "ELLiE SAYSS and the unnecessary hating continues",
  "Can\u0027t be hating when I actually listen to Drake\u0027s music.... I was making a point to those who want to bring up actors/actress should stay out the music industry.  Check yourself.",
  "This song was written purely for the very powerful use in the film, it\u0027s to give the other districts hope and shows they have a leader and should stand up to the capitol... People who are saying she is a bad singer may aswell be from the capitol (inconsiderate pricks)",
  "I also don\u0027t get it. She has a pretty good voice for an actress. \u003c3",

  "Alexis Garcia i love her voice",

  "I thought she sang it great :/",
  "Alexis Garcia the imperfections of her voice not being vocally trained makes it so much better than as if someone with experience in playing the vocal chords sang this",

  "The song was just to promote the movie. It’s not like she was trying to be a pop singer. Whoever said that is clearly an idiot.",
  "@@kaytlynfan4403 bet she could be both",
  "She\u0027s not an actress, she\u0027s an actor",
  "Work is work. Hate is hate. Love is love. Don\u0027t be the fool to question it. This is why she excels.",
  "This is a song for the districts not the capitol, let the judgy capitol folk complain, they don\u0027t feel the subtext of this song",
  "Miley can do it all.",
  "She didn’t even sing that bad! And she had to sing for a movie, it wasn’t just for fun",
  "The girl in the movie is not the original artist of this song",
  "She a damn good singer it shouldn\u0027t matter what she is is singing for hope",
  "Exactly",
  "WAIT PPL THINK SHE DID BAD",
  "I lit came her cuz i think she did it amazing",
  "I\u0027ve heard her voice in a random video on Instagram and I have stopped paying attention to the video to listen to her. Love it.",
  "No one will ever know how intelligent your statement is. I\u0027m thankful for life because of ppl like you. Stay conscious pls and ty!",
  "And 8years later I\u0027m coming back to listen",
  "No- no one should be ‘banned or canceled’ because of your opinion, who are you? What have you ever accomplished? It takes NOTHING to be a critic…",
  "For real, like the point of the song isn\u0027t to sound good anyway, it\u0027s a song of rebellion",
  "This is what called \"a movie song\" It\u0027s not a pop song or whatever. Movie songs are there to put your emotions in and sing in an emotion. You can hear this in her voice. And exactly she is a f#!$ing good actress. And to be honest Jennifer Lawrence her voice is so raw it would sound so cool for a rock song. But anyway i know people who sound bad even WITH autotune so uhm this is angelical singing right here!",
  "Dude what are they even complaining about she sounds just fine leave her alone",
  "This song was FIE and fit the type of world the movie is in",
  "People like judging while they can\u0027t do shit 😒",
  "I agree",
  "People are stupid asf her voice may not be as pleasant as Taylor swift but she portrayed damn well the emotion required for this scene",
  "Better than I sound",
  "She\u0027s definitely a singer, this is beautiful",
  "Enjoy ❤ it while you can",
  "Bro I agree in sooo many ways I love the books so it makes me upset that people are like that 😅",
  "А мне бы хотелось, чтобы этот запоминающийся голос исполнял песни с оптимистическим содержанием, вселяющим веру в доброе и вечное.❤",
  "i personally like the calmness of her voice. it’s very peaceful but it’s powerful at the same time",
  "She\u0027s not a bad singer either.",
  "I always thought she sounded good. I love her singing. It\u0027s not fake",
  "Just leave her alone she is and stop being jealous.",
  "Потрясающая вещь!Великолепно звучит! Плевать что говорят!",
  "Well she may not have the gimmicky over the top vibrato or whatever that showoffs do for the national anthem, but she is by no means a BAD singer.  She carries the tune.  And yeah, it\u0027s supposed to be a normal person being somber.",
  "This song is catchy have yall heard Gucci gang... how does an actress beat actual award winning music. Jennifer Lawrence is a national treasure. Her hot ones episode says it all",
  "Opinions are like hemorrhoids...every asshole has one",
  "Coz of pictures. Took it as window screen during my exterior operation. It helps.",
  "She is a better singer than most moder “good” singers",
  "Wtf wrong with her singing? Anyone hating how many views does your song have... so obviously an actress who ain\u0027t a singer still doing it better then yall... for her not being a singer she has a good voice with the potential to be great if she wanted to pursue that...",
  "I find her really good at singing too",
  "what ? I can\u0027t believe people say that because every time I hear this song I get goosebumps because it\u0027s so good",
  "Who said that",
  "No one should be banned from anything everyone has a chance to do anything they want",
  "It’s cuz it comes about turning on the government",
  "Some people Always have their damn mouth Open",
  "If I’m honest she’s better than most singers now 😅",
  "It has nothing to do with her music or acting she\u0027s an incredible actor. It\u0027s the fact she was grandfathered into ole eppy\u0027s crime ring. I do still feel sorry for her though she never had a chance in Hollywood. especially being a child icon. The pedos in power saw her and her influence and forced her to use said influence to gather children to a multitude of pedo islands. Epsteins isn\u0027t the only one folks. But that being said they shouldnt ban the movies or the music but do more work to fix the hollywood pedo problem. Scapegoating these peoples music and films won\u0027t fix the issue. We need to stop these rich pedos from pulling the strings and turning many of our fav content creators into pedos themselves 💯",
  "I like her voice",
  "Her voice ain’t bad. Certainly fits the tone of the song",
  "They’re mad because she isn’t using auto tune and is actually just singing naturally",
  "Her less than perfect, stress filled voice, gave such a real and perfect tone to this song and moment in the film.",
  "No in my opinion not only is shr an actress but actually she sang this song just right like its not that bad they were just hating.. the emotions are only right but those people who hate clearly dont have anything to do with their life.",
  "​@@alexandracollinssshe sang, she cried, but the song and voice touched our hearts",
  "I don’t know a single person that has said that.",
  "a parte ma poi letteralmente doveva cantare così ahahaha, non è mica una canzone di gioia",
  "It\u0027s not about singer. It\u0027s about revolution.",
  "Schöne Stimme ❤❤❤❤",
  "It sounds perfectly in character for someone who was taken from their family and forced to kill innocent children for entertainment. Shes been through a lot by this point in the story, and the mental toll its taken on her is portrayed perfectly here.",
  "I like it, it’s eerily haunting",
  "Descubrí agora, e achei maravilhosa essa voz... não é profissional! Gostaria de ouvir no final da noite e compartilhando o mesmo  travesseiro... ❤❤❤❤❤",
  "❤❤❤❤",
  "Gaga can sing. If anyone should be banned from music, it\u0027s the filthy, female rappers who sexyalize young girls by promoting fornication and immorality.",
  "Yeah now people hate Lucy , someone who can sing and really sang in the movie 😅😂",
  "She has a beautiful voice. Cant stand her politics but love her voice her acting and she is hilarious",
  "I think she did a wonderful job singing",
  "I have never ever seen anyone say she should be banned from the music industry",
  "Yeah, also it wasn’t her job to sing it’s not part of her character. She wasn’t  supposed to sound good",
  "I think the fact that she is not a professional just add that bit of realism to it If we were to In the actual hunger games universe then she wouldn\u0027t be an amazing singer and I think the fact Actual singing without Background music makes that much more powerful",
  "People so stupid to know that we need a song for the revolution not for concert 😊",
  "This song hits different this year",
  "Great song and love her voice!!! Sultry and REAL!!!",
  "Who tf said tht",
  "Either way she sounds so good so I don’t know what people are talking about",
  "Yeah, and she\u0027s still better than most of the \"singers\" out there",
  "She sounds just fine",
  "She\u0027s a human character who sings to her sister, not a professional singer who is trying to sing for the Capital, her singing is clearly circumstancial, how many of us would sing this good circumstantially?",
  "She woke😮",
  "Actually, I think her singing is lovely, really.",
  "Yas",
  "And even if she was, this is supposed to be a anthem not a song. Isn\u0027t about being pretty and well singed.",
  "I think this is simply bc of sexists",
  "They aren’t music fans",
  "People have to realize that she’s not a trained singer.  She’s trained to be an actress.  But she’s good in this song.  It sounds so real and it makes me want to finish the series (not that I didn’t want to before)",
  "But she’s still a good singer",
  "The line was originally necklace of rope",
  "She did an amazing job at singing! I\u0027m here trying to find the song because I thought it was great!",
  "I think she has a good voice",
  "I think even if they got somebody like Ariana Grande to sing this song, it wouldn\u0027t be as good as the way Jennifer Lawrence did it. She may not be a singer but she did an excellent job",
  "Está es la mejor canción de un película de acción",
  "They don’t actually think she’s a horrible singer. They just wish they could sing like her ☺️",
  "This song really bring peace to me first time listening 🎶 to this masterpiece ❤ and I feel so good in peace and comfortable 😌 thanks to the artist may GOD bless you 🙏🏾 and inspire you more and more you did a great job",
  "Agreed i like her version a lot better than the new hunger games one i love the raspiness to her voice",
  "So.  Shut.   Up.    You.    Pick. Me.  No.  One.  Ask.  You.  Did.   God.  Or.    Your.    Techer. Or.   Your.   Mum.  Or.   Dad. Or.   Jesus",

  "Ya but she is also a good singer",
  "@@dASDFGismI am Spanish.. what do you mean.. que dices? No entiendo, que hubo de malo !!?",
  "Ya good, but also, I think she should join the music industry",
  "This song is raw and a an unrefined voice is perfect for it. This happens alot with song writers. Prince is a prime example! He wrote so many great hits and not all were made for his voice. Jennifer Lawrence did the best version for this scene and movie. Katniss is raw, unrefined, and wild. And Jennifer delivered. 👏👏👏👏👏",
  "Nor is it supposed to be good. She\u0027s singing it after bombing after battles after The Games and war. It shouldn\u0027t be pretty it should be ugly, hurt, true.",
  "This song is good. It\u0027s most about the violins. Also her singing voice is very comforting.",
  "​@@kieramcgregorI thing she is a good singer. The song is good too. Not everyone knows greatness when they hear it.",
  "​@@kaytlynfan4403she sings well. She is hot too. I wish she would sing to me.",
  "​@@s4ls4l18singing it softly with my song",
  "It\u0027s simple. A voice doesn\u0027t have to be professionaly trained to be beautiful. There are a lot of imperfect singers out there with beautiful voices",
  "I don’t get how they made a club mix of this.",
  "@@WickedQueenAvice they made club mix of Motzart too. Practically everything. Some guy falling off akateboard.",
  "Exactly",
  "Because people are always bitching about someone they admire",
  "@@theburningman5047 it\u0027s more about the God like violins and voice synthesizer than her intro singing.",
  "@@theburningman5047 the violin sounds like it\u0027s  played by Lucifer himself.",
  "For me I think this song is so good",
  "@@iamjann.c it was written by an expert. Listen to the violin.",
  "Yeah good tune for Gaza and the westbank fight on for survival",
  "No one said that, dramatic much?",
  "Honestly I love her voice",
  "Logan Paul sings I love her sing so fuck em",
  "Also if shes supposed to be singing in character.. Katniss is not supposed to sound like some gentle songstress either lol",
  "This comment is 9 years old, I came here to say nothing more than that and that yes she is a great actress and singer lol. Wild how time flies",
  "Honestly it sounds pretty good to me.",
  "Very powerful song... doesn\u0027t matter who songs it. The meaning says everything...",
  "@@alexandracollinss It’s understandable why she would",
  "Good voice, just untrained!",
  "I like this better than any Taylor swift song!!",
  "It ain’t bad tho",
  "She sings better than Heidi... 😵‍💫",
  "You need to remember she’s singing from a POV of an average person, not a singer, besides I think the song is great",
  "I thought it was dope! 😂😂",
  "The fuck why​@@alexandracollinss",
  "Idk, I like it.",
  "Though...she actually sings it damn well",
  "Actually it\u0027s crazy coz I\u0027ve come here coz i heard a snippet and i thought this was awesome singing",
  "Because if this the only song she sang, it would make it so much more special",
  "I actually don\u0027t mind her singing 😅😂",
  "Don’t listen to Nico then for them, she became an icon doing this sort of songs",
  "I think she did a great job as a matter of fact I came here just to listen to her again and admittedly again !!",
  "Right, her voice is fine and it\u0027s her voice which made more sense in the film!! She\u0027s great in every way!",
  "No, these days you have to be a singer, actress, dancer, director, producer, etc.",
  "Wdym, 1:50 Is my fav",
  "Jealous",
  "This is a great song, who said she was a bad singer?",
  "I was surprised and  loved it that the actress did the song herself, most appropriate,  Well done Jennifer, you nailed it !!! ❤❤❤",
  "I think she did pretty good on this song",
  "She sounds beautiful either way don\u0027t care if u able to or willing to sing go for it. Go for it ❤",
  "Yeah but she\u0027s also singing greatly tf",
  "Also, she actually sounds pretty good",
  "Tbh, I think she sang it beautifully, because it\u0027s got a nice Southern Gospel feel. ❤",
  "​@@Lexig76This is why, at 16yo, I made the decision to beat to my own drum. Cuz no Matt what I do -- someone, somewhere, is gonna find fault. So I might as well be happy being \u0027me\u0027.",

  "@@bertbaker7067 This is very true",
  "Horrible singer??????? Her voice was born for this song",
  "😊😊😊😊",
  "I think she did a phenomenal job! I had to hunt down this song after watching the movie that’s how much it moved me!!!. I think it was incredibly placed in the right scene at the right time and her version and execution of it is perfection.",
  "She’s a good singer",
  "9 yrs later and this song is trending in shorts and reels",
  "People are pathetic oh my god",
  "People don’t understand the point, she’s not supposed to be a singer, she’s supposed to be an average person, the point isn’t the song it’s the fact it brings the people together",
  "Plus, her character just went through a traumatic experience. I would expect someone to try and sing beautifully with so much on her mind",
  "Bro this shit sounds amazing vocally what even",
  "what?? her voice is absolutely gorgeous here!!!",
  "I think she sounds perfectly fine. Jennifer Lawrence said she was terried of singing because she isn\u0027t a singer. But there\u0027s a natural rawness about her voice that makes the song sound natural.",
  "@@curiousgamer5509 Indeed.  Also, I can imagine Hunger Games is gonna get more attention due to Donald Sutherland passing away today.",
  "still she shiiit",
  "Jealousy, and keyboard warriors, the internet is full of both, cowards and pathetic losers",
  "People are stupid 😊",
  "I don\u0027t think the idiots understand. It wouldn\u0027t of worked/had the same impact sang perfectly and in perfect key and pitch. It\u0027s the whole point to the feel of the song. Jen is a superstar and amazing at all she does and remains humble ✨️",
  "Auto tune is an industry standard for over 45yrs. People confuse auto tune with a type of auto tune filter known as tech . She is auto tuned tho it\u0027s all tuned hence how it has advanced channels and vocal points i​@@kaytlynfan4403",
  "I\u0027ve felt as i actully   like this",
  "Exactly and this isn’t even horrible singing either, I like listening to this!",

  "Wdym she’s a good singer too!!!",
  "Her voice is pretty. Dame haunting all I\u0027m going to say 😢",
  "@@kieramcgregor why does she have to be asked to sing this way? there\u0027s nothing wrong with how she sang.",
  "who the hell is saying that",
  "She also isn’t a bad singer",
  "In my opinion, she nailed it! She captured the emotions perfectly",
  "I still love her voice here like whoever said she sounds bad better shut up cuz she probably sings better than u",
  "I just heard this song on Alexa and LOVE it! I had to ask who sang it! Go JenLaw!",
  "Me to. I love it ​@@s4ls4l18",
  "And actually I think her voice is really calming",
  "There is alway a group with envy and fear. We will never all get along but understand of other is growth and respect of other is some thing some will never know.",
  "She can also be a mother and a provider with a passion. We can be more than the limits we falsely put in front of other.",
  "Don\u0027t worry, she can take it.",
  "I haven\u0027t seen any of those comments but just in general yeah. If you don\u0027t like someone then just leave, don\u0027t be mean or rude like jeeze",

  "God I wish YouTube wouldn\u0027t send you a notification for someone replying to a comment you also replied to. I should only get the notification IF I get @",
  "She has a sexy jazz standard vibe to her voice, so anybody who doesn’t like it just turn it off Don’t bother her or any of us with your criticism. This is about celebrating our individual missions and paths.",
  "She sounds fine to me...its about the momentum she builds, and the epic score! It works. And I love Ballard of Songbirds and snakes 💜",
  "And if I myself was singing like  that I would consider myself blessed with grate singing voice",
  "Katnis is a fighter not a singer this suits her perfectly",
  "Who said",
  "Some people would find something wrong with anything or anyone.",
  "I think she\u0027s an amazing singer and actress",

  "Also not a bad voice, so…",
  "@@kaytlynfan4403doesn’t fit her might be a concession, she’s not bad at all, and people need to get over themselves. Not saying you, I actually think your comment was mostly right, but yeah, she didn’t do bad here either, so…",

  "Imo it\u0027s supposed to be internally fragile and raw. It\u0027s not meant to be a pop song. Lol",
  "And yet when you watch it in the movie it sounds really good.. For her being an actress she actually pulled off the song better than expected....",

  "I think they are envying this song",
  "raw and real. check out also (unrelated from Jennifer Lawrence) but actresses that do mini virtuous  vs    as much as i like the polished version, i much prefer that raw, rich, passion one where u can see they\u0027re tying to pour their heart into it.. Fuck anyone who carries on about how poor the performance some one does,  in any act,  as that is not.. the purpose of it.. its in the delivery and feeling into it.",
  "This song is alright but I get so annoyed when I hear it every 10 scrolls",
  "She still sounds good. Her voice is a gruff bit and lends itself well to this haunting melody. Pink has a bit of a gruff voice too. I like it.",

  "And she still Sounds nice in this Song. ✌🏼",
  "That’s right. This is based on a poem written in 1939, and a writer for The Hunger Games put music to it. Jennifer’s character sang it for the movie. If her character had been played by someone else, that person would have sung the song! 👍",

Look, not everyone can sing. But she tried her best to do the role of Katniss, and that includes singing this song. I wish people would think before writing judgemental comments that are not based on truth and common sense. :)",

Ever since the Hunger Games movies were announced, I wondered how they were going to handle the singing parts, since I\u0027ve never heard Ms. Lawrence sing before. But wow, she sounds GOOD! Soft enough to involve mood, but raspy enough not to sound bubblegum pop-ish. Well done, Ms. Lawrence!!!",

  "I JUMPED MY ASS OF THE CHAIR WHEN PEETA DID THAT TO KATNISS. XD",
  "In the book they said that Peeta is brainwashed",
  "I literally screamed so loud!",
  "Snow use Peeta against Katniss because in Catching fire, when Peeta gets electrocuted by the forcefield,snow realizes that Katniss loves Peeta, so Peeta became a perfect weapon to break Katniss. This is a \"clue\" in the book that Katniss truly loves Peeta, if Snow realizes that Katniss loves Gale he would never use Peeta to reach Katniss. In the book Katniss feelings is very confused, she never says nothing clearly about her feelings. When i read the book i see Gale more like a sibling than a \"lover\", but..well... that is my opinion :)",
  "Robert Ashcom yes",
  "Did you see how bad he was pulling the rope because he was tied down. His arms were bleeding because he was pulling so hard. They also brainwashed PETA to kill Katniss that\u0027s why he even attacked her in the first place.",

  "I love that you can still tell it\u0027s Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s voice. Most of the time when someone sings in a movie, they\u0027re so enhanced they don\u0027t sound like themselves anymore. They just added a little echo to her voice, it makes it sound really old. I love it!",
  "I\u0027m so with you girl! ♡",
  "they made it sound epic. ",
  "świetna piosenka :) I is a good song i love then :)",
  "I love song is a betiful song",

  "Watched the movie \u003c3 anyone else did?",
  "Sehr sehr gutes Lied :-)",
  "She\u0027s a superb actress... As a singer... Not so much... Or at least  not this genre of music...",
  "Германия",
  "3",
  "she killed this song dats why i love katniss she is the best actor",
  "the song is nice but kinda creepy.",
  "ria",
  "Like this song",
  "i love it",
  "ILOVE THIS SONG!!!!!!!!!",
  "Post: \"Are you coming to the tree?\" on every video you watch. It doesn\u0027t have to be hunger games related.",
  "I\u0027m definitely going to do that lol. I wonder if it\u0027ll get a reaction on some One Direction videos 😏",
  "Kind off sounds like a song sang by a serial killer orso :P",
  "Gonna do this!!",
  "Darude - Sandstorm",
  "Kaitlyn Clark  YAAASSS BIATCH YAASS!!!",
  "No. ",
  "Doing this 😄",
  "Let\u0027s NOT makes this the next \"darude-sandstorm\".  Doing this will only make people hate the song!",
  "No. Just no.",
  "Shut up",
  "If you read the series you\u0027ll get it",
  "I will do that!!!! haha \u003c3",
  "I love this song, but.... NO",
  "How about no.",
  "ThatHauntFreak2 Good idea!  While we\u0027re at it, why don\u0027t we all just toss our modems into the sea and start spontaneously combusting?  (jk--hope you all take this with a grain of salt.  the interwebs are a strange and wonderful place!)",
  "This song was made just for the movie she didn\u0027t want it to be a music video",
  "Flora Gaona The song is in the book.",
  "I\u0027ll do that. It would be funny",
  "Katarzyna Krzyżanowska  i ment she was just wanting to do this song she has no interest in being a singer from what i heard then again everything is he said she said",
  "I have done this People have been like \"On my way\" \"dafuq\" \"Great song\"",
  "Gay",
  "dunno why but its just give me a goosebump",
  "Is this a musical or a dystopian movie? No one will ever know",
  "She has a great voice love this song",
  "Have yet to see the movie but heard this song and immediately thought of Strange Fruit by Billie Holiday. Both hauntingly beautiful. ",
  "THIS SONG HITS ME RIGHT IN THE FEELS",
  "Ok so I had this image of what the song would be like... But I have to say that this is amazing too (even if Jennifer doesn\u0027t sing), especially when everybody starts singing!",
  "Why is this so much quieter than any other video ._.",
  "The rasp of her voice adds so much to this!",
  "I loved the part when the group of prisonners sign in and go to battle",
  "Love the song so much, in the movie through~~~",
  "This song gives me chills! So good!",
  "Can every1 stop spoiling things that happens in the movie. goshhh",
  "This scene was awesome like the people fight of the peacekeepers and blew up the dam so the capital would have no power like so amazing! LOVE IT :)",
  "So soft and soothing, I like.",
  "Makes me wanna start a rebellion",
  "BRUH!",
  "mr moon",
  "Jennifer Lawrence won\u0027t even listen to the song because she says she can\u0027t sing",
  "Jenn sounds so real and raw and it adds emotion to the song and the movie.",
  "SPOILER ALERT  Some people are no real fans here if you where scared of peeta bud if you read the books you knew it happend ohhh and in the next movie finnick and prim die gale moves to an other district and katniss and peeta go back to district 12 an get children",
  "Fuck off.",
  "liarr",
  "I love how everyone thinks this person is Lyon g and he/she is stating the absolute truth.",
  "Gina Kay I love how \"everyone\" is just two people where one you misread the connotation and the other was most likely not serious.",
  "I also love how people think they know everything. Maybe I wasnt talking about your comment Or maybe I wasn\u0027t even taking about the commenting people on YouTube and I was talking about the group of friends that read the comments with me. Yeah, that sounds like what I was talking about.",
  "Actually she\u0027s telling the truth. Prim \u0026 Finnick die, Gale does move to another district while Katniss and Peta go back to district 12. In the prologue/ epilogue or what ever it\u0027s called lol. It clearly states that Katniss and Peta have a daughter and a son. Read the book dam it! Everyone thinks the lies are true. Then when someone actually does tell the truth they get called liers. JUST READ THE BOOK. I mean if you really want to you could just read the last chapter of mockingjay to decide for yourself if it\u0027s true. Okay My rant is over.....  Have a happy day. Or in My case have a great night ☺",
  "Gina Kay Then why would you comment on this specific comment thread? Nice try.",
  "Kacy Hostetter Not everyone reads the book, why is that so hard to respect? Stop spoiling it for people.",
  "Well maybe they should before calling someone a lier. And damn you take everything so seriously don\u0027t ya?",
  "Kacy Hostetter First of all, it\u0027s spelled \"liar\". Secondly, I\u0027m pretty sure this Alexsandra girl wasn\u0027t serious *whatsoever*. \"Damn you take everything so serious don\u0027t ya?\" says the person who writes a shit long comment just because one person wrote the word \"liarr\". ",
  "DONT SPOIL IT",
  "Can I ask why they changed the lyric from \u0027rope\u0027 to \u0027hope\u0027 in the movie??",
  "It was explained during the movie.",
  "Okay thanks ",
  "Because they wanted it to sound hopeful instead of like they were heading to die",
  "But, that was the point wasn\u0027t it? The man had died, but his lover was going to come for him anyway?",
  "Abigail Connell what?",
  "It was to help spark the revolution example the hydro dam rebel",
  "The song originally is from district 12, it was a song she sang with her father. Yeah its about two lovers etc. but district 13 wanted a good propos, propaganda so they changed it to make it relevant. They did it in the book too pretty sure.",
  "No they didn\u0027t in the book it was rope.",
  "Abigail Connell But in the movie(which this song is from) it was hope",
  "Plutarch arranged to have the song changed to inspire the districts to rebel. That\u0027s why it\u0027s different. In the movie, that is.",
  "In the movie he guy, the old gamemaker(cant remember his name) says \"it was original necklace of rope but i had to change it to hope..\" so me and my friend said they new the fandom would get all made so they had to address it in the movie haha. but hope does help more for the revolution if you think about it :)",
  "The staff didn\u0027t want it to be a depressing music... It insipires people that fight against the capitol, it became their military song really fast and they got more hope of of this song, but it actually ment for peeta, katniss wanted to meet him in the midnight under the tree... :)",
  "I never liked the movies anyways",
  "Aryell Sophia Mockingjay P1 was actually outstanding.",
  "Katrina Chavez his name is plutarch",
  "Plutrach wanted to use it in a propo, and he thought that it was better if she said hope anf not hope.",
  "I watched the film and this song has been stuck in my head ever since",
  "she is such an amazing singer I want to sing with her one day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
  "I love this song",
  "I Love This Song \u003c33",
  "they actually changed: a necklace of rope, by a ... Of hope. Lol",
  "The only thing that makes me mad about this version is they change the line \u0027rope\u0027 into \u0027hope\u0027. Originally, it was \u0027rope\u0027 in the book...",
  "They explain this in the film... Plutarch changes the line to hope to make the song more marketable.",
  "Did you not see the movie?",
  "Yes, I did. Twice. I guess its one of those things if you read the book first and are a fan of the book firstly than, the book will be be better than then movie.... I wish there was a opera cover of this...",
  "IVE JUST COVERED THIS! It would mean loads if you could check it out :)",
  "Best song ever",
  "I think Jennifer sings it so beautiful,and in the movie,it even sounds much better.The way people rebel with that song..I just love it!",
  "Wonder if JLaw sing live . Her voice will be ugly if she not lypsynce.",
  "It wasn\u0027t lipsync she actually said she didn\u0027t want to be part of the movie just becuase of the singing part",
  "LA MEJOR PELÍCULA DEL MUNDO💕",
  "i love this song so much but i haven\u0027t seen the film yet but i know that district 13 gets blown up :3",
  "hama sian um guys you do know it got blown up and thats why they hide underground?",
  "Nope, not blown up, just bombed. It survives.",
  "It was announced it got blown up in the second one, which came out a LONG time ago. There\u0027s nothing to spoil anymore, you had your chance to watch it, it\u0027s free to discuss now.",
  "no i\u0027ve watched bot of em there was no part in any of the movies that it was gonna blow up",
  "theseeyasuckashow *facepalm* SPOILER ALERT No, we mean that it\u0027s gonna be blown up again. The point is, district 13 still exists. But everyone thinks it doesn\u0027t because the surface got bombed by the Capitol. But they survived underground. In Mockingjay they bomb it again though, so that\u0027s what were talking about. But yeah the point is, they survive AGAIN.",
  "It\u0027s not really a spoiler... unless you haven\u0027t read the books.",
  "Riley Lewis Many people haven\u0027t read the book, neither did I... Children these days... (including me :P)",
  "Actually it gets bombed but noone dies",
  "Kyle Schmauss actually it gets bombed and many people die just not all like the capitol wanted the districts to think",
  "Patricia Wisenbaker In the film nobody dies.",
  "in the book a lot of them die just not all of them",
  "No it does not I went and saw it I didn\u0027t",
  "Georgia Hurst But he means in the book.",
  "Wow amazing",
  "such an epic track. And it caught me so because it\u0027s herself singing, not a singer",
  "Even though Jennifer isn\u0027t in the music industry, I think her voice is beautiful and fits the song perfectly. The raspiness of it just adds to the meaning of the song. For those that didn\u0027t know, she was crying on set the day they had to film her singing The Hanging Tree. So I hope you don\u0027t bash her singing, she really did have to push herself to do this.",
  "Why was she crying...",
  "Michelle Jean Saquing She has said in many interviews that she hates singing and really cannot handle her own voice. To her, her voice sounds like a deer that has been caught in a fence and she really hates it.",
  "👍👍",
  "Mado mi vengono i brividi...Un saluto dall\u0027Italia",
  "Movie*",
  "For me...the best scene in the move...i love it ♡",
  "Love it 💖📣📢🎶🎵",
  "Are you are you",
  "CAN SUM1 MAKE A DUBSTEP RMX OF THIS PLZ???",
  "Wtf, this does not fit dubstep at all.",
  "мyѕтιc it actually does",
  "How about no one does because this should never be made into dupstep you stupid 11 year old. Probably the worst idea I\u0027ve heard today",
  "the song is beautiful as it is. we don\u0027t need a shitty dubstep remix to ruin it, thank you.",
  "They are playing a kind of dubstep/remix version of it on youtube. It turned this song into the crappiest thing my ears have heard",
  "Since I already read the books, I\u0027ll ep",
  "Honestly I thought this was the best part of the movie, and I don\u0027t know why she thought she can\u0027t sing because she has an awesome voice",
  "Beautifull!",
  "Same i was just like what that just happened",
  "Best movie ever! #philippines",
  "I love the song so much!",
  "Jen, you are a fucking legend. You are incredible at absolutely everything and still manage to be yourself. Bowing down for eternity. Love you girl",
  "bit creepy innit",
  "I love so much the Hanging Tree song,\u0026 after finished watch a Mokingjay im try to find this lovely song..\u0026 finally i found the track title of the song in a n/paper \u0026 keep download it!",
  "Do you should not talk like that and PS spoiling like it when you tension",
  "One of the best scenes and movie song ever",
  "I am, but are YOU coming to the tree?",
  "Can someone write lyrics to me? Because my English not much good. I cant understand words when I hear.",
  "Do you speak spanish? O whats ?",
  "Pp Leon No, my main language is Turkish. But if you write lyrics with english, I can translate it myself. I just need to words.",
  "The whole song wouldnt post but the last two are just some of the other paragraphs repeated :) youre welcome that took me a while to write",
  "Piya Pat Thank you :)",
  "Perfeitaaaaaa",
  "This song is good",
  "fucking love this song.",
  "I just died",
  "Oh my buns!",
  "aqui é HU3BR carai.",
  "Another SPOILER ALERT:Peeta tried to kill Katniss becuz he was infected with tracker jacker venom",
  "When you do a \"spoiler alert\" let spaces beetween your spoil",
  "They already said that. I believe. Or I\u0027m just making scenes up that I read about...",
  "I get goosebumps every time I listen to this music",
  "Yea she said she is not a singer",
  "Yeah and she says she\u0027s not a singer",
  "Are you Are you  Getting out of my head you damn song",
  "Esto me produce un ajhdhkbgnkgjulkgjdahglgnpju \u003c3",
  "she sounds like....christina perri?",
  "It\u0027s the raspiness of her voice lol... I listen to Christina Perri as well and noticed it. When I actually put effort into my singing, I sound like them both so, yeah it\u0027s the raspiness in her voice.",
  "***** How does she sound like Adele..?",
  "amazing song and Jennifer/katniss amazing singing",
  "Aahhhh.... Such an amazing song... Gives me chills and I can\u0027t stop listening to it! Jennifer did a fantastic job at singing it (:",
  "Loveeeee ♡♡♡♡♡",
  "Jen is actually a super talented singer!!",
  "I don\u0027t know about the book (didn\u0027t read) but the movie... ok let\u0027s say Twilight saga is from the same category (I\u0027m vomiting on twilight)",
  "❤️❤️❤️❤️",
  "immigrant song",
  "More of a droning chant than a song.  Sucks.",
  "that\u0027s the point:)",
  "Could I get the lyrics? Thanks! :D",
  "ojala que tambien salga el arbol del ahorcado cantada por Jennifer pero en español como estaba en la peli",
  "La traducción de ingles a español fue un verdadero asco!! 😡",
  "I\u0027m coming to the tree with you katniss !",
  "They literally stripped the audio from the movie and put it on a record label.... well played...",
  "Its part of the movies score, so therefore its part of the soundtrack ",
  "Do you know how movie soundtracks work? Don\u0027t answer. This is what we call a rhetorical question. :|",
  "That is called a Soundtrack, or Score, and it is sold separately, and written, recored and all separately, while it is used in the movie, many people like to listen to these soundtracks. I prefer it over mainstream music.",
  "Devin Randolph Whoops, already explained it.",
  "Me encanta esta canción \u003c3",
  "They should make a video of this song in film cuz just the song dont show everything",
  "Her voice reminds me of xenia from the voice. I really like it."
