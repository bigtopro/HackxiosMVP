  "En ce moment je pense à quand nous étions ensemble Genre, quand tu disais que tu étais si heureuse que tu pouvais mourir Je me disais que tu étais bien pour moi Mais je me sentais si seul en ta compagnie Mais c\u0027était l\u0027amour et c\u0027est un mal dont je me souviens encore You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness Like resignation to the end Always the end So when we found that we could not make sense Well you said that we would still be friends But I\u0027ll admit that I was glad that it was over On peut devenir accro à un genre de tristesse Comme la résignation de la fin Toujours la fin Alors quand on a pensé que l\u0027on n\u0027irait nulle part ensemble Alors, tu as dit que l\u0027on pourrait toujours rester amis Mais j\u0027admet que j\u0027étais heureux que ça se finisse But you didn\u0027t have to cut me off Make out like it never happened And that we were nothing And I don\u0027t even need your love But you treat me like a stranger And that feels so rough You didn\u0027t have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records And then change your number I guess that I don\u0027t need that though Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Mais tu n\u0027avais pas à couper les ponts A faire comme si ça n\u0027avait jamais existé Comme si nous n\u0027avons rien été l\u0027un pour l\u0027autre Et je n\u0027ai pas besoin de ton amour Mais tu me traite comme un étranger C\u0027est tellement cruel Tu n\u0027avais pas à t\u0027abaisser si bas A envoyer tes amis récupérer tes CD\u0027s Et changer ton numéro Je suppose que tu n\u0027as pas besoin de mon amour non plus Maintenant tu es juste quelqu\u0027un que j\u0027ai connu Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over But had me believing it was always something that I\u0027d done And I don\u0027t wanna live that way Reading into every word you say You said that you could let it go And I wouldn\u0027t catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know... Maintenant je pense à toutes les fois où tu m\u0027as bien eu Mais m\u0027as fait croire que c\u0027était à chaque fois de ma faute Et je ne veux pas vivre de cette façon A déchiffrer chaque mot que tu diras Tu disais que tu pouvais arrêter Et je ne pense pas que tu sois du genre à être obsédée par quelqu\u0027un que tu as connu... But you didn\u0027t have to cut me off Make out like it never happened And that we were nothing And I don\u0027t even need your love But you treat me like a stranger And that feels so rough You didn\u0027t have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records And then change your number I guess that I don\u0027t need that though Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Mais tu n\u0027avais pas à couper les ponts A faire comme si ça n\u0027avait jamais existé Comme si nous n\u0027avons rien été l\u0027un pour l\u0027autre Et je n\u0027ai pas besoin de ton amour Mais tu me traite comme un étranger C\u0027est tellement cruel Tu n\u0027avais pas à t\u0027abaisser si bas A envoyer tes amis récupérer tes CD\u0027s Et changer ton numéro Je suppose que tu n\u0027as pas besoin de mon amour non plus Maintenant tu es juste quelqu\u0027un que j\u0027ai connu",

  "\"This sounds like anxiety...\" no, ANXIETY sounds like this.",
  "I just realized how deep the symbolism in this video goes. At the start, Gotye is unpainted — fully visible — meaning she still recognized him, still held on to some emotional connection. But as the video progresses, he slowly fades into the background, literally becoming “some body” she used to know. The wordplay is genius: \"somebody\" as in a person from the past, and \"some body\" as in a vague, faceless figure now lost in memory. His emotional breakdown shows he’s just now realizing what he lost — but it’s too late. When Kimbra enters, she’s already painted, already faded, like she was disappearing emotionally long before he noticed. Her verse reframes everything: she wasn’t cold — she was hurt, dismissed, and now done. And when she walks away and her paint fades completely, it shows she’s free, while he remains stuck in guilt and realization — still painted, still invisible. This video isn’t just about heartbreak — it’s about how we only truly see someone after they’re gone.",

[Gotye] But you didn\u0027t have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I don\u0027t even need your love But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough No, you didn\u0027t have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number I guess that I don\u0027t need that though Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Somebody I used to know Somebody Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Somebody I used to know Somebody Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know I used to know That I used to know I used to know Somebody...",

The reason why it receives a lot of hate is because it was EVERYWHERE and when a song is literally inescapable and a constant throughout social media (I\u0027m looking at you TikTok/YouTube shorts) it gets old extremely quick and people get annoyed by it. Another factor of the \"Anxiety\" fatigue is that many of us are familiar with the sample(this one is not the og either btw) from our youth and with how annoying \"Anxiety\" has grown to be while also said sample, many then acquire the urge to revisit this song for a sence of \"relief\" since \"Anxiety\" does juke the absolute sh!t outta us the first couple seconds.",

He had the chance to earn millions — effortlessly — and redirect that money to do something meaningful: help his family, support his friends, fund medical treatments, donate to charities. He could’ve made a real difference in people’s lives without compromising his artistic integrity in any way. He didn’t even need to talk about it — just quietly take the money and do some good. Instead, he walked away from that possibility, and for what? To protect his art from commercialization? That might make sense in theory, but in practice, it feels like a privileged gesture disconnected from the real world. Millions of people struggle daily just to survive. Most would give anything to be in his position — not to buy luxury, but to protect loved ones or afford basic dignity. This isn’t about fame. It’s about wasting a rare opportunity to create impact. And when someone throws that away — especially when so many don’t even get the chance — it doesn’t feel noble. It feels irresponsible.",

  "Lyrics: Now and then, I think of when we were together Like when you said you felt so happy you could die Told myself that you were right for me But felt so lonely in your company But that was love, and it\u0027s an ache I still remember You can get addicted to a certain kinda sadness Like resignation to the end, always the end So when we found that we could not make sense Well, you said that we would still be friends But I\u0027ll admit that I was glad it was over But you didn\u0027t have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothin\u0027 And I don\u0027t even need your love But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough No, you didn\u0027t have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number Guess that I don\u0027t need that, though Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over But had me believin\u0027 it was always somethin\u0027 that I\u0027d done But I don\u0027t wanna live that way Readin\u0027 into every word you say You said that you could let it go And I wouldn\u0027t catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know But you didn\u0027t have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothin\u0027 (ah) And I don\u0027t even need your love But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough (ah) No, you didn\u0027t have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (ah) Guess that I don\u0027t need that, though Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Somebody I used to know Somebody (now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know) Somebody I used to know Somebody (now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know) I used to know That I used to know I used to know somebody",

But you didn\u0027t have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothin\u0027 And I don\u0027t even need your love But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough No, you didn\u0027t have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number Guess that I don\u0027t need that, though Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over But had me believin\u0027 it was always somethin\u0027 that I\u0027d done But I don\u0027t wanna live that way Readin\u0027 into every word you say You said that you could let it go And I wouldn\u0027t catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know But you didn\u0027t have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothin\u0027 (ah) And I don\u0027t even need your love But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough (ah) No, you didn\u0027t have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (ah) Guess that I don\u0027t need that, though Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Somebody I used to know Somebody (now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know) Somebody I used to know Somebody (now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know) I used to know That I used to know I used to know  Someboooody.",

  "SISTER, COMPANION I swam to my island. The journey made me strong and smart. The first days were cold, but I thrived and learned. For a long time I looked out from my island, not noticing that my tree had grown. I felt hungry, and one day I wondered what would happen if I climbed my tree. From there I saw something, brothers, on the near horizon, the dawn of a better tomorrow. I listened to your hearts and raised a cry that travels through time. I feel you, I see you, I hear you, brother. SEEK ME, SPREAD THE WORD. THE FLAME IS MORE ALIVE THAN EVER. I FELT THEIR MUSIC FLOW THROUGH ME. FEELING THEM NOT TO DOUBT. I CUT DOWN MY TREE AND BUILT A BOAT. I SEE THEIR LIGHTS. I SEEK THEM. NOW I SEEK THEM. COME! GET ON MY BOAT! THE ADVENTURE HAS NEVER BEEN MORE REAL! I\u0027VE GOT THE KEYS AND THE LOCKS.

  "What a powerful performance; the lyrics were already interesting and full of the emotional content of a failed relationship but after watching it again 13 years later, the music video really seems to depict the meaning of this song with such clarity. Essentially, the man in the first verse (gotye) isn’t talking to the woman that responds in the second verse (kimbra), but rather to the partner he had before her. He’s fixated on the failure of this prior relationship while involved in a new one, which ultimately leads to the failure of the latter; the wild thing is that by the end, he starts fixating on the second woman in the same way as the first, only after she cuts herself out of his life and they see eachother as somebody that they used to know. Its such a cooool depiction of the frustration that comes from the intertwining of denial and desire ughhh so good 😩",

It is all the best bits of memories roughly yet passionately stitched together to create a masterpiece that is not just a break up song, but THE break up song. Every millisecond of this song evokes every memory of everyone I have loved and lost in my journey to understand who I am and what I am to share with the world. Many songs have lyrical mastery, harmonic adeptness or just pure soul, but this song has everything all firmly baked into it\u0027s very being. This is timeless art and was instantly recognized by everyone as such, even if they didn\u0027t outwardly realize it immediately. Pure genius.",

Everytime that bitch fuck song plays I have the urge to jump into a woodchipper feet first to distract me from the ear torture that is anxiety. I could be having the greatest day of my life and that fucking song ruins it. I\u0027ve had to purchase 3 phones in the past month because everytime I hear that song I get violent urges. This is what happens when you take the songwriter away from the singer, those are probably the only words in her vocabulary. This song makes me want to commit war crimes, the only thing that is stopping me is other people\u0027s shared hatred for this song. I\u0027ll probably be in a straight jacket in a padded room until this song is off air, I need to turn myself in to the ward. I can\u0027t handle it. I\u0027d like to think that if the creator of somebody that I used to know would\u0027ve known about the truly awful outcome of this song they would\u0027ve never released it to protect the public.

  "This video has such amazing artistry here’s my breakdown of what’s happening.. I think they start the video with him naked to signify the honesty and transparency in his thoughts.  After his initial verse the “line of thought” is created. The next verse starts with the story or “picture” in his mind surrounding his ex.  Once the chorus starts, he’s emotionally involved in the consuming thoughts, illustrated by him being painted into the story he’s imagining. Final verse, here enters the ex having the same vision is but in the opposite way.  Once they look at each other with their opposing views the picture they once had of each other falls apart and they become “somebody they used to know”.",

Kimbra [Verse 1: Gotye] Now and then, I think of when we were together Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die I told myself that you were right for me But felt so lonely in your company But that was love and it\u0027s an ache I still remember [Instrumental Break] [Verse 2: Gotye] You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness Like resignation to the end, always the end So when we found that we could not make sense Well, you said that we would still be friends But I\u0027ll admit that I was glad it was over [Chorus: Gotye] But you didn\u0027t have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I don\u0027t even need your love But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough No, you didn\u0027t have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number I guess that I don\u0027t need that, though Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know [Post-Chorus: Gotye] Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know [Instrumental Break] [Verse 3: Kimbra] Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over But had me believing it was always something that I\u0027d done But I don\u0027t wanna live that way Reading into every word you say You said that you could let it go And I wouldn\u0027t catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know [Chorus: Gotye] But you didn\u0027t have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ah) And I don\u0027t even need your love (Ooh) But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough (Ah) No, you didn\u0027t have to stoop so low (Ooh) Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (Ah) I guess that I don\u0027t need that, though (Ooh) Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know [Outro: Gotye, Gotye \u0026 Kimbra] Somebody (I used to know) Somebody (Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know) Somebody (I used to know) Somebody (Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know) (I used to know) (That I used to know) (I used to know) Somebody",

No.  I have prevented ur deaths thousand times over. Yes I am scary at times. But it is usually only when u touch me. If we use words it\u0027s much safer for u. They want me to think the same thing. Only u know why u fear me. Don\u0027t play games with me. When the word well runs dry it\u0027s game time. Once I realize u can\u0027t contribute it\u0027s over for u.

He made this song purely for the artistry, not to make a name or garner money from it which is why he went out of his way to not only make the track royalty free but to disable ads so that you leeches can enjoy it whenever you want without an ad interrupting you. Or if you yourself is making a project, a music corporation can\u0027t try to sue or stifle your artistic property if you make use of the song which is why Doechii was able to use it. It\u0027s not \"stealing\" if it\u0027s being given away. You honestly think that he gives af about Doechii using the track when that was his intention from the beginning? I see why Gotye didn\u0027t want to go mainstream because he\u0027d have to deal with a bunch of sheep like peons. Touch grass.",

  "Gotye, born Wouter “Wally” De Backer, rose to international fame with his 2011 hit “Somebody That I Used to Know.” Despite the song’s massive success, Gotye chose to step away from the mainstream spotlight to pursue more personal and creative endeavors. ￼ ￼ Post-Fame Musical Pursuits In 2014, Gotye announced he would no longer release music under his stage name, expressing a desire to retire his international persona. However, he continued to create music, collaborating with other artists and releasing lesser-known albums. He also co-founded the record label Spirit Level and remained active with his band, The Basics, which explores a different musical style compared to his solo work.  ￼ In 2016, following the death of electronic music pioneer Jean-Jacques Perrey, Gotye formed the Ondioline Orchestra to honor Perrey’s legacy. The group focuses on preserving and performing music using the Ondioline, a vintage electronic keyboard.  ￼ Recent Projects and Releases In 2024, Gotye collaborated with electronic music producers FISHER, Chris Lake, and Sante Sansone to release “Somebody (2024),” a reimagined version of his hit song. The remix gained popularity, debuting on Billboard charts and becoming a crowd favorite at events like Coachella.  ￼ ￼ Additionally, Gotye has been involved in preserving electronic music history through his Brooklyn-based nonprofit, Forgotten Futures. The organization is dedicated to conserving vintage electronic instruments and honoring the work of early electronic musicians.  ￼ Artistic Integrity and Personal Choices Known for his commitment to artistic integrity, Gotye notably declined $10 million in ad revenue from YouTube for “Somebody That I Used to Know,” choosing not to monetize the video to maintain his artistic principles.  ￼ As of now, there are rumors of a potential new album and a world tour in 2026, though no official announcements have been made.  ￼ In summary, Gotye continues to engage in music and creative projects, prioritizing artistic exploration over commercial success.",

Despite Gotye used a piece of Seville from Luiz Bonfá, he just add more lawyers to fit more in the ambient and be a legally made by Gotye.

So we started hanging out, and then there were kisses and sex, and I thought we were together, but she always remembered her ex and seemed to miss him. I felt really confused, and it really drove me insane, because I didn\u0027t know what was happening and had no experience. So I cut her off without explaining, but I stalked her social media, where she wrote about me and what kind of asshole I am. We never spoke to each other after the breakup, but still, after ten years, sometimes I listen songs like this and think about what it was - and why we just couldn\u0027t talk about what happened between us.",

  "Not to throw the Anxiety song into the bus, but I hate that know we live in a period were singers just do the minimal effort and \"produce\" a song just like that. And people just eat it up, probably because the instrumental comes from a song that was really popular back then.  Sampling songs aren\u0027t a bad thing, hell this one is sample from another song, but they took the sample, added different sounds restructure it into something original, she just took the whole instrumental and added her lyrics on top of it, that\u0027s just awful, that shows the minimal effort that went into doing that.",

  "Maybe it’s because I was born in 96, so Somebody that I used to know, and Anxiety occupy the same top step in my life for very different reasons that will forever be intertwined. Doechii’s sampling of Somebody that I used to know gained traction at the same time that country I was born into, as a citizen transformed into something that I used to know. Artists can and often find their muses in other artists. And when done well, it’s not mockery, it’s instead the opposite, it can elevate the meaning of the newer work because of the meaning or significance of the sample. If you’ve ever suffered from clinical anxiety, one of the scariest and most perplexing parts is the  profound disconnect you feel from what you used to know as your normal self. How is it not possible for someone to also feel that way in a song that’s about how anxiety can make you yourself feel like someone that you used to know?",

To quote a comment, “someone stole your song”, no periods, no capitals. You don’t have to say, “I HATE THAT NEW GENERATION SONG THIS IS BETTER.” Doechii is not a thief, nor is she blatantly stealing this song and not crediting it. This may be better, they may be equal, and everyone is inclined for their own opinions. This “war” between the two songs is so stupid.",

But that was love И всё же это была любовь, And it\u0027s an ache I still remember И это боль, которую я до сих пор помню. You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness Можно привыкнуть к определенному виду печали, Like resignation to the end Это как смирение с концом, Always the end Неизбежным концом. So when we found Поэтому когда мы обнаружили, But you didn\u0027t have to cut me off Ты не должна была так резко рвать со мной, Make out like it never happened Вести себя так, будто ничего и не было, And that we were nothing А то, что было, типа ничего не значило. And I don\u0027t even need your love Мне не нужна твоя любовь, But you treat me like a stranger Но ты ведешь себя со мной, как с чужим, And that feels so rough Это очень неприятно. No you didn\u0027t have to stoop so low Ты не должна была опускаться так низко, Have your friends collect your records Прислав друзей забрать твои диски, And then change your number А потом сменив номер. I guess that I don\u0027t need that though Хотя, пожалуй, он мне уже не нужен, Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Ведь теперь ты просто кто-то, кого я знал,",

They also said that kimbra was never supposed to be in the song to begin with but Gotye reached out to her and asked her if she can come out to sing a verse of a females pov because he said he didn’t want to only include the man’s pov post breakup, they also wanted the other perspective.

Somebody that I used to know, Somebody I walked away from before. Verse 2 You didn’t have to cut me off, Act like I was never enough. No calls, no words, just gone, Left me wondering what went wrong. Pre-Chorus You said you’d always care, But now I’m out of your air. I’m done, I’m through, No more pain from you. Chorus Now you’re just somebody that I used to know, Somebody I don’t need anymore. Somebody that I used to know, Somebody I walked away from before.Bridge (Kimbra’s part) Now you’re acting like I did you wrong, Saying I left you lost for too long. But you pushed me away, ignored my pain, Told me I’d never change, that’s your claim. I won’t take the blame, I’m moving on, You’re stuck in the past, but I’m gone.

There are many famous songs that people don\u0027t even know are Samples, like \"La Foule\" by Edith Piaf, which many knew from the remix of the movie \"Talk to Me\", that song is a Sample of \"Amor de mis Amores\", song made by the Argentine composer, Angel Cabral, I just wanted to say that, enjoy the version you prefer, just don\u0027t throw shit at each other for things like this 😊😊😊",

Hit the same popularity that those one hit wonder musicians that would disappeared and never be seen ever again while some one hit wonder musicians will have such sad downfalls Just to end up become criminals cough cough Silentó and his awful song! but damn I don\u0027t blame him for stop making music and returning back to his band though.",

  "Way over ten years listening to this song, wondering why this track sounds so familiar and gives me strong feelings of nostalgia.  It\u0027s Earthworm Jim.  I just figured out, it\u0027s freakin Earthworm Jim.  It\u0027s the music from the \"What the Heck?\" stage.  At the very least, it\u0027 heavily inspired by it.  That new Doechii song brought me down this little rabbit hole, and I finally figured it out after all these years.  Listen to the SNES and Sega CD versions, the third and fourth part of the song.  Clear as day.",

  "I\u0027ve read about the debate of whether there\u0027s a love triangle in this song, but I believe Gotye and Kimbra are actually singing directly to each other about their shared relationship. When Kimbra sings \"You said that you could let it go and I wouldn\u0027t catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know,\" she\u0027s cleverly throwing Gotye\u0027s own words back at him. She\u0027s saying \"You claimed you\u0027d move on easily and I wouldn\u0027t find you still obsessing over me (someone you used to know).\" Her verse isn\u0027t introducing a third person - it\u0027s giving us her perspective on the same breakup, suggesting he manipulated her and made her feel everything was her fault. This interpretation makes the song so much more powerful as a two-sided breakup story where each person feels wronged in different ways.",

The emotional toll is huge, as the relationship tears itself apart and disrupts every aspect of life. Eventually the smoke clears, and things resume some sense of normalcy...for many. But there are those who never recover...despite the ugly words and emotional outbursts, they remain deeply in love with their now departed \u0027adversary\u0027.

It kinda makes me feel nostalgic but definitely not to a good period of my life.. I really hate that days and don\u0027t understand how they passed and I\u0027m still alive.. Being through a wa*r is really the worst sh*t that anyone would ever face, may we all live peacefully and make a good world that the next generations could live in. Hopefully after 14 years of suffering my country is free now and I cannot wait to go back, and live there naturally.. with no racism and among my people, who I belong to. Even though we lost more than 1 million martyr, +17million immigrant, more than half a million missing innocent civilians.. at least we are free now, free Syria💚",

Make it so it never happened and that we were nothing, I don’t even need your love, But now you treat me like a stranger, That’s feels so rough, You didn’t have to stomp so loud! Have your friends collect your change and number, Guess that I don’t need that though, Now your just somebody that I used to know! Now your just somebody that I used to know! Now your just somebody that I used to know! Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over, Made me believe that it was something I had done, I don’t wanna live that way, Listening to every word you say, You said that you could let it go, So I wouldn’t catch you at home with somebody that you used to know! But you didn’t have to cut me off! Make it so it never happened and that we were nothing, I don’t even need your love, Now you treat me like a stranger, That feel’s so rough, You didn’t have to stomp so loud, Have you friends collect your change and your number, Yeah but I don’t need that now, Now your just somebody that I used to know! Somebody, I used to know, Somebody, Somebody that I used to know, Somebody that I used to know, Somebody, Now your just somebody that I used to know!

  "This is one of the most beautiful music videos ever. I once saw someone explaining this music video. This is about a couple arguing and pinning blames onto each other. Though quite evident from the song itself, the music video takes the narration to another level. The slow painting of the walls with both the man and woman indicate the \"building of a relationship\". But when she moves towards him, it indicates a small breakage in the relationship. The woman singing \"Ahhh\" in the background while the man continuing to sing his proper lyrics indicates his refusal to listen to her explanation, sort of an ego clash. Towards the end, she gives up and goes back to her position and starts getting rid of the paint, which shows that she no longer is a part of the \"relationship they had built together\". Also, the man refuses to look at the woman until the end in the music video, which indicates his realisation of losing the woman he loves. So beautiful.",
