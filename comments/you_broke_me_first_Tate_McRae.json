My husband left overnight 6 times saying he was going to work then not coming home and cutting all contact with me (gone for 2 days each time). I found out one time he was drunk at a party, and some other times he said a couple of the times his car broke down. He even admitted he just thought we had a really bad marriage so he stayed out all night to think about it one of the times (cutting contact as always). Now he wants me to take him back, and saying he\u0027s all in this and the ball\u0027s in my court. I\u0027m really disgusted, but I love him.

  "فهمت الآن، تريدين تقريرًا عامًا يناسب الكتاب دون الخوض في تفاصيله. إليك النسخة المعدلة: --- عنوان الكتاب: رحلة إلى الله المؤلف: (يرجى تحديد المؤلف إذا كان معروفًا). مقدمة: \"رحلة إلى الله\" هو كتاب يحمل عنوانًا عميقًا يعبر عن رحلة الإنسان الروحية وسعيه للتقرب من الله. الكتاب يناقش موضوعات تتعلق بالإيمان والتفكير في علاقتنا مع الخالق. موضوع الكتاب: الكتاب يركز على أهمية التأمل والتفكر في حياتنا، وكيف يمكن للإنسان أن يجد السلام الداخلي من خلال الاقتراب من الله. يقدم دروسًا مستوحاة من القيم الإنسانية والإيمانية، مما يجعله مناسبًا للقراء من مختلف الأعمار. رأيي في الكتاب: على الرغم من أنني لم أتمكن من قراءة الكتاب بعد، أعتقد أن موضوعه قيّم ومفيد، لأنه يدعو إلى التأمل والتوبة والعمل على تحسين علاقتنا بالله. --- هذا التقرير بسيط ولا يتطرق لتفاصيل محددة، ويمكنك تقديمه بثقة. إذا أردت أي تعديل إضافي، أنا جاهزة",

Then On the last day we went on a beach walk and At the beach me And my friends we were Making like Castles and stuff And then L just keeps randomly Accusing my other Friends (btw Their My x friends there were mean later in the year) so yeah then I said don’t Listen to her So we just started ignoring her THEN when we do She starts Bursting in Tears LIKE BRUH then after that when we were waiting for the bus we watched a movie and because it was so loud I couldn’t hear her talking to me Then L. Goes of crying again!!!!! And she goes up to my strict teacher(NO JOKE SHE IS LIKE THE STRICTEST TEACHER EVER) and then she gets her attention By crying In front of all of the teachers.Then when we were leaving My Teacher came up to me and my friends and said YOUR NOT GETTING ON THAT BUS UNTIL YOU APOLOGISE TO L and so I didn’t end up saying sorry CAUSE I DID NOTHING WRONG! Anyways that’s camp  STORY 2  So everyday after camp she would always be so rude like say I didn’t let her use my pencil sharpener or something she would be like your so Mean And start crying And say I’ll tell the teacher! (IN MY HEAD OMG JUST SHUT UP) But one day At like the last few minutes We we’re packing up and I said no then she starts crying AGAIN AND IM JUST LIKE BRUHHHHHHH (Btw It was like the day before my birthday) so The teacher went over and As soon as she came over The bell went so I just sprinted home so the next morning I got to school and at like Lunch time my teacher goes Up To me and says Go to Mrs P (she’s a well-being person who just helps when you get angry and stuff like that PS Ashe was my Grade one teacher Strict too) and I was so sad because it was my birthday when I got there she started yelling at me And saying bad stuff that I didn’t do And I was crying INFRONT OF HER SHE ACTED LIKE NOTHING and so I went to my stem teacher Who’s A really nice teacher And I went there to finish Of my Project And I was still crying She let me bring some friends. So basically yeah So I went home I was crying but it still was a really good birthday anyways my dad Let me stay Home the next day And he went on the phone with my assistant principal who’s really nice he said he will Talk to my teacher and L so that’s the story And I will never forget it because that only happened a few months ago TYSM FOR READING LOVE YALL!!!❤❤❤",

She was hit by a speeding car!  It’s 4 years soon and I’ll be forever broken!! 💔 apart of me also died that day.. I’m so grateful for all the memories I have and songs like this, take me back to those times.

  "Lyric Maybe you don\u0027t like talking too much about yourself But you should\u0027ve told me that you were thinkin\u0027 \u0027bout someone else You\u0027re drunk at a party or maybe it\u0027s just that your car broke down Your phone\u0027s been off for a couple months, so you\u0027re calling me now I know you, you\u0027re like this When shit don\u0027t go your way you needed me to fix it And like me, I did But I ran out of every reason Now suddenly you\u0027re asking for it back Could you tell me, where\u0027d you get the nerve? Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had But I don\u0027t really care how bad it hurts When you broke me first You broke me first Took a while, was in denial when I first heard That you moved on quicker than I could\u0027ve ever, you know that hurt Swear for a while I would stare at my phone just to see your name But now that it\u0027s there, I don\u0027t really know what to say I know you, you\u0027re like this When shit don\u0027t go your way you needed me to fix it And like me, I did But I ran out of every reason Now suddenly you\u0027re asking for it back Could you tell me, where\u0027d you get the nerve? Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had But I don\u0027t really care how bad it hurts When you broke me first You broke me first What did you think would happen? What did you think would happen? I\u0027ll never let you have it What did you think would happen? Now suddenly you\u0027re asking for it back Could you tell me, where\u0027d you get the nerve? Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had But I don\u0027t really care how bad it hurts When you broke me first You broke me first (You broke me first) You broke me first, oh",

  "I miss her songs like this. Rubberband and this song are so full of emotion, shows off her unique voice and not just singing to a pop beat humping the ground with her tits out. Why do they do this to female singers? You either play the part or go on underrated and ignored. It\u0027s infuriating. Tate and Ashnikko have been my faves for years. Take a look at Ashnikko\u0027s style of video against what Tate just released, and you immediately know why Ashnikko hasn\u0027t blown up in the same way. It\u0027s sad.",
  "​@@brandicew7704 I agree with you. I don\u0027t know who likes it at all, but personally I find it very disgusting to watch Tate jumping and tumbling in underwear and bras, exposing her genitals, which no longer excite anyone 🤣.

IF there is a guy who can stand up WITH you,  then life would be complete- always watch- i thought i found the one who closed the back door- Regrettably- love is fickle- I love your voice, i love your videos- i only wish the best for you- Thanks so much for sharing your voice, btw- Toronto is my birth-town and i Love it right to death !",

  "This song was released when I had my first break up yup I know you might be wondering “first break up? What do you mean” well it means that I haven’t broken up with anyone before and that was my first break up  He was such a nice person he loved me so much but….it all went down when he met my cousin my boyfriend saw her as everything he wanted  At first their interaction was decent they would joke around and all but little by little he started to act cute with her and be more touchy and he started to be cold with me he would ignore me too A year later I found out he was cheating on me with her  It was a hard hit that I took but I had to be strong I remember that back then I started to ignore him and he noticed so he would constantly ask for my attention  He started to ask if I was ok we had lots of fights just because I wanted to know if it was true and finally he called me 3 weeks ago and told me to break up with him  I asked why and he said that he was indeed cheating and he didn’t want to be hiding and doing it behind my back  I wanted to literally break his neck but I controlled my anger and agreed to break up  Just a message to girls who had this same thing  Just so you know NO BOY DESERVES YOUR TEARS ❤",

I was 25, finally let someone into my life for the first time, and I was quite naive to let him do the things he\u0027d done to me. In the end, I was mad at myself for tolerating his bullshit. It took me a whole year to fully recover, and never again am I ever going  through that twice. Staying single is the best choice. Don\u0027t chase. The one meant for you will come to you naturally, and you won\u0027t have to force anything. I\u0027m not looking for a relationship but a partnership, yes. So stay single until your partnership comes around. If not, that\u0027s fine too. I\u0027d rather be single than to be with a manipulative ass hole who can\u0027t be a man.

  "You broke me. First, last, you broke me every time you chose someone over me, a temporary high; a flirty glance, a secret meeting….you chose to be the very thing you claimed to hate- you decided sometime along the way, that I was not worth your love, your loyalty, your honesty, your kiss. Someday you will look back and see things clearly and know I was real, I was true to you. That your mistreatment of me, of my huge battered heart that whispered your name every second of every day, that you chose wrong. You chose darkness…temporary satisfaction, over true love. Over a heart that would have fought for you till it’s last and final breathe. I feel sad for you my love, for your future will be filled with the karma of these acts and you will never have the chance to feel the same.",

  "I wrote a song to my ex best friend  To my ex, best friend.  I present. Its not me it’s you. (Music)  I used to call you bestie,  my ride and my die,  but you’re not there when I’m dying.  This time,  You’re the cause of my dying.  You were. My partner in crime,  my 4lifer.  And most of all My best friend.  But this time, you’re not,  this time you are a stranger I don’t know.  A really horrible stranger who made me die. Because we both know how you make me cry,  told myself that you were right.  Put you up.  Put me down.  In order to make this work.  You pointed out my flaws, And I overlooked yours.  I just wanted someone who understood me.  finally I,  thought, you, were, “the one.” Then I saw who, you, really, were.  SOME OVER MELODRAMATIC BI  don’t know if the problem was me.  And believe me when i say, I say, I say ✨I’M TRYING TO CHANGE✨.  But this time it’s not me, it’s you.  This time it’s not me it’s you  Own it up,  take your ego out the fricking door  it’s not me it’s you.  It’s not me it’s you.  Suck up all your pride, and please,  just apologize. It’s time you say sorry for how you really hurt me. And I am still broken left in homeroom  it was 8: 52.  Running to my locker.  Breaking down on the floor  Did you ever care to say sorry?  Or even ask if I was okay?  If I was hurting? no.. because I’m the one who apologized.  For something you did.  It’s not new for me.  Super ordinary EVERY DAY, CRYING IN THE BATHROOM.  Thinking I messed this up  regretting every word I said, wanting to say sorry again for what?  You to say we’re still on pause?  I don’t want you anymore.  This is done AND ITS all your fault.  You fricked this up yourself.  So I still remember that day in gym you talked about my weight.  but then i was too blind to see.  You were really never sorry.  I SAID STUFF THAT DAY AND I REGRETED IT  BUT NOT THIS TIME.  NOT THIS TIME. You were really too toxic for me.  I thought I owed you the world for what?   you to say we’re still on PAUSE?  I don’t want you anymore.  This is done and it all your fault.  You fricked this up yourself.  I know we’re hurting maybe one more then the other, but even though I, used, to, say, sorry,  not this Time.  Not this time.  so just hope and wish I’ll come around.  Even though it’s not me it’s you.  Even though it’s not me it’s you.  Then i remember the day, you told me,  MY crush talks to you.  And we both know you did this on purpose.  Trying to make me hurt again.  Then I got angry.  Then I said sorry, all for what? You to say we’re still on pause?  I don’t want you anymore.  This is done AND ITS all your fault.  You fricked this up yourself.  But it’s not me it’s you But it’s not me it’s you  Hope you learn your lesson. :)",

Currently still dating after 2 years. About ready to propose soon and its so much harder than i thought. I hurt her,left and then came crawling back. I already spoke with her dad and mom who loved the idea and said theyll support everything from the ring to wedding financially and hugged me. Ive never been this nervous in my life. I know she doesnt see a proposal coming but has vaguely discussed them so i hope mine has her drop tears because shes earned every bit of that love because shes such a sweet heart to me when i was in my asshole phase.",

  "My boyfriend just cheated on me hours ago and coming back to this song…. Made me realize how relatable the lyrics are…I never wrote a comment before but expressing myself to unknown people on the internet brings a sense of relief that i could finally share it to someone. What would you guys do in my place ? I once told him that if he didn’t love me anymore he could have told me and I’d go away but instead decided to cheat on me. And the funny part is that i always forgave him for hurting me unintentionally or intentionally…. Sometimes i asked myself what crime did i commit to deserve such a life :) Wanna know what’s more funny when i asked him if he loved me or her… he said 75% me and 25% her and i told him if you loved me you’d never cheat on me and what’s more heartbreaking is that he just met that girl while we had over a year together",

We did, going through the guilt was very difficult, though a week later she sent me a few farewell messages to relieve the situation and I suggested trying again. We talked for two more days and I tried to get back to _all that we had,_ but she reminded me that I _broke her first,_ so it was no longer the same. The next day I tried to see where we stand, she broke down again, we spoke for a few more hours and decided to end it officially because we wouldn\u0027t be able to move on. That was yesterday. Today this song is on her story. I am no longer sad, just numb and lost.",

So Fact is without Jesus his SACRIFICE out of love for us we would all be lost! Only YHWH is not lying when he says he is HOLY and merciful! Who is YHWH equal? Exactly no one!! JESUS gave himself as a sin offering !! A pure life for a life !! Because we have to be holy \u003d without guilt otherwise God will judge us fair and just !! Jesus is YHWH and thus the Creator of everything and thus has the weight to wash the whole creation clean with these pure lives (Blood) !! God bless you",

  "I broke her. I tore her apart. I made her cry and now I am asking her to be with me again but it wasn\u0027t intentional. Feelings dissapears even if its love. Sometimes you gotta hold on to what you have and carry on with it but me, I didnt understand it cause I didnt know what love truely was. People miss things when they understand how valuable it is.  Thats what I felt as the time passed by. Yeah, I know I am in no place to curl back to her cause I dont deserve to, not after what I did to her but I cant carry on with this regression. There was never a day when I didnt think about what I did. There was never a day when I didnt notice her. There was never a day when I regreted my decision and there was never a day I didnt try to talk about it with her. I was bound by my guilt which never let me face her. Now, when I collected all my guilts and brought up that courage to tell her that I didnt ever stop loving her even though I left her making a harsh decision, I feel like I am doing it all wrong. She has moved on, she has her own life to deal with, own problems to solve and own things to fix I cant just go in and put all these words outa nowhere and create a disturbance in her life. So, I am trying my best to resist myself and suffer on my own cause I deserve this and she deserves someone better.",

  "When I broke up with my ex two years ago when I found out that he was using me and the whole relationship was a prank, I went mad. He told me to commit suicide and when I asked to meet up with him, he kept making excuses. My friends knew rhat something was off with him, but I refused to believe it. In July 2020, after three months together, that;s when I found out. I got a message saying that we should break up because he left his phone at his mate\u0027s house for three months. I said \"That\u0027s absolutely ridiculous!\" That\u0027s when I asked one of his mates, who told me that him and his mates were doing it for a prank. I messaged my \"boyfriend\" and broke up with him. I told him exactly what I thought of him and he got suspended at school because my friends took pictures of our conversations and showed it to the headteacher. When he went mad at me and said that I hurt him, I said \"I don\u0027t care how bad it hurts, because you broke me first!\"  Present day - We get along now. He came out as gay to me and I came out as Omnisexual and Non Binary to him. We don\u0027t talk about what happened that day anymore. We aren\u0027t exactly friends, but he\u0027s a much better person now. We graduated high school a couple of weeks ago. He\u0027s off to college and I\u0027m going to Sixth Form. We\u0027re going to keep in touch. I still haven\u0027t forgiven him for what he did, but I gave him a second chance, since he promised to change himself.",

My \"friends\" asked him Yes or no and He said he didnt want to answer... Suddenly he circled \"No\" We didnt talk much after that. He kept staring at me but i ignored him or made dirty faces at him. Our exams started soon after that, And ln the first day of exam we weng to separate classes due to pur role numbers. He was 12 and i was 4 as role numbers. At hometime, i saw him and he saw me... he looked at me like he never had before and i Looked at him for 2 seconds and then i roled my eyes and looked away. I felt sorry at first but i dont care how bad it hurts anymore, he broke me first and barely talks to me... He laughs around with his friends while im over here Devistated and heart broken. My friends ship us. Its quiet annoying because hes asking for it back now, i can relate so much. Listening to this song brought the memories back! I wish i could go back and say \"No i dont like him back\"",

Christian’s are not brainwashed, they are renewed. Romans 12:2 states “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind.”  It’s a DIFFERENT way of thinking that brings incredible changes in our lives. Changes we are not able to make on our own. Jesus Christ truly l❤️ves more than any other person could.",

  "This song made me tear up. My crush and me were everything. People shipped us and he asked me out. He was and is my everything. Thursday he said some girl asked him out and he gave her his number and im hurt but I still love him and ik he still loves me because even if I said I didn\u0027t want to talk to him because of jealousy he still looks at me alot knowing im hurting. Should I talk to him again?",
  "ask to look at they\u0027re texts, its not too far asking to look thru the texts. If hes still talking to her and flirting and stuff, pls leave. That\u0027s toxic, but if he\u0027s willing to have a clean start and block the other girl, or just become friends with her, get back with him! Remember to keep your eyes out still and be aware of what could happen again though! I wish you the best xoxo",
