  "This song always reminds me of when I was in APUSH after Trump first got elected (we were talking about his policies and how it\u0027ll affect the country and how it relates to previous administrations), and I was crying because I was extremely upset about what he might do. I mentioned that I was worried that he might try and force me out of my home and put me in a camp simply because I\u0027m Native American (my specific tribe is very small and experiences lots of racism, even amongst other tribes). I wonder how my teacher and classmates feel when they also think of me crying that day and worrying about something they told me would never happen. For those who don\u0027t know, Native Americans are being targeted by the Trump administration. They are trying to pass a law that would overturn a 1924 law that made Native Americans legal citizens of the US. Since his inauguration ICE agents have been harassing Natives leaving reservations by asking for papers and trying to detain and arrest them.  With his aggressive anti-immigration laws and policies (sending (read: selling) those who can\u0027t be sent back to their home country to camps in other countries to be used as a labor force or sent to Guantanamo Bay (yes, the same one they use to torture suspected and convicted terrorists. The camp there is labeled as \u0027temporary\u0027, which given its bloodied history can easily like it to be a death camp in the making). Seeing as Native Americans are from North America and the administration\u0027s goal is to send (read: sell to El Salvador) out all illegal people in the country, where would we be sent? All five million plus Native Americans? What would happen to our land, the land that oil, logging, construction, and mining companies have been itching to get their hands on?  For anyone whose read this far and still doesn\u0027t believe me, there has already been multiple cases of legal citizens, and even veterans, being illegally detained by ICE, and in one notable case (Davino Watson), was essentially held hostage by ICE for three years and can\u0027t sue due to a legal loophole that ICE knowingly used against him. They don\u0027t care if you\u0027re actually a legal citizen or not, they care about if you look like one. All of this is for me to say to those who never thought that the Trump administration would do something so rancid, blatantly illegal, and fundamentally against human rights; are you ashamed for not seeing the writing on the wall as I, a then 16 year old, did?",

Spain claimed my death when I took the Northern route to return the hinde and left with another fleet by way of the Northern route to nova Albion.nit being seen by Spain below the equator. She forever says I’m a pirate to Spain.  1605 gunpowder treason and plot  With the colonist deceived by the French and the Spanish in the Caribbean, they were never able to reach Bay of Drake on the other side of Panama or me at nova Albion where they had representation and so believed they were not represented in the new world as they were certain they were in the right place… (that part in The declaration where they are upset about the meeting place that they cannot reach) after listening to the French obscuring Drake with France is great and incorrect navigation from Spaniards .. (how they say Columbus of Spain for getting lost in what Spain believed was India from the other way)… It would have been so easy Had James town done their job,  And landed near the second peninsula the Yucatán… and got to bay of Drake, the French would gave been denied Louisiana and the outlawing of slavery by nova Albion would have extended the entire expanse of Drake’s land… the slave trade by the Spanish and Portuguese traders at Brazil of Africans to the Caribbean would have been completely denied in the new world… instead with the French at Louisiana encouraging the worse of the colonist in the south east and Spain maintained a constant shipments of slaves among regular merchant ships to the Caribbean . Drake as the only royal privateer in History embarked on a campaign of piracy freeing slaves and undermining Spains empire on his land. While also batting Spain by land at nova Albion  and all around and denying passage to the French and Spanish at the north and the south to the far side of the new world by sea. The entire age of piracy…  1800 the French revolution begins, a boat… 1803 The French are expelled from the west and on the back end of their losing war to California they sell land they didn’t own to the deceived east  Who knew nothing of California or Mexico other then the narrative Philipiii had approved… Slavery is now officially outlawed in Spains empire by Drake as always intended  1815 Spain and Portugal’s African slave trade is abolished by the crown…  1820  Everything annexed from Spain no slaves all the way to Antarctica…  1821  Spain CEDES Florida to the east, as it’s south of nova California … Spain maintains their narrative of Mexico to the east… without me without nova Albion, with out the fleets  Mexico American war… I’ve already defeated Spain… Baja Waving the burning flag of Spains empire… and they get there after relegitimizing the entire remnants of Spain fighting across under the impression of Spains narrative,  and go we know we beat Mexico we made it to California……………….. Gold rush, … Literally no slaves on that side… Mike G is a piece of sht, and all that bs is wrong…Spains empire never would have fallen and that would still be happening like that… because then There really was no one else and it would have been Louisiana Mexico all the way up … to Alaska completely unchecked Nixion tripping the satellite image and being a dumb ass in his 70’s hotel room thinking he owns the trade routes….and can exploit the advantage space age media… Yeah Waldo shot that sht down from within the military  Nixion did what trumps doing with gallo but not nearly as pathetic as his identity crisis thing… or the wanting to be nobility thing … Donny ducky doesn’t know who his 1800 Daddy is …. And he’s got little Mikey complex …  what’s gonna happen when everyone remembers there was no slavery for nearly 300yr in America and it’s been hidden from history so Spain can hide it fleets of Portuguese and Spanish slavers and look for another way around …  And because the Donny’s want the kingship and nobility for a monopoly …  As literal they would only want the Canal I could approve so they could use it , but not the land because I own it…  And they not care about mine up in Canada …because I own it and they can’t… and that’s kinda why we’re it’s still just starting… they aren’t even to the beginning at bay of Drake yet or even around the world …  We straight up regressed to flat earth for a while… and they went dark ages with the hollow crap… We could literally do the  Johnny Rico… Buenos Aires bit…like now instead of deportations… And then What’s brazils full slaver history ….  That’s all Portugal there …and the entire network.. Brazil to Africa to the Caribbean,then the French say they’re English… Luisiana",

Sad. “Don’t catch you slippin up,”…….don’t act “white”…..as if yt people are the gatekeepers of goodness. Last I checked, that was God.

How about Johnny Somali in Asia? A promoter of peace and order, that one! 😆  And to think, around when this song came out I definitely had more empathy and sympathy. Now, after the past 9 years of experience here, I\u0027ve realized just how much Oscar the Grouch is superior to these garbage individuals who cherry pick stories and cases to support... what exactly? Black Lives Matter? That was horse sh*t. If you see the world in that way, you\u0027d better change or off yourself, as you\u0027re disconnected from sense. Good lives matter. Good people matter. Those aligned with good matter. Not black. Not white. Not Asian. Not Latino. No superficial trait.  The weak of mind and uneducated attempt to sway the weak of mind and uneducated regarding sense. Brilliant! Good thing we\u0027re good at making lemons into lemonade. That is, if your social credit score calculated over the last 9 years alone shows you to be a garbage person, it will double red flag you. If you\u0027ve a double red flag, your children will have a red flag until at minimum 25, and then, should they be decent, they will be accepted, but will not be allowed to live, go to school, or work various jobs and for various companies regardless of their seeming intelligence.

Then like 5 minutes later they start fighting again and the one bigger guy is over top of the other beating his face in, a crowd had formed around them and I was at the front. Then out of  nowhere a third hooded guy shows up and shoots the big guy right in his back. We all started running and I remember never being so afraid for my life. Then when I\u0027m out of the subway I see an older white guy panting next to me and he looks at me and says, \"what the f*ck is wrong with people?\" And I just shrugged and said, \"this is america\".

This is a tell tale to people just loving Hip Hop but completely ignoring the violence against the very same people the music is enriching off of. Kinda reminds you of the song when Andre 3000 “y’all just want to dance” Also, those uniforms by the students. I haven’t seen US students wearing those uniforms but you know which country’s students wear them? South Africa and what is known about South Africa in terms of racial discrimination and hate? Apartheid.  Another thing is that Black and Red coloration for the choir is no hiccup but the more interesting part is why take the green out and replace it with white? Much to think on.",

  "I searched for \"does rap music make you dumber\" and this was the first thing I saw... People don\u0027t understand three important things about the industry. 1) It\u0027s actually a living entity. 2)It has intent and is very effective at what it does. And 3)Much like these social media platforms and entertainment mechanisms, it\u0027s all controlled by the same entities that cause you to not only feel you need to consume this garbage but makes sure you enjoy it. Now before someone pictures me as some entitled kid who grew up in the \"upper class\" suburbs, I\u0027m going to say straight up that I grew up in the very areas that are targeted by these same people who put us there in the first place. Liberty City in the heart of places people were told to avoid in Miami, opa-locka where the concept of a \"trap\" was even thought up etc. I\u0027ve been around since break dancing, listening to all this incoherent garbage from Africa bambata, e.p.m.d, scarface and the ghetto boys, sissy ass tpac and soft ass biggie, black rob, Busta, bone thugs, you name it. Very few gave an actual message that inspired thought like immoral technique and even he got some shit wrong because he believes the history he was told. I\u0027m in my 50\u0027s now and it bothers me that an idiot rapping about having lean in his cup and gas in his tank like it\u0027s some kind of life achievement actually gets people to bob and dance to this mind numbing garbage. People, please pull your heads out of your asses,  wake up and open your eyes and minds. And I mean wake up as to become conscious not \"woke\" and do what you think people want youbto do. There isn\u0027t anything wrong with being an individual. One person can out think a \"collective\" of brain dead robots in the first 2 seconds of rolling out of bed. How much brain power can YOU use?... I hope young people read this and see that these people you idolize are phony as a three dollar bill. Rapping about robbing, slinging dope, doing time and all the things they\u0027ve never experienced in reality. It all comes from the mind of some industry goon in a suit writing their lyrics for them.",

Meanwhile all this stuff is going on. This is how typical Americans are. Only worried about material over real-world stuff that goes on. The song also starts with \"we just want the money we just want to party. Party just for me.\" 5) peaceful people are dying and it\u0027s being covered up 6) complete chaos  7) he says \"this a celly\" then shows kids hanging around and dancing. schools are little prisons. Black Kids Set up for failure kind of thing.  8) in the end it will lead to an apocalypse hence why the cars are scattered in a disarray like they\u0027ve just been abandoned and no one actually cares  9) \"on my Kodak\" \u003d everyone\u0027s drugged out 10) but I mean hey as long as the kids can dance and you\u0027re pretty who cares?",

  "Interesting thing to note... I fell away from rap music after gangster rap turned into this explosion of glorifying the horrors of the hood and the degradation of black women. God Bless 80s and 90s Hip Hop. Could there be a return to the glory of hip hop with Kendrick? BUT... Gonna be real with you all... I\u0027m hard of hearing... As is an 82 year old lady whose dog I walk... She actually watched the Superbowl (I did not) and reported the performance was very well choreographed but did NOT understand anything Lamar actually SAID!  As a member of the hearing loss community, I can appreciate how hard it can be to receive a \"message\" that you cannot hear? 🤔 The visuals were great and I imagine Kendrick (not knowing any of his music) was rapping some very profound words. However, most old white Americans (aka a good chunk of the Superbowl) are NOT familiar with hip hop and CANNOT appreciate what he is actually saying due to poor hearing ability! What a difference it might have made if Lamar has found a way to make sure his words were received LOUD and CLEAR... Subtitles on the tv at least? Have a screen up that shows the lyrics for those in the audience? Can\u0027t fault people for not being literally unable to hear! Break that \"sound barrier\" and the Super Bowl would have slayed.",

  "Not enough people talk about how damaging the fake “white cops kill black people” narrative (which this video at least partly eludes to) was.  Stories that fit that narrative were cherry picked and brought to the masses, causing a snowball affect of confirmation bias that this was an exclusively white on black phenomenon. I remember people gradually quit thinking critically about what actually happened in those police killings because they saw the explicitly white on black trend as evidence enough of that white cops just like killing blacks.  It\u0027s a very destructive narrative because even if a neutral observation of all police shooting would show that it happens disproportionately to blacks (idk if it does or doesn\u0027t), that\u0027s a mile away from \"it only happens to blacks\". The George Floyd summer would probably not have happened (or at least be tolerated) if people like Tony Timpa had equal coverage.",

  "On January 20th, 2025, Donald J. Trump was inaugurated as 47th President of the United States of America. Since then, a series of shocking events have occurred in a matter of 14 days since his inauguration (as of February 2nd, 2025). Trump claimed he had no association with the Project 2025 Mandate for Leadership manifesto, and yet a majority of his initial Executive Orders and actions as President over the last two weeks directly correlate to the contents within the manifesto. The actions of this administration since its conception in 2016, and more notably as of 2025, are directly congruous with Fascist ideology, alluding to the dangers of Donald Trump, and the agenda he is currently enacting. Capitalism is in decline in the United States, marked by rampant cronyism, corruption, oligarchy, social unrest, extreme polarization, massive wealth inequality, an undermined working class, erosion of democracy, a rampant housing crisis, and inflation. The United States of America is reaching a critical point in its history.",

  "Nice song but…… One plus one is a fundamental mathematical operation known as addition. Specifically, it involves combining two single-unit quantities into a single group. In numerical terms, the operation is expressed as 1 + 1. When you add one to another one, the result is two, which can be represented numerically as \"2\". This operation is often one of the first arithmetic concepts taught in early education due to its simplicity and foundational role in more complex mathematical concepts. Visualizing one plus one can be as simple as imagining two individual apples being placed together in a basket; if you start with one apple and add another, you end up with two apples total. This concept applies universally across objects and scenarios. The principle of one plus one extends beyond numbers alone; it can be seen in various real-life applications. For example, combining one person with another person results in a pair. In essence, the idea of one plus one is a building block for understanding how quantities combine and grow, offering a straightforward yet crucial insight into the world of mathematics and arithmetic operations.",

  "Week 1 of the Trump administration: 1) Widespread ICE raids and deportations, except they\u0027re deporting Americans, including Native Americans and Hispanics who have been here generations. 2) Trump froze ALL federal grant payments, including for higher education, special education, food aid, medical research, and other vital services. States like Washington are suing and demanding that he release payments-which have already been allocated and approved by Congress. 3) The press secretary announced that egg prices are high because the previous admin. allowed widespread culling of herds due to bird flu. Their plan is to ignore bird flu and allow flu-ridden eggs to poison the human food supply, threatening public health. 4) The press secretary announced that birthright citizenship is out of step with the Trump administration\u0027s legal framework and out of step with the constitution-even though it\u0027s LITERALLY IN THE CONSTITUTION. 5) Sam Altman and Elon Musk are fighting over who gets the AI infrastructure contracts. Low-key rumors that AI infrastructure means Neurolink for everyone, against our will, along with ubiquituous surveillance. 6) Pete Hegseth was appointed SecDef, despite being the most unqualified perhaps in American history. 7)Kristi Noem, the new Homeland Security Sec., walked out on her first day on the job to the country song, \"Hot Mama\" before going on an ICE raid to \"catch dirtbags\". This is America. 1/28/2025 Help me keep it up to date.",

Notice how they keep saying \"tell somebody\" - the guitar player started to and was killed before he got an audience. the choir started to and was killed before they got an audience.  then in the end of the video the uncle toms are running...... whatver the establishment decides to do with them, there will come more of our own to enforce the establishments wishes against us.",

  "As a white man brought up in the school system in CT which is considered to this day separatist, no one knew we were being fashioned racists. The black community was introduced to white people over 8 channels of projected tragedy as entertainment. The kids I grew up around were told a very different tale regarding history. Christopher Columbus, as if there isn\u0027t a halo around a person who committed genocide against a peaceful group of people in the name of greed now has a scribble on the relevance of \"Columbus Day\" being insultingly entangled to a day respecting him and the people he erased isn\u0027t enough to realize history is in the opinion and property of its owners.   Many of us were raised racist without knowing it. Lincoln didn\u0027t end slavery for the respect of humans being human it was an economic move. ...I grew up a white boy but later lived in cities where the population was not familiar and already had experience with a racism I didn\u0027t know and a sledgehammer of reality hit quickly. The division is on both sides. \"Get that money, black man\" is a cavalcade that includes white people. We are all a part of the corporation competition called Different Countries. On a global scale it\u0027s easier to apply economics to the competition that creates wars. Pride in our countries has merit, don\u0027t get me wrong but it\u0027s essentially faith or reliance or blind belief that the governing body keeps us in a comfy spot.  Yes a difference between us can be a disconcerting thing but it\u0027s far more encouraged then the children we were understanding became part of us as adults.",

Now, at the age of 23, rewatching this before the 2024 general election... I realize that this video is about the hypocrisy of consuming Black culture (which we all do to some extent through our media), giving superficial nods to Black artists who graciously expose us to their culture, and then us doing absolutely NOTHING to change the systemic brutalization of Black people. I\u0027m grateful to all of the perspectives I\u0027ve encountered that have helped me understand, even just a little bit, about how important it is to pay attention to things like this, and vote in a way that benefits us all, not just me.",

He is music has always been fantastic and I always love him in the show Community and his sense of humor. It was really cool to also see him make the jump to Star Wars in 2018 in the movie Solo👏🏿.

For African Americans it seems their only options to achieve success financially have been primarily been: entertainment or violent drug culture. Shown in the music, laws, and social events of American history. Like at the end when he danced on the car- those were Micheal Jackson moves. This song and video are representing the hypocrisy in American culture towards people of African descent. America is what it is, and should aim to be better than it’s past by correct and improving its present. It shows how under valued and oppressed this group of Americans- the struggle they have over their white counterparts to obtain the same job and same financial security. The desperation is real- and it shows itself through violent drug culture plaguing their descendants. And this IS America. Sad but all too true.",

They kill the good people who want to get us out of the distraction trans (the church ppl saying black man get ur money/the peaceful man playing guitar) they want us to live in chaos. At the end of the video you see him running for his life, and that’s because he warned us and woke up the black community from this trans. Stay up my kings and queens, for they want to destroy our community and a lot of us are still taking the bait. Stay educated, keep stacking and investing for a better lifestyle.

I love the United States  - my entire life I have loved her potential and what I thought she could be one day.  But on Jan 6, and for months and years afterwards, I have seen the people of the USA act like a bunch of idiotic morons who don\u0027t care about the health of their citizens, the education of their citizens, or the United States\u0027 place within the world.  When I was young, people in the United States wanted good roads, a strong middle class, and as many opportunities for as many Americans as possible.  There is no reason the United States could not be the greatest and most successful country in the world.  But people, for some reason, don\u0027t want to make a single move to make things better or even decent for Americans.   I hope I never go back to the USA.  It\u0027s just too sad.",

But the lyrics and song itself is super bland, and if you took away everything you\u0027re seeing and just had the song itself, it wouldn\u0027t be that great. So *in my opinion* I don\u0027t like the song. Feel free to form your own opinion. This Is America, and you have the right to your own opinion ❤",

  "Trying to crack the code on this video on 4/24/24  I believe the meaning is In the beginning before the gunshot- it’s what we want truly in our country  After the gunshot He’s saying this is America  Like what you see is America  “I’m so cold like yeah” small phrases of the sort like that and “look what I’m whipping tho, I’m on Gucci, I’m so pretty” are things that drive us in this country we focus on these things instead of what we originally wanted like “we” said in the beginning of the video. The chaos is what is also going on that are traumatic asf but we ignore it with our what…”celly” double meanin, but “celly” distracts you from everything and black man just get your money  While running young thug is saying the black man just wanted money and material but now he’s running for his life from America.",

  "something i just noticed about this video is that when Donald shoots the guy in the chair and the choir both times he does it seemingly out of nowhere, and gives momentary if any reaction to what just happened. we portray shooters in America as mentally ill, and they often portray themselves in the same way, but this is after whatever they did; they\u0027re trying to save face and get a reduced sentence. The fact is that shooters are \"so cold\", psychopathic and thus have an inappropriate emotional reaction to their deeds, if any. also, shootings or killings where the killer is hateful or where it is a mass event are more publicly derided than violence on an even more massive scale like the attacks on palastine, and also the many many unpublicized acts of violence that happen over stupid petty shit, arguements and jelousy, or just literarly because someone wanted to kill. the guy that would shoot the guy in the chair is the kind of guy who would also go on dancing like nothing happened",

At the very ed you see people running, they are running from the darkness of America because there are just so much dark and hidden things in America. Then when the church people singing this is a true story a white man came in a back church and shot everyone in there. then when he making a gun with fingers and his eyes closed, that means people just shoot anything human\u0027s, animals, anything for no absolute reason.

This is a lame ass beat, a mediocre hook that repeats too often and for too long, and a couple of D- grade bars that don\u0027t tell any kind of story, let alone a good or interesting one about \"what America is\" from his perspective.

Derek chauvin\u0027s bodycam shows he is on his shoulder blade and proven accurate by the angle of the famous video. The only reason derek chauvin was even charged was because of the riots and they knew the US would burn if he was not convicted) and instead of coming together and dealing with the issue of police brutality, half of the nation decided to self sabotage and burn cities to the ground... for nothing... loot communities who were black supported and run, burned down family ran stores that have nothing to do with anything, 19 children died during the duration of the riots, CHAZ.... an actual embarrassment to americans as a whole, instead of coming together we torn eachother apart.",

  "One way of interpreting the video I guess is, that the way Gambino dances and sings about self centred and superficial things like his looks and how cool he is, while surrounded by gun violence, riots, and growing chaos, is basically a metaphor for how American culture focuses on superficial things while ignoring it\u0027s own collapse happening in the background. There\u0027s obviously a call out to gun violence, and the lyrics like \u0027Grandma told me get yo money, Black man (get yo money)\u0027 possibly pointing out how for many in the US, they\u0027re taught from an early age to just focus on themselves and surviving, getting money, often by any means. A lot of I guess you could say the lyrics also reference a lot of gangsta rap style lyrics where rappers pretend to be gangstas and boast about how \u0027bad\u0027 they are, and basically makes a mockery of how there\u0027s almost a bizarre sense of pride among those who have learnt to survive in a system that is obviously broken.

  "Childish Gambino made a simply incredible video. It would seem at first glance that this is an absolutely ordinary clip. But what Childish did, he didn’t just release an aggressive video with crazy energy, but he showed at the beginning when the choir sings, elements of the church decent life of Americans who can talk all week about world problems, elections in the USA, payments, terrorism, crime, drug dens and brothels - and on Sunday you can immediately forget about it and atone for your sins, putting on rose-colored glasses. After this, we see the whole negative side of American society, and its greed, cruelty, corruption and all the dirt that the American government is so carefully trying to hide from its citizens. So bravo to Childish Gambino for such a strong, realistic picture of life in America.",

  "Hello ! May Allah protect and guide you to his light and happiness in this life and the hereafter, God bless, Ameen. Excuse me for giving a little presentation of Islam, because it is very misunderstood nowadays, especially on those « Antichrist\u0027s » times, where media and politics are mixed to distort history and truth. Thank you very much for your time. First of all, if you have any questions regarding Islam and yourself, just open the Quran randomly, and you will find the answer in front of you, like a miracle and a sign from God. \t Islam is an arabic word that means the Surrender to the One and Only God, our Creator, Protector, Provider, who gives us life and all that we have, we are safe and sound by his will and grace, we are His and to Him we return, and we have to thank him in this trial life by submitting to him by our free will, or later in the Day of judgment when it\u0027s too late to save our own skin. Islam was the original Religion descended to earth from heaven with Adam and Eve (peace and blessing be upon them) in the beginning of humanity. and was passed to people with the succession of the 124 000 prophets and 315 messengers of God to all nations and civilizations since, passing by Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Ismaël, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, David, Solomon and Jesus (Peace and blessing be upon them) during the history of mankind, the last replaces and completes the previous, until the succession of the last messenger of God fourteen centuries ago, Muhammad (Peace and blessing be upon him) to complete the noble morals of all mankind, to bring humans and jinns out of darkness into light, and to purify people\u0027s religion and belief from corruption and polytheism, and return it to purity and true monotheism, like it was in the times of the prophets (Peace and blessing be upon them). Many Religions that we know nowadays, at their beginning were true and under Islam, initiated by one of the prophets of God, but their original teachings, history and scriptures have been corrupted over time with falsification and polytheism, or lost and replaced with false ones. That\u0027s why Islam is the only Religion accepted by God nowadays, which consists in bearing witness that there is no god besides Allah (God in Aramaic, the original language of Jesus and the Gospel), and that Muhammad is His servant and messenger, just like Jesus and Moses and others are His servants and messengers. Never a messenger of God said he was God or literally son of God, it was the people after him who changed the words of God and corrupted the Religion. God is unique and absolute, He does not need to have a family and sons or to associate anyone else with His kingdom, He can simply create whatever He wants, everything belongs to Him, and to Him everything will return. Allah said in Surah Al-Mu’minun : “God has never begotten a son, nor is there any god besides Him. Otherwise, each god would have taken away what it has created, and some of them would have gained supremacy over others. Glory be to God, far beyond what they describe. The Knower of the hidden and the manifest. He is exalted, far above what they associate. (91-92 / Translated by ITANI). Allah means the one and only God, the God of all prophets and creatures, the creator of the universe and mankind, and the Master of the Day of judgment, where our destiny, Hell or Paradise, is decided based on our faith and deeds in this trial life, and above all, Allah\u0027s mercy.  Allah said in Surah Al-Ikhlas : In the name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful. Say, “He is God, the One. God, the Absolute. He begets not, nor was He begotten. And there is none comparable to Him.” (1-4 / Translated by ITANI). Allah said in Surah An-Nisa : O FOLLOWERS of the Gospel! Do not overstep the bounds [of truth] in your religious beliefs, and do not say of God anything but the truth. The Christ Jesus, son of Mary, was but God\u0027s Apostle - [the fulfilment of] His promise which He had conveyed unto Mary - and a soul created by Him. Believe, then, in God and His apostles, and do not say, \"[God is] a trinity\". Desist [from this assertion] for your own good. God is but One God; utterly remote is He, in His glory, from having a son: unto Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth; and none is as worthy of trust as God. Never did the Christ feel too proud to be God\u0027s servant, nor do the angels who are near unto Him. And those who feel too proud to serve Him and glory in their arrogance [should know that on Judgment Day] He will gather them all unto Himself: (171-172 / Translated by Muhammad Asad). Allah the Most Merciful said in Surah Ali-Imran : Behold, the only [true] religion in the sight of God is [man\u0027s] self-surrender unto Him; and those who were vouchsafed revelation aforetime took, out of mutual jealousy, to divergent views [on this point] only after knowledge [thereof] had come unto them. But as for him who denies the truth of God\u0027s messages - behold, God is swift in reckoning! Thus, [O Prophet,] if they argue with thee, say, \"I have surrendered my whole being unto God, and [so have] all who follow me!\" - and ask those who have been vouchsafed revelation aforetime, as well as all unlettered people, \"Have you [too] surrendered yourselves unto Him?\" And if they surrender themselves unto Him, they are on the right path; but if they turn away - behold, thy duty is no more than to deliver the message: for God sees all that is in [the hearts of] His creatures. Verily, as for those who deny the truth of God\u0027s messages, and slay the prophets against all right, and slay people who enjoin equity - announce unto them a grievous chastisement. It is they whose works shall come to nought both in this world and in the life to come; and they shall have none to succour them. (19-22 / Translated by Muhammad Asad).. God said : Say, “We believe in Allah, and in what was revealed to us, and in what was revealed to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs, and in what was given to Moses and Jesus, and in what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We do not differentiate between any of them. And to Him, we surrender.” (2:136 / Translated by Community) Salam (Peace)",

Also this song is amazing the message is really helpful and truthful about America and women and black black men and the treatment they face from white men and the beat is amazing.

  "I come here at least five times throughout a year. I know that racism has been around as long as the White Man has been around and it extends much farther worldwide than just the references in this video (POC in the USA today and in history) but the overall message of it can speak for any race besides White, as every single one has been met with horror inflicted upon them by White Supremacy in some form, at some time. It’s such a heavy and powerful story told over and over again, the White Man arrives somewhere outside of the European Continent (or pays others already deeply affected by their oppression) and meets a culture with no kindness, no peace. Only righteousness and aggression. Takes control of a culture and people simply living their lives, and destroys, displaces and exploits it in every single possible way. Of course it still happens today, as this video wouldn’t be as heavy without its modern presence. White people can shelter, segregate and hide from the reality of the world all they want, make up thousands of excuses and illegitimacy how it didn’t happen, or it did happen but no longer happens, or denies facets of it that are actively happening today. But reality is not what they believe in. This hits me extra hard because it has been five years since this song and video was released, and not a damn thing has changed for the better. If 1 does, then there’s another 10 against it. In the United States of America, politics could improve suffering of marginalized communities. It also holds it in place, and with far right ideologies taking the main stage and of the government and many of its people since 2016, a lot of hope for progress has been diminished. At least for another looong time. The Internet, expanding and social media continuously growing, is both a blessing and a curse. It scares me to think that we didn’t realize how just as much connection and information is positively being used, it’s being used nefariously. White Supremacy is a very large prevalent example. Time will only tell if we will look back on the first three decades of this millennia and still be suffering equally or worse, or be able to reflect in a different, darker time. 🤍",

In 4 years i moved 26 times. Defamation of character and harassment of my friends was employed to isolate me. What y\u0027all need to know is YHWH is King of everything. He sent His Son as a helpless baby, and placed ALL our indiscretions and cruelties on that Boy to achieve The Final Judgment against all human ills. \"The Man\" could not stop me. They hurt me but never broke me. God bless Julian and Edward. Listen to Javier Milei - he is our future: \"Afuera‼️\"",

  "For anyone wondering this song is about how screwed and corrupt the justice system is. The lyrics and music video directly references an incident that happened 2018 in sacramento (at least I think it was there, I may be wrong on that) where an innocent black man was shot in the back by a police officer multiple times because there had been some crime that a black man committed in the area, so when the officer saw a black man (from the back mind you) he immediately assumed he was the criminal. Then he saw the man holding a phone which the officer assumed was a weapon (🙄 like what, how is a phone anything like a gun). After this the family and honestly the whole country tried to get justice but the sacramento police department refused to convict him saying that it was an honest mistake.  After all of this came out this song came out which brought millions of eyes onto the chase which made everyone think that they the sacramento police department would be forced to do something. So you know what they did… absolutely nothing! Like what! Justice has still not been served 😔",

The kids cant tell nobody anything bc what if the adults gets arrested, theyll be the one to blame, they could get shot for being a snitch, they might get opps, they might get taken away, and they might live with the never ending guilt yk and so they forget about it and tries to have a normal childhood, now the kids are dancing and having fun while doing cartwheels at 1:08 but it keeps happening again the adults around them keeps exposing them to the more danger of this world leaving them being even more and more traumatized, they cant ignore it now maybe and then they start using guns, wearing masks, and all the stuff, the trauma changed who they are as a person at 2:27 now the kids are dancing again and having fun but theyre still traumatized and the way of coping ig is to think theyre being lit by saying and thinking guns are lit and that they shoot they opps and stuff and they got a gun at home or smth like as if theyre danger and always in danger as a hype thing to be cool and dancing just to cope with the trauma ig at 2:33 then when the kids are actually in danger because a kid or adult took the “we lit we in gangs we dis we dat blat blat we shootin up the school cuz we got opps here blah blah blah“ persona a lil too far where now theyre ACTUALLY in danger so now theyre running for their lives and everyone fears the shooter, the shooter is just hurt and made their life even worse, but to just cope with their sadness, trauma and childhood being ruined from even being born into this traumatiz generational curse trauma, but to continue to cope they smoke a cig or wtv with a nonchalant persona and goes along their day, the full cirlcle are constantly being a sad black person and finally understanding the circle at 2:43 Okay ik im a nerd LOL XD but this is just me making up stories XDD",

He illustrates his skill so well that I believe it proves his message, It feels like I stumbled along a road in the dark and ended up exactly where he expected I would.

  "I remember turning 21, having just moved to DC for work, and this song coming out.  I was in the place I dreamed of living since my youth when this song came out. We had a tyrannical inflammatory President at the time. Every week if I was traveling for work there was a shooting or police brutality in the news, often somewhere nearby while traveling for work. Money was flowing because regulators were replaced by people like Ajit Pai who worked for Verizon and then became chairman of the FCC. There is an insane amount of corrupted and lobbied politics that occurred for years. Crypto scams and ideas that made no sense. This song for me is as to Trumps Presidency as was \"Fortunate Son\" by Creedance Clearwater was to the Vietnam war. I\u0027ll even add that people were so scared that American Horror Story made a season about extremist cults dedicated to the president at the time, since political voting parties were so polarized they seemed extreme from the outside. On January 4-6 racists gathered within 20 minutes of my house at the time and I had to tell my girlfriend not to leave the house since racists were in the hotels nearby and causing scenes where they went. On January 6 there was an actual riot at the Whitehouse as most of us know. When life imitates art. Riots with police/police brutality occurred in Portland Oregon.  I remember the statues being taken down from Richmond VA after BLM riots occured there as well, driving through and seeing the statue\u0027s bases spray painted over. Events like George Floyd and so many more following. This music video reminds me of all of it. I still have a mug that says \"literally anyone sane 2020\" and I remember seeing the same slogan in Pittsburgh on banners outside of houses. When I was in my sophomore year of Highschool roughly I remember someone drove a dodge Challenger through a peaceful protest in Charlottesville VA, and after that I never wanted a Dodge Challenger ever again. Then later in my life when I was in that DC area I visited Charlottesville and there were Nazi tattooed skinheads begging for money and it was the first time I had ever seen someone so openly racist. It gave my chills up through my spine like \"we have to get out of here\" and it was shocking to see such bold display of insanity. Watching it go full circle was shocking coming from small towns where I never really met a real racist.",

  "This should be a wake-up call if you don\u0027t already know this... A recent poll was conducted by a national polling outfit. Names don\u0027t matter. They are all the same. This one was \"YouGov.\" Results to these questions asked of average people on the street:   1.  What percentage of the country is black?  Answers - 41%...  Actual 13%.  If you watch TV commercials, you would think it is 90%.   2.  What percentage of marriages are mixed race? Answers 50%...  Actual 1%. If you watch commercials, you would think it is 90%.   3.  What percentage is \"Latino\"?  Answers 39%...  Actual 17%.    4.  How many families make more than $500,000 a year?  Answers 26%...  Actual figure 1%.  We think a quarter of the country is rich.    5.  What percent of Americans are vegetarians?  Response? 30%...  Actual 5%.   6.  What percent of Americans live in New York City?  Answers? 30%...  Actual 3%.    7.  What percentage of Americans are \u0027transgender? Answers 22%...  Actual number .5% (that is POINT 5)    So why do people have such inaccurate thoughts on these counts? THE MEDIA! The media runs race, gender, and wealth stories constantly. Result? You are being brainwashed by the national left with the media. Hitler\u0027s propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels would be proud if he had half the success.   Disney just went full-on \"gender.\" It will no longer welcome guests with the traditional \"Welcome ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.\" Why? Because .5% of the population dictates to the other 99% (that would be the vast majority), and corporate America falls for it.   Regardless of what you think, less than 20% of Americans use \"Twitter,\" yet Twitter controls 80% of public opinion. Why? Because the media is so effective at what it does. It promotes as well as censors. Think about it.   Next time you are thinking Americans have changed and not in a good way, remember, it\u0027s mostly fake. It\u0027s all a lie. Most people think just like you do but the media has brainwashed Americans with constant broadcasting of LIES.    It\u0027s called social engineering. It\u0027s here and it\u0027s effective😊",

They don\u0027t care about you, being incarcerated, or obliterated or murdered and paying you to off each other.  This was a WAKE up call  for you all!   Remember that YOU are the enemy of society if you are not rich, and not on their drugs making them money, and buying up guns and harming each other.  WE are the GENERATIONS of the future and we need to STOP them by NOT VOTING FOR REPUBLICANS or ANYONE for the NRA again.  Innocent kids are being murdered in mass shootings, guns in the poorest of neighborhoods,  corruption in Government and corrupt police using you!  Learn your lesson and get these creeps out of our congress!  You are the Generation that can overcome all of this and stop the madness.  I appreciate Donald Glover even more because of this song and opening eyes like he did with it.

I couldn\u0027t believe how hard-hitting and powerful the film was. Incredible. I sat and thought about it for an hour before I dared to watch it again. And second time around it was just as powerful, and you can catch some of the subtlety situated in between the immediately shocking. Seems to me this is what happens when a black man lets his genius off the leash. If I use this film in my class, it could be enough to end of my career. That\u0027s what makes it so brilliant and why I must use it. Thank you for challenging us and forcing us to look in the mirror.",

  "La verdad, después de 5 años ya desde esta canción, me doy cuenta de que este artista solo nos mostró lo que se vendría, tal como una profecía o quizás, como lo que claramente iba y seguirá pasando, esta canción tiene todos los significados que la gente le da, porque de eso se trata la canción, desde el tema del racismo y sus guiños en la actuación y muecas, hasta en la sociedad actual en donde te tienen cegado con la diversión, los lujos, la belleza, pero la realidad es mucho mas cruda, hoy en día en internet vemos vidas de artistas y de personas en donde todo es lujo y excentricidades, te dicen que debes ser productivo, que debes comprar, comprar, consumir, gastar, porque de lo contrario no estarás al nivel o no cumplirás las “metas” o no estarás al día, persigue el sueño, te dicen, pero mientras lo “persigues” todo lo que está a tu alrededor se va perdiendo, el tiempo, la familia, el disfrutar de tu entorno, de la vida en general, el mundo en este momento es un caos, tal como lo muestra el video, mientras pongan a alguien bailando frente a la pantalla, diciendo cosas como: soy muy lindo, tengo Gucci, la gente estará feliz( buscando poder mantener su enfoque en eso) por detrás, solo caos. No lo sé, quizás me equivoco, pero espero que se entienda a lo que voy, ya que es solo un pequeño sentimiento, del cual podría hablar horas y horas, pero la gente en general ya no pesca, o no presta atención, ya estamos siendo consumidos por el consumismo y es preocupante por lo menos",

I have heard it before in passing like on the radio or on other peoples playlists, but I had not really listened to it.  Surprisingly, I agree with Drake. I don’t think it’s a very good song, and I feel like this music video actually makes it worse. There was a point in my life I might have liked it, but now that I have stopped listening to rap music for a while. I go back and don’t like a lot of it. The message is poison to the spirit of anyone who consumes it, and as far as musical quality goes, I find it lacking real substance.  I couldn’t even finish to song. The dancing was weird, the music felt like a bad mash up of sounds, and the lyrics were garbage.",

My eyes popped out of my sockets I couldn’t even blink;   my jaw hit the floor;  mouth gaped wide open, completely unable to take a breathe;   my brain was in sensory overdrive;   I couldn’t breathe but I could feel my heart rapidly pounding both, inside my chest and my throat;  every hair on my body was sticking straight up;  body-  frozen in my seat…  My brain was trying to process the shock of me hearing and seeing someone having the such gumption to depict some of the most horrific realities of the past and realize: “but.. wait-.. it’s still THE SAME!!” and it was all real.  I’ve never seen a music video be this real and raw before and I was kind of dizzy, now. So just as I was about to take a good, deep breath, when: 1:55 .  Everything I just went through \u003d boomerang 🪃 x  (✔️2 pi) + (x✔️2 ♾️. . . . . )… When the video ended i continued to sit in my seat +👆🏻🔝remained the same). But I realized tears were streaming down my face.  Because: *THIS *IS America.*  Still.  I was moved, heartbroken and a trillion more feelings rushed over me but was also in awe and mad respect for Childish Gambino. I had to watch it again. And again. . . .+ . . . It’s one of the darkest, most riveting, brutally real epic piece of masterful brilliance.  Still.",

This song\u0027s lyrics is not poetic, it\u0027s nothing. He\u0027s saying nothing, his lyrics means nothing, and this video doesn\u0027t match the lyrics. His lyrics say this is America and says nothing about what is America. People say watch the video, for 1. if it was a good song, I wouldn\u0027t need to watch the video to understand what he\u0027s trying to say, IF he was actually saying something and 2. I thought I understood what was going on but the lyrics is literally not talking about anything. All he is saying is \" This is America (skrrt, skrrt, woo) Don\u0027t catch you slippin\u0027 now (ayy) Look how I\u0027m livin\u0027 now\" What\u0027s poetic about that?",
