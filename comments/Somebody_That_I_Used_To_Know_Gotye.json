  "One week ago he just blocked me without saying a thing after he said he needed time off everything one week before. Appeared with someone new right away. I gave him my heart, trusted him, and that\u0027s how he ended things, not even a goodbye. It hurts a lot right now, I lost weight, still cry everyday and can barely eat because of depression. But I\u0027ll come back stronger someday, and he will never find a person as honest as me, that loved him like I did, that cared like I did.   It\u0027s his loss. I\u0027ll win.  10.7.2025",

  "A child is born weak in every way. Above all, he needs the affection he receives from his parents or caregivers. They are his role models, and he learns many of their habits. Over time, these habits become instinctive and are stored in memory, but he may also acquire wrong habits, such as favoritism towards siblings or other wrong habits. Religion may also be a wrong habit. A child\u0027s mind is not yet fully developed, so how can he choose a religion and learn about God at an early age? For example, reproduction in nature and science is natural. It is very likely that a child will come and worship strange things. For example, if I change my religion, leave my family, travel to a faraway country, get married, and have a child, my child will come and worship my new religion. What a wrong principle in choosing a religion! This is the greatest evidence that God created us with the heart and mind to know God when we grow up. I have a suggestion for you: Food and drink contain happy hormones. Fast for ten full days. Abstain from food and drink until sunset.  Go to your temple and repeat, fast for another ten days, go to the mosque and pray with the congregation. Read in your own language, and that\u0027s fine. Where does peace and tranquility come from when you are in direct communion with God? Life is short. How long will you live? More than a hundred years, and then you will die. Only your work will benefit you. Everyone will abandon you. If you like it, follow my posts and share the post so that everyone can benefit.",

Sooner or later all creative stuff we thought was original will be found out to have been done before so melodies games art and all forms of writing a story or character will be done already by someone in the past with the same idea. Being limited allows creativity, but eventually, you will always run out of ideas that haven\u0027t been done before. Nothing is infinite, and certainly creativity isn\u0027t going to break through that either.",

Then, Anxiety came along. It\u0027s an ache I still remember. Anyone, including me, can easily get addicted to that certain kind of sadness. I was forced to listen it up to the end (always the end). I later found that me and Gotye could not make sense. He said that we would still be friends. I honestly admit I\u0027m glad it was over. But, I still think back to when Anxiety cut him off when it didn\u0027t have to. Now we\u0027ll have to make out like it never happened and now we\u0027re nothing. We didn\u0027t even need love, though. Everyone treated us like strangers and that felt so rough. Doechii really didn\u0027t have to stoop so low.

It really hurt me, but it was bound to happen.  Then I stopped contacting her. After one day we met accidentally, she asked me what happened, and I let her know.

  "A child is born weak in every way. Above all, he needs the affection he receives from his parents or caregivers. They are his role models, and he learns many of their habits. Over time, these habits become instinctive and are stored in memory, but he may also acquire wrong habits, such as favoritism towards siblings or other wrong habits. Religion may also be a wrong habit. A child\u0027s mind is not yet fully developed, so how can he choose a religion and learn about God at an early age? For example, reproduction in nature and science is natural. It is very likely that a child will come and worship strange things. For example, if I change my religion, leave my family, travel to a faraway country, get married, and have a child, my child will come and worship my new religion. What a wrong principle in choosing a religion! This is the greatest evidence that God created us with the heart and mind to know God when we grow up. I have a suggestion for you: Food and drink contain happy hormones. Fast for ten full days. Abstain from food and drink until sunset.  Go to your temple and repeat, fast for another ten days, go to the mosque and pray with the congregation. Read in your own language, and that\u0027s fine. Where does peace and tranquility come from when you are in direct communion with God? Life is short. How long will you live? More than a hundred years, and then you will die. Only your work will benefit you. Everyone will abandon you. If you like it, follow my posts and share the post so that everyone can benefit.",

  "Hey! So for a lot of us this song came out when we were kids. It came out on 2011 so I was 8 and we were harassed with it. It was always on the radio or on TV, we heard it all the time. And from what I\u0027ve seen on TikTok, a lot of us were terrified of the MV for some reason. And during 2011 ans 2012 it was very popular and now there is a song called Anxiety that uses the same instrumental as this song and it reminded people about this song. Now that I speak English (not the case in 2011) I understand the song, and it\u0027s about breakup and the reason is that the guy messed up while blaming the woman and when she moves on he is mad about it. I don\u0027t know if this comment will be helpful but this is basically about nostalgia",

  "Well written. The chronological flow makes your idea easy to grasp and your imagery is strong when you smash the radio.  I do have a question: When you say \u0027Anxiety\u0027 you refer to what? Is it a song? The normal meaning of _anxiety_ is that it signifies a human emotion. In such cases as when a song title is a commonly used word, you will serve the reader better if you provide context. As in, \"I work in retail, and the song \u0027Anxiety\u0027 comes on daily...[etc.].\"",

  "Your personification of anxiety is an apt metaphor. To say that one hears an entire emotion coming over the airwaves is to describe a feeling that has been shared by many. And in other contexts, one has heard happiness playing on the radio, and sadness playing on the radio, and memories playing on the radio.  But this song itself has an anxious tone. The male character is in distress. So, it\u0027s hard to follow the narrative of your choice to turn away from anxious sounds for the sake of playing an anxious song. Maybe your point was the irony inherent in your behavior. Ambiguity can be a very pleasing component to find in one\u0027s writing. Yet it is vital that your text does not tax the reader\u0027s capacity for comprehension.",

Using the instrumental wasn\u0027t what made it shitty but putting bad lyrics on a music we all know was shitty and only made us hate Anxiety.

  "It\u0027s not about her it\u0027s her song the problem. I don\u0027t have any problem with her or her voice she just ruined a song that so many people liked with lyrics that aren\u0027t that good. I don\u0027t care who she is I don\u0027t even know what she looks like and I\u0027m not even sure she wrote the lyrics in the first place. But in the end since I don\u0027t know who wrote them I criticise her if you can tell me that the writer is a white man than fuck him but it\u0027s not about him either it\u0027s about what this is and it\u0027s just bad lyrics on a music we love. Your just using racism and sexism as an excuse to avoid the idea that people don\u0027t lilke Anxiety and that\"s a problem. And no matter who would have sang this Anxiety would have been shit for me. Anxiety will never be art it will always be a proof that Gotye was better. You\u0027re trying to prove a point about sexism and racism when you are the only person who linked her song to her skin colour and her gender YOU ARE THE PROBLEM",
  "You want an example of a song made by a white man that is shitty even though it\u0027s a remix of another song ? I\u0027m good by david ghetta I hate his song because it\u0027s not the original and made just for money. If you change an old song you must be prepared to be criticised. And I have to say I hate his version even more than I hate doechi\u0027s song  Another exemple ? Upsilone - Everytime We Touch (don\u0027t know if it\u0027s well known) It\u0027s exactly the same lyrics but this time the rythme is different but I still hate it because to me the original is a hundred time better. Using old songs to do something new is almost never a good idea in my opinion. If it was a cover in honor of a dead artist I would consider it DECENT but as it is those 3 songs are bad. (If you don\u0027t like that i\u0027m saying bad just consider it as saying \"Not to my liking\" that\u0027s all)",

  "@@CarelyOG  I think anxiety is bad because of the lyrics. If your using the instrumental from an old song you have to make it so that it\u0027s better not worse. When we hear Anxiety the only thing we think about is Somebody that I used to know and that\u0027s a problem. It made her song the perfect Ragebait but not a good song. Her voice is good but clearly the efforts on the lyrics weren\u0027t good enough. You can\u0027t use an instrumental of a music with emotions and a good rythm and just put random shit together. It may be coherent for her but I hate it and find it hard to hear.  And you\u0027re just dumb. You\u0027re dumb because instead of aknowledging the fact that her song is not as good as Somebody that we used to know you\u0027re saying people who don\u0027t like doechy\u0027s song (A SONG not HER) are racist. It\u0027s not about her if the lyrics were written by someone else it would have been the same no matter the color of the skin or even the gender. You\u0027re using racism as an excuse to defend a song that doesn\u0027t even need to be defended and if racism wasn\u0027t enough you would have probably said it was sexism to but it\u0027s not it\u0027s just that if you Downgrade something you can\u0027t expect people who liked the original to like your downgrade. You have the right to like Anxiety but you don\u0027t have any reason to insult people because they don\u0027t like it. She had the right to make her song but we have the right to criticise it without being insulted for it.  You don\u0027t know which colour my skin is or even what my gender is how can you be so sure that it\u0027s racism ? But I guess I shouldn\u0027t expect much from you",

  "I just realized how deep the symbolism in this video goes. At the start, Gotye is unpainted — fully visible — meaning she still recognized him, still held on to some emotional connection. But as the video progresses, he slowly fades into the background, literally becoming “some body” she used to know. The wordplay is genius: \"somebody\" as in a person from the past, and \"some body\" as in a vague, faceless figure now lost in memory. His emotional breakdown shows he’s just now realizing what he lost — but it’s too late. When Kimbra enters, she’s already painted, already faded, like she was disappearing emotionally long before he noticed. Her verse reframes everything: she wasn’t cold — she was hurt, dismissed, and now done. And when she walks away and her paint fades completely, it shows she’s free, while he remains stuck in guilt and realization — still painted, still invisible. This video isn’t just about heartbreak — it’s about how we only truly see someone after they’re gone.",
  "…CHATGP-",
  "Yes and no, I used it to reformulate it in a better way because this was difficult to explain. I came up myself with the wordplay, meaning about the paint, emotional roller-coaster and how he himself is truly the one who saw her another way before he did.

The reason why it receives a lot of hate is because it was EVERYWHERE and when a song is literally inescapable and a constant throughout social media (I\u0027m looking at you TikTok/YouTube shorts) it gets old extremely quick and people get annoyed by it. Another factor of the \"Anxiety\" fatigue is that many of us are familiar with the sample(this one is not the og either btw) from our youth and with how annoying \"Anxiety\" has grown to be while also said sample, many then acquire the urge to revisit this song for a sence of \"relief\" since \"Anxiety\" does juke the absolute sh!t outta us the first couple seconds.",

He had the chance to earn millions — effortlessly — and redirect that money to do something meaningful: help his family, support his friends, fund medical treatments, donate to charities. He could’ve made a real difference in people’s lives without compromising his artistic integrity in any way. He didn’t even need to talk about it — just quietly take the money and do some good. Instead, he walked away from that possibility, and for what? To protect his art from commercialization? That might make sense in theory, but in practice, it feels like a privileged gesture disconnected from the real world. Millions of people struggle daily just to survive. Most would give anything to be in his position — not to buy luxury, but to protect loved ones or afford basic dignity. This isn’t about fame. It’s about wasting a rare opportunity to create impact. And when someone throws that away — especially when so many don’t even get the chance — it doesn’t feel noble. It feels irresponsible.",

Being almost entirely composed from other songs it is a sampled collage of fleeting and incomplete memories that are warped and layered over one another, creating a tightly woven tapestry of the past. It is all the best bits of memories roughly yet passionately stitched together to create a masterpiece that is not just a break up song, but THE break up song. Every millisecond of this song evokes every memory of everyone I have loved and lost in my journey to understand who I am and what I am to share with the world. Many songs have lyrical mastery, harmonic adeptness or just pure soul, but this song has everything all firmly baked into it\u0027s very being. This is timeless art and was instantly recognized by everyone as such, even if they didn\u0027t outwardly realize it immediately. Pure genius.",

For a long time I looked out from my island, not noticing that my tree had grown. I felt hungry, and one day I wondered what would happen if I climbed my tree. From there I saw something, brothers, on the near horizon, the dawn of a better tomorrow. I listened to your hearts and raised a cry that travels through time. I feel you, I see you, I hear you, brother. SEEK ME, SPREAD THE WORD. THE FLAME IS MORE ALIVE THAN EVER. I FELT THEIR MUSIC FLOW THROUGH ME. FEELING THEM NOT TO DOUBT. I CUT DOWN MY TREE AND BUILT A BOAT. I SEE THEIR LIGHTS. I SEEK THEM. NOW I SEEK THEM. COME! GET ON MY BOAT! THE ADVENTURE HAS NEVER BEEN MORE REAL! I\u0027VE GOT THE KEYS AND THE LOCKS.

  "What a powerful performance; the lyrics were already interesting and full of the emotional content of a failed relationship but after watching it again 13 years later, the music video really seems to depict the meaning of this song with such clarity. Essentially, the man in the first verse (gotye) isn’t talking to the woman that responds in the second verse (kimbra), but rather to the partner he had before her. He’s fixated on the failure of this prior relationship while involved in a new one, which ultimately leads to the failure of the latter; the wild thing is that by the end, he starts fixating on the second woman in the same way as the first, only after she cuts herself out of his life and they see eachother as somebody that they used to know.

  "Somebody That I Used to Know,\" by Gotye featuring Kimbra, samples several tracks. The most prominent sample is from Luiz Bonfá\u0027s \"Seville\", which also inspired the song\u0027s lyrics, according to Billboard. Other sampled tracks include \"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep\" and \"Memphis\".  Here\u0027s a more detailed breakdown: Luiz Bonfá\u0027s \"Seville\": This instrumental track\u0027s melody was the basis for the song\u0027s vocal melody.  Traditional Folk Song \"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep\": The song\u0027s melody was also influenced by this folk tune.  \"Memphis\" by Lonnie Mack: This track is also sampled in the song.  Other samples: Gotye also used samples from \"Woke Up This Morning\" by Mexicali Brass, \"The Exodus Song\" by Luiz Bonfá, \"Puerto De Barranquilla\" by Los Machucambos, and \"Co-Gona Voodoo\" by Chaino and His African Percussion.

But you didn\u0027t have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothin\u0027 And I don\u0027t even need your love But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough No, you didn\u0027t have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number Guess that I don\u0027t need that, though Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over But had me believin\u0027 it was always somethin\u0027 that I\u0027d done But I don\u0027t wanna live that way Readin\u0027 into every word you say You said that you could let it go And I wouldn\u0027t catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know But you didn\u0027t have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothin\u0027 (ah) And I don\u0027t even need your love But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough (ah) No, you didn\u0027t have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (ah) Guess that I don\u0027t need that, though Now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know Somebody I used to know Somebody (now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know) Somebody I used to know Somebody (now you\u0027re just somebody that I used to know) I used to know That I used to know I used to know  Someboooody.",
