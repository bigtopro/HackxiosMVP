  "I recently lost my Nana, my mom\u0027s mother, we had her celebration of life 4 weeks ago and buried her the weekend before last. I woke up yesterday to the news that my Aunt (My Nana\u0027s daughter and my mom\u0027s sister) just died the night before from a heart attack. Today I woke up to the news that my Aunt Crystal who has been in remmision from breast cancer after having a double mastectomy for 7 years, has just tested positive again for breast cancer. I\u0027m really hoping that that saying bad things come in 3\u0027s because I\u0027m not sure how much more my mom can take. It takes me a while to actually feel my feelings because I\u0027m good at ignoring/burying them. Eventually they will come out but my mom and aunt are taking all of this very hard. My mom had my Nana live with her and my dad for the last 8 months of her life caring for her 24/7. Then came the night she died. 2 of my sister\u0027s were there, my mom, dad, cousin and Aunt Crystal, I held her hand as she took her last breath. It was the first time I had ever been there and watched someone pass. I\u0027m not looking for simpathy or anything like that but if you are someone who prays (I usually am not) but I would ask that you would pray from my Aunt Crystal and my mom. They have both been through so much losing their mom and then their sister within 7 months and now my aunt\u0027s new diagnosis. Thank you for all of you who do. ❤",

  "As a ten year old girl, I have learned trusting people is fake. The one girl I had with me while I cried, and I could trust her with my secrets turned my back on me. I met her when I was senen, and I walked up to her while she was crying, and invited her to the playground. After that, we became besties, like inseparable besties. Until we moved schools. It was okay at first, but she started hitting me, suttle and playfully, so I put up with it. But it staryed getting constant. The first “fight” was in ag, we were playing a game, and Seattle (name pf my “bestie”) said “Ellie (my name) can you read the instructions?” This wouldn’t have been a big deal if she didn’t know that I had social anxiety and struggled to read in front of people, so I said no. Not a big deal, right? Well, to Seattle it was a HUGE deal, and she started hitting, and punching me. “Seattle, stop hitting me, or I will call my mom” I said, but she wouldn’t stop, so at lunch, I called my mom, and told her everything. Only to find put seattle was crying on the ground while charlotte (our bestie) was reporting every single word I said to my mom to her. Luckily, I was a smart 8 year old, and shut  it down FAST. Only the next week, I found a feather and thought that it would be funny to put it into my hair, so I did. Next class, I set down the feather on the table and got up to get my homework. Only to sit back down and find Seattle with the same feather brushing it against her nose. Seattle, that is my feather, can I have it back? Is all I said before seattle said “oh, I put it up my nose” she said. Like WTH? So I said I don’t care, and got my feather back. But I found her writing in a little note “I found a random feather on the table, and picked it up, bit then Ellie got mad and took ot from me” is all I could read. I knew she was going to give that to her mom. I didn’t freaking care at that time. The next day, perfectly normal, like Seattle is acting all kind, and like my teal bestie I once knew. Thats the thing with Seattle, she will be kind, and the best bestie one day, and the next hour, she totally flips on you. So I was confused, but was happy she was kind agin. The next day, Lena said to me “girl, grace says your mean” just casually. Well THAT started a round of crying, saddness, and confusion. So ofc, I called my friend Sandra. I am jealous of Sandra and she is the only friend I will EVER trust. So yeah after that I found out Seattle was spreading rumors and telling lies, and my secrets behind my back! What a surprise!  Im on summer now, and I am trying to figure out weather I should tell Seattle im not being her friend, or be bffs with her. WILL BE UPDATED Update #1: so LENA just was acting like a freaking jerk in four square. I was in the front of the line, and LENA come and cut me, so I told her I was in front of her, but someone got out and she went in the square. She laughed that laugh that always bothered me, that over exaggerated laugh someone does when they are lying. And said: “the line is over HERE” and I said “than why is everyone lined up over HERE?” But she ignored me, and I walked away, and didn’t talk to her for the rest of the last week of school, and now im declining every invite to her house to hang out",
  "I kinda don’t like this song is because it makes me remember that I am moving in one or two years I am ganna miss my friends so much 😢",
  "How does he know how I feel depressed and sad. They say women can handle depression and emotional things. Yeah, I can’t my parents call me a bad person starting to think that I am my friends are fake. I think I am the only fake one here. I want die. Like when he said “ and you’re praying, nobody comes in and asks why” so true bruh when somebody comes in when you’re crying because of depression, it’s hard to explain why you’re depressed in the first place",

As the year went by I tried time and time again to clime out of this emotional sink hole I fell into. I am still trying, but this song, this song gave me enough energy to keep going. I don’t know if Parker realised it but he mourned with me, because I do know what it’s like to silently cry at night and hope with all of your shattered heart that nobody comes through that door. So thank you Parker Jack, thank you with all of my bruised, bloodied, broken heart for morning with me.",

I was in the photo  and she said my crush deleted the message, but she didn’t even show me the message in the first place which to me is kind of suss and also kind of got embarrassed like in front of the class with my friend because she grabbed my waist when she came back to the bathroom unexpectedly and like I screamed, but I also kind of like moaned like a little bit.

  "Hey guys, this is really tough for me to say this but I’m 12 years old and I’ve been like this for like basically since I was 10 two years now he had been depressed because of family problems for my dad did to me when I was younger now he’s in jail. I never see him anymore cause I hate him. I never wanna see him again. I hope he stays up my life forever and ever, I hope he doesn’t come try to fight me again again cause he was the one who gave me angry issues and depression as I always get bullied from it. I tried to show on the outside but I’m really got on the inside and it’s really hard for me every day I come home crying in my room, my mum sorry for me. I just say that I’m fine and I secretly away from her but I’m currently to him right now so hard for me to say this myself to sleep every night and I do deserve this. Has a 12 years old 12-year-old girl with no car with no friends I literally had free. I literally heard my friends three of them let me down so I’ve got two friends but I’m not sure if I can even trust them two friends everyone I have friends. I’ve always let me down always make fun of me when we have an argument and I don’t want this. I just wanna find the perfect one. I’ve gone through five rejections in my life. I can’t find the person who’s waiting for me. I think I’m just gonna die alone. I’m gonna be depressed forever and I’m just gonna have to die alone in my room crying to myself every night, I just hide this away from my I don’t have to find out why I’ve been going through. It was really hard for me to say to you guys thanks for listening. Good night.",

  "I was scrolling threw shorts and I passed this song I listened to the short thoroughly every time thinking about my life I eventually found the song and listened to the song 125 times and cried to each replay at least 55 times eyes puffy and red continuedly thinking about why this song hit me so emotionally, after doing this I became numb not with no feelings but to where I don\u0027t know how to show so I bury them deeper and deeper my great grandmother died at least 2 or three years ago my uncle died 1 year ago thatmade mydad take it all out on me and my brother and move and never talk to us again my grandfather died when I was 3 or 4 years old. I am currently getting bullied at school and getting framed for taking stuff at home, my mom made me stop talking to my best friend in the world the only person I was able to let my feelings out to bc her sister lied on her and my mom found out my mom got a new puppy and everyone has been putting the stress on me to take care of it. At school, I have the most amazing best friends a and E I love them to the end and we are moving to south Philly soon so I\u0027m not going to have them anymore my cat Bella died 2 years ago not only did I hug her through my worst times she comforted me threw the truly worst times my moms side of the family don\u0027t even like me. My life is a struggle and I can never pay attention to my feelings I have to worry about everyone else first. So you can\u0027t imagine how it feels to go on YouTube and find an artist with a song that explains how I feel every day or what I do every day, so I want to thank Parker Jack, I have to pretend to be fine it\u0027s not right, edit: thank u so much for everyone who replied i appericate alot that you took the time to read my paragraph of a story and replie or like",

I was suicidal at 10 and almost became suicidal again, I managed to prevent it, barely though. Going here to connect with my past. I learned to have my past as my roots and not the strings that control me. I’m happy, to put it simply. My shadow and I have definitely been negotiating. I have a LOT to improve but I’m doing good One more time shall I? I’ve been doing so fucking good. Life is amazing, I’m managing to get self-control back, I’m smiling, and the voice that beats me up finally shut up.

  "OK like I’m a kid and I go to school on this literally reminds me of me I just wanna cry but I can’t let the feelings come out like literally this Friday. I got pushed over down the hill road hit the back of my head. Oh, and guess what the nurse just gave me an ice pack? What about my leg still has a crack in it I can barely even walk and it was a bunch of fourth graders that were playing soccer. I’ll try to play a song or two and then we kept on saying that they were cheating because they kept on pushing and you can’t push in soccer and then one of them just walks up to me right behind me, pushes me down the hill that’s the size look like let me say like 20 feet tall rolling down the hill hitting the back of my neck I like bro this is happened to me like once or twice. This is happening 23 times to me. Why am I always the target maybe I am weak. I do not care, they do everything I want but I do not want them to touch single single on my family. That’s where I will rage killed him and I will do anything to protect my family for who I love you can do anything to me just not them they are the only ones that understand me get how it feels to be like this. When I get bullied I get pushed and pushed down a hill that’s 20 feet tall and about 30 feet wide it hurts and guess what I hit my forehead on the cement and then after that, I hit the back of my head. My back on the driveway caught up, kept running my arm, felt numb. I couldn’t even move it for like about like two days. My other arm was fine and my dominant hand is my right arm and that’s the one that had to heal for two days and turns out one of her I went to the nurse she had an x-ray. She checked my legs and it turns out they had a crack in it and all she did was do something for my head and I’m like oh what about my leg it has a crack in it and then she’s like who is that? It’s going to go away in a couple of months and I’m like want call 911 I like everyone’s rude to me like bro that’s all I do. I go under my sheets and start crying because like Bro why do they do this to me? I don’t even know what I did wrong like I did not push them and guess what I’m the new kid at my school and then some other student just got in the school and I’m like wow and he got a tour of the whole school and I’m like bro what about me? I’m a new student to. I still don’t even know where the nurses today. I don’t even know how to get to the nurse kindergartener had to take me all the way over there and I still didn’t even know like bro for real. They get the special treatment.but I don’t 😢",
