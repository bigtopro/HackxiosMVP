  "Arjun Reddy, Kabir Singh, and Adithya Varma are all very goated movies! Shahid delivered such a goated interpretation of Arjun since his remake had a higher budget/cast, and he delivered a lot of more fast and violent action, and how can I leave out Dhruv, he slowed us true indian style power and it was his debut for acting and he nailed every single part of his character with absolute no regret. But Vijay is the original and the goat since he was the first to deliver us with this goated movie! (Varmaa does not exist in our eyes since it was the prototype Adithya Varma and no one likes it)",

  "Ok lets come to conclusion whether arjun reddy is better or kabir singh is better. Acting:- VJD( Shahid actually did better but tbh VJD was natural and shahid just enacted) Fight:- shahid( The fight scenes in kabir singh was actually good or better than arjun reddy) Heroine:- Kiara Advani ( Sorry Shalini, kiara simply nailed it) Story:- Both are same so its common. Lov scenes:- Kabir scene(Arjun reddy love scenes where great but few scenes were to much. Whereas in kabir singh scenes are beautifully done)   Role of shiva:- sorry both have done great job Emotion:- Shahid( Even tho VJD was first to do that, Shahid has that natural emotions because he himself is a love failure so many emotional scenes were great in kabir singh. Dialogues:- Arjun reddy( Man those intense dialogues were goosebumps. Editing:- Both were long movie so its equal. Location and light pattern:- both are good, but kabir singh location and light pattern were really good. Attitude:- VJD( man this guy has got serious attitude was actually natural than shahid). Supporting role:- Both movie supporting role was outstanding but one on arjun reddy was marginally good. Songs and music:- (both were great but kabir singh songs were too addicted and good to hear) Getup and stylish- VJD(man this guy so adaptive to that character. Overall kabir singh -6              Arjun Reddy-5 Since Arjun reddy is 2 years old film, the director has fullfil all the gaps which he left in arjun reddy. So an extra mark to Arjun reddy for shadowing extra details kabir singh and also this was a remake. Verdict conclusion  Kabir singh 6 Arjun reddy 6. Both are great in their perspective. So hatsoff to both of them and cant deny both justify their role. Thankyou and have great day.",

  "who is still watching September 2018?? Made with top quality natural ingredients,  Our Hand Made, Natural , Cold process soap offers a sensory experience that just can’t be matched by commercially-made alternatives. Free from artificial ingredients and drying detergents, cold process natural soaps are skin-kind with a luxuriously creamy lather that perfectly pampers your skin every day.   Ingredients: Olive Oil, Almond Oil, Palm Oil, Coconut Oil, Sesame Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Castor Oil, Neem Seed Oil, Peanut Oil \u0026 Lye (For Saponification) with essential Oils.   Free From Harmful Chemicals:   Sodium Lauryl Sulphate, Urea Derivatives, PVP/VA Copolymer, Parabens, Stearalkonium Chloride, Tea Compounds et al. No Add Synthetic Fragrance, preservative or Colour   Usage:  To make your organic soap longer, keep it dry in between uses. Store in Cool and Dry place away from sun light, heat and moisture.   Benefits of Cold Process Soap: 1. The Creamy Feel Cold process soap made with all-natural ingredients creates a creamy lather for deep moisturization. Unlike other soap types, cold process versions penetrate deep into into the skin to help minimize dry itchy skin. 2. Powerfully Natural The benefits of natural soap making ingredients like coconut oil, olive oil , Almond Oil,… can be lost through the heating process in hot process soap techniques; the cold process method ensures these natural ingredients are better preserved. 3. Intensive Scent Cold process soaps are fragranced with natural essential oils. Because cold process soap takes a number of weeks to fully cure, the scent intensifies over time. 4. Luxurious Lather Unlike hot process soap, alternatives made through the cold process method can be skilfully whipped for the lightest touch, even floating on water! Cold process soap has the ability to create incredible lather to allow a truly luxurious bathing sensation. 5. Environment Friendly We do not use any kind of energy resource and use only Edible Oils/plant based Oils to make these soaps   www.Mylo.co.in +91-7660844296,9949565390",

While yesterday chuckles at me,  for there is going to be no tomorrow weeping at this moment.  You\u0027re my life, and my very heart.  You have become the burning flame of my  eternal soul . Unknown to the vision ,  How did something occur. From now on ,there is never going to be you and me, Why is that so.  At the blink of an eye, a fault has happened,  remaining as an unspoken rage. Chasing like a swell of the sea. , my presence is nothing  without yours, defends this moment,  You\u0027re my conclusion,  you\u0027re my resolution .  How big is my resolution , As vast as the universe.",
