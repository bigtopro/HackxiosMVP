  "Eu vivo dentro do meu próprio mundo de faz de conta Crianças gritando em seus berços, palavrões Eu vejo o mundo através de olhos cobertos de tinta e água sanitária Risque aqueles que ouviram meus gritos e me viram chorar Eu amo tudo O fogo está se espalhando por todo o meu quarto Meu mundo é tão brilhante É difícil respirar, mas está tudo bem Silêncio, psiu. Feche meus olhos com fita adesiva para forçar a realidade (Oh, não, não) Por que você não me deixa comer meu peso de alegria? Eu vivo dentro do meu próprio mundo de faz de conta Crianças gritando em seus berços, palavrões Alguns dias me sinto mais magro do que em todos os outros dias Às vezes não consigo dizer se meu corpo me pertence Eu amo tudo O fogo está se espalhando por todo o meu quarto Meu mundo é tão brilhante É difícil respirar, mas está tudo bem Silêncio, psiu, eu quero provar seu conteúdo Prenda a respiração e sinta a tensão Os demônios se escondem atrás da redenção A honestidade é uma porta de mão única para o inferno Eu quero provar o consumo Respire mais rápido para desperdiçar oxigênio Ouça as crianças cantando em voz alta É música até o pavio queimar Silêncio Só quero ficar despreocupado ultimamente, sim Só chutando margaridas Tenho muitas moedas de 25 centavos nos meus bolsos Conto-os como os trevos de quatro folhas no meu medalhão Cadarços desamarrados, sim Apenas viajando em devaneios Tenho pequenas canções de ninar sujas tocando repetidamente Poderia muito bem apodrecer no berçário e contar ovelhas",

  "So I think I know the backstory here he probably is interested inside you know AR make belief and stuff and fantasy, but then it went too far and then he just hallucinated everything he likes, but he had a little bit too much imagination where he had control of it at first, but now it’s just gone rambling but he he knows there’s not fire there except Except for some reason the imaginary hallucinating is coming real cause he said it’s hard to breathe of course that was imaginary fire but wait a minute no when your body gets scared sometimes it produces you know the slimy boogers inside your nose cause cause like when you’re scared you you kind of panic and in for that you squeeze, you squeeze the back of your nose, not even knowing you could do that and then you squeeze all the snot out And then that makes it hard to breathe and then it crusts up after time so then it’s hard to breathe, but then will he has gone completely crazy now in like he loves everything except think about blow your nose or maybe he had the hallucination that you know everything’s on fire and even the paper towels and And he’s not that afraid but he’s afraid to touch it. That’s the problem but he’s not afraid to walk through it because he knows it’s imaginary but then to touch it with his hands in his body rather than his feet his legs and stomach almost makes him get killed because he thinks he thinks some of his body is enable to the imaginary fire, but some of it like his hands and stuff He’s gonna get burnt and he doesn’t grab a tissue because oh of course that’s on fire and why and why don’t you try to pick your note to try to get all of that out and I’m sorry if it’s gross you gotta do what you gotta do and well let me guess. Your nose is on fire, but if it’s on fire that might’ve melted all of the all of the snot inside your nose, imagine little bitty flame that could’ve been our noses could’ve been like vulnerable or not vulnerable to you know fire so then that little bitty thing inside your nose, which replaces the oxygen with a fire if we could fire breathe, then that’s not would’ve been already gone by now And that’s why dragons can smell so good. Why can dogs smell so good they have a special it’s not breakdown liquid kind of thing and cats have the same thing in my breathing has gotten better and my breathing has gotten better. You know why it’s not there. OK we’re here inside the nose now let’s prevent anything from saving this nose from the blockage, which we are the blockage.  stopped right here and there. Oh come on. oh come on you’re trying to clear his nose right yeah well yes just one thing we don’t understand what is that he’s not even a cat. He’s a human well he’s well. He’s partially a skin walker. OK well what does that have to do with anything how is he a cat if he’s a skin walk skin walker can take whatever phone they want except he probably hasn’t learned to use his abilities. That’s why we all hear him just ramble in about some spells. Now he wants chameleon eyes and now he figured out he could switch between spells, and God told him how to do it darn, you don’t say that to God he he he’s the one that saved all of us all of us cause we’re just obstacles, but some of us didn’t actually manage to get thrown away so be thankful forgot to do that. OK I’m liquid. I’m good liquid it dissolves germs and you’re just germs. Well, yeah so you’re bad you and now you’re gonna have to dissolve. your body off well OK but another thing I don’t understand we don’t understand yeah what is that well the thing is how was he gonna get a spell to turn into a chameleon he knows how to switch between form but he’s only got DNA of a cat DNA from a chameleon. I don’t know yeah that’s right and he has to be alone for another 50 hours, oh come on it wasn’t that bad if he’s gonna turn into a chameleon or Jim book he’s he likes those. What are you talking about it’s called a June bug yeah those things are quite cute. I can’t blame him, except if he probably had a pair of wings that he would be just like that and he would be clumsy he would knock everything and he would have to get small so he probably will have to get that small seriously if he’s gonna turn into a bug. He’s gonna need to get smaller and look at his size now he’s lost weight so he’s been eating Froot Loops all day. That’s how to lose weight and also he’s got that DNA from his pet cat tiger he’s getting smaller and losing weight so now he can get on a box he still needs to eat more. Froot Loops stuff doesn’t seem to work that’s right where did you come from my room? I was just on the chair now. I’m walking around I see. see you like two bugs right it’s called a June bug shut up. liquid so you like bugs right yeah I’m mostly like June bugs I like all types of bugs and animals. I’m gonna get DNA one. You could hold a horse in your hand. OK no you gross. I don’t mean to say that to the poor Ju bug who died but I’m sorry June bugs it’s just I don’t wanna force you force your corpse into my hand.",

  "Absolutely, social media unfortunately (speaking about the elephant in the room) doesn\u0027t provide a platform for cohesion (it may have been thought of) but was never designed for the intent specifically as its more profitable to keep users online (as most platforms make money through advertising) and entertained, fighting (divided or majority opposed) for something or over such. Its a different reality that takes advantage of our primal weaknesses. Its hard to turn a big ship quickly so it better to develop general understanding simultaneously whilst fighting the cause, making a statement provides exposure, complaining becomes part of the problem.  The most unfortunate part is that for now, we lack cohesive thinking, an as much as you can educate someone, their willingness ton learn is up to them, and their exposure bias is theirs\u0027 to own and decide on too.",

  "❤Ishia 53:5 \"But He was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed\" Jesus died for our sins he is not a false prophet but its the fulfillment of the  Prophecies  deuteronemy 18:18 \"I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites, and I will put my words in his mouth. He will tell them everything I command him\" ishia 9:6 \"For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulder. And His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace\" Jesus is our messiah dont turn your back on him he loves you Do you like the prodigal and return to God son he sinned against the father God and ran away from him and sinned agianst the father but he came back The father was so happy to have him back that while he was still a long ways off he ran towards him and embraced him Back then distinguished men wouldn\u0027t run as it was seen as disgraceful but the father loved the son so much and was so happy to have him back he ran towards him anyway and when he did he took him back into his family with open arms even slaughtering the fat and cow which was a big deal only killed for specail occasions which they had been preparing That\u0027s how God will be if you come back to him because he loves you and just wants to have you back (This story is in luke 15:11-33) You are valuable and your life does have a purpose God made you perfectly in his image and he is a plan for your life Jesus loves you john 3:16 fear THE lord he died for your sins so that whoever believe in him will not perish but have eternal life and escape hell no one will enter heaven by living a good life but though true faith in him we will be saved We\u0027ve all sinned and deserve hell but jesus paid the pricePLEASE PRAY THIS PRAYER FORM THE HEART AND TRLUY MEAN IT AND YOULL BE SAVED Prayer for giving your life to Christ Lord I recognise I am a sinner In need of the Savoir And I trust in the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ Who is God come in human form to die for my sins And I confess my sins to you Asking for forgiveness Asking that you would make me a new creation and fill me with the Holy Spirit Lord I want to live for you from this Day forward Asking you would guide me To live and follow your commandments So I trust you Lord in Your life death and resurrection from this Day forward In Jesus name AmenYou are valuable and your life does have a purpose God made you perfectly in his image and he is a plan for your life Jesus loves you john 3:16 fear THE lord he died for your sins so that whoever believe in him will not perish but have eternal life and escape hell no one will enter heaven by living a good life but though true faith in him we will be saved We\u0027ve all sinned and deserve hell but jesus paid the price PLEASE PRAY THIS PRAYER FORM THE HEART AND TRLUY MEAN IT AND YOULL BE SAVED",

  "Years went by, and I couldn\u0027t understand the creepiness of this song, but I think i finally solved this. Please relisten to the masterpiece of this song before I ruin it for you. First off, WHAT\u0027S WITH ALL THE WHITE? The reason he\u0027s always in white besides the few times he\u0027s outside of \u0027everything\u0027 so to say.... yes.... he\u0027s in a mental esylum. He\u0027s in there for misbehaving towards babies, probably. He loves \u0027everything\u0027 because he\u0027s been in the white prison for so long that he doesn\u0027t remember the outside world, so the mental esylum is everything he knows. The reason he doesn\u0027t say \u0027Blood and bleach\u0027 is because he doesn\u0027t remember that it\u0027s blood that he played with, and he sees in \u0027ink and bleach\u0027 because there is only right and wrong in the prison. He constantly makes up stuff because he\u0027s been locked away from human interaction and stimulation that he\u0027s forced himself to bring the stimulation opon himself. The reason he sees so many white mannequins is because the workers leaving him behind once human rights people burning down the place, at least that\u0027s what I gathered from the actions and stuff, and now he is stuck as the place goes up in flames and his brain fills in the gaps. Eventually, the fire comes to his room, and he bangs his hand against the wall while in his straight jacket during his last moments. You\u0027re welcome for the explanation that I\u0027ve made over the years this has been out for.",

Even then the depression still seeps through. The people who don’t hide from reality are too busy making it worse to realize what they’re doing. The only thing that makes life worth living is my Christian beliefs. Now, the only things that keep people from going insane are devices to entertain them. It starts to make you wonder why virtual reality was really created. The other thing that people think can clear there depression is “romance” which there are few real cases of. Usually modern romance is just a sexual relationship with no real feelings besides sexual attraction. If you feel the same, I would ask you to become a Christian, and look at near by churches for more information. Cause maybe we can help the world a little.",

I live inside my own world of make-believe Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days Sometimes I can\u0027t tell if my body belongs to me I love everything Fire\u0027s spreading all around my room My world\u0027s so bright It\u0027s hard to breathe but that\u0027s alright Hush Shh I wanna taste your content Hold your breath and feel the tension Devils hide behind redemption Honesty is a one-way gate to hell I wanna taste consumption Breathe faster to waste oxygen Hear the children sing aloud It\u0027s music \u0027til the wick burns out Hush Just wanna be care free lately, yeah Just kicking up daisies Got one too many quarters in my pockets Count ’em like the four leaf clovers in my locket Untied laces, yeah Just tripping on daydreams Got dirty little lullabies playing on repeat Might as well just rot around the nursery and count sheep",

I live inside my own world of make-believe Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days Sometimes I can\u0027t tell if my body belongs to me I love everything Fire\u0027s spreading all around my room My world\u0027s so bright It\u0027s hard to breathe but that\u0027s alright Hush Shh I wanna taste your content Hold your breath and feel the tension Devils hide behind redemption Honesty is a one-way gate to hell I wanna taste consumption Breathe faster to waste oxygen Hear the children sing aloud It\u0027s music \u0027til the wick burns out Hush Just wanna be care free lately, yeah Just kicking up daisies Got one too many quarters in my pockets Count ’em like the four leaf clovers in my locket Untied laces, yeah Just tripping on daydreams Got dirty little lullabies playing on repeat Might as well just rot around the nursery and count sheep",

He compares this to the ways of innocent children who haven’t learned to mask their true identities. Reflecting on the reality of adulthood, he notes that we carry an unspoken obligation to mask ourselves. Lest we come across as rude, brash, or even crazy, we filter our true thoughts before speaking aloud and suppress our desires instead of acting them out.",

  "Amor fati. Essa expressão latina, que possue algumas interpretações, dentre as quais: “amor ao destino”, “amar o fado” ou, como tenho aceitado “amar o processo”. Inspirado no estoicismo e na filosofia de Nietzsche, essa frase verbal me lembra um momento importante da minha vida, onde precisei fazer uma escolha. Não vou entrar em detalhes da escolha, mas muitos me julgaram e acharam-me louco quando a fiz. Agora que já passou um ano, posso afirmar que não me arrependo. Contudo, o foco do texto não é falar sobre mim, mas o que aprendi dessa decisão. Senhores e senhoras, eu tenho enxergado que ao longo dessa vida teremos diversas opções de caminhos. Por vezes, ficaremos na dúvida entre duas opções que são complexas de escolher. A verdade é que independentes qual seja a escolha, teremos de conviver com ela.  “Dudu, você está me dizendo que amor fati é aceitarmos o que vier a acontecer conosco?” Sim! Porém calma. Calma que não é no sentido conformista, mas no sentido realista. No sentido de que verdadeiramente você só tem o AGORA.  Pois então, curta-o. Ou como diz em Eclesiastes “HEVEL” Explico essa segunda palavra em outro post. Até mais.",

I live inside my own world of make-believe Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days Sometimes I can\u0027t tell if my body belongs to me I love everything Fire\u0027s spreading all around my room My world\u0027s so bright It\u0027s hard to breathe but that\u0027s alright Hush Shh I wanna taste your content Hold your breath and feel the tension Devils hide behind redemption Honesty is a one-way gate to hell I wanna taste consumption Breathe faster to waste oxygen Hear the children sing aloud It\u0027s music \u0027til the wick burns out Hush Just wanna be care free lately, yeah Just kicking up daisies Got one too many quarters in my pockets Count ’em like the four leaf clovers in my locket Untied laces, yeah Just tripping on daydreams Got dirty little lullabies playing on repeat Might as well just rot around the nursery and count sheep",

  "Jesus, this whole song just screams messed up childhood. I can deeply identify with this, the lyrics and the imagery. It\u0027s so well made. This is truly art. I suffer from a bad case of not being able to read people\u0027s facial expressions and feeling estranged from the world as a whole and other people. I can read extreme emotions somewhat well, but then again they seem like distorted reality or cinema to me. Call it Aspergers or call it Childhhod Trauma. The scenes with the mannequins reflect so hard how i see everyday life (yes it is a little exaggerated though), just life forms that I cannot understand and seem strange to me, kind of menacing not knowing why they are here with me or whether they are friendly, but here and there, when a strong emotion flickers through, I can see their emotions very clearly, although always wondering whether they are truly genuine or not.  It\u0027s eerie how much this video reflects on a metaphorical level what I am dealing witth everyday. Don\u0027t know if it was intended this way, but Sub Urban is definitely a genius. Never had anything else trigger a feeling of familiarity inside of me like that before, not even (or especially not) other people.",

Иди по своим следам...... Скажи, расскажи, как быть живым? Может я знаю чего-то, чего у меня нет Открывай свое сердце - вот и весь секрет .....

(Chorus) Dangerously close to the edge, where sanity fades, I\u0027m hanging by a thread, in this treacherous charade, But I won\u0027t let go, I\u0027ll fight against the tide, I\u0027ll find my way back, from this perilous ride. (Verse 2) The voices in my head, they scream and they shout, Pulling me closer, to the edge of doubt, In this twisted maze, where reality bends, I\u0027m searching for solace, as my mind descends. (Chorus) Dangerously close to the edge, where sanity fades, I\u0027m hanging by a thread, in this treacherous charade, But I won\u0027t let go, I\u0027ll fight against the tide, I\u0027ll find my way back, from this perilous ride. (Bridge) But in the midst of chaos, a flicker of hope, A glimmer of light, helping me to cope, I\u0027ll gather my strength, and push through the pain, I won\u0027t let this darkness, drive me insane. (Verse 3) With every step I take, I\u0027m reclaiming my ground, I won\u0027t let this breakdown, keep me bound, In this battle for my mind, I\u0027ll rise above, I\u0027ll find my inner strength, and rediscover love. (Chorus) Dangerously close to the edge, where sanity fades, I\u0027m hanging by a thread, in this treacherous charade, But I won\u0027t let go, I\u0027ll fight against the tide, I\u0027ll find my way back, from this perilous ride. (Outro) I may have been close, but I won\u0027t let it define, I\u0027ll keep moving forward, with a heart that\u0027s aligned, No longer on the edge, I\u0027ll find solid ground, I\u0027ll conquer this darkness, and turn it around.",

This song is underrated which is the proof that it\u0027s a real art, a conscious development and selfawareness of how the artist accepts the conscious that he found\u0027 with love and that too with the highest level of boldness. IT IS THE BOLDNESS THAT AN ARTIST STRIVE FOR, AND THIS ARTIST HAS ACHIEVED IT, IT DOESN\u0027T MATTER IF THE WHOLE WORLD DOESN\u0027T APPRECIATE HIM OR THEM ( THE TEAM) INFECT THATS THE PROOF THAT THE ARTISTS DIDN\u0027T COMPROMISE IN THE BOLDNESS OF THERE EXPRESSION ( IN SHORT DIDN\u0027T BECOME GAY). WHENEVER I LISTENED TO MUSIC in my 1000 watt music system I listened to this song as well. This is a positive song if one has the level of understanding the level of consciousness . I m feeling great that I could comment and communicate my words to the artists. You( the artists) did it.👏👏👏and respect.",

  "O Outro Lado do Paraíso Quando eu era jovem e ingênua Meu amor partiu para se tornar uma estrela do rock and roll Ele me disse: Por favor, não se preocupe Pequeno sorriso sábio que transmitia tanta segurança Ele comprou uma passagem só de ida Para o oeste, onde eles fazem sucesso Seis crianças presas em um apartamento minúsculo Para as riquezas à beira da piscina ao sol Ele conheceu uma garota que usava Versace Casacos de penas rosa e joias extravagantes Ia ser uma sensação no basquete Ele ia ser o próximo Hakeem Olajuwon Ele tem um Camaro dourado Ele disse através do telefone público Eu tento me manter calma, mas Minha vida parece passar em câmera lenta Adeus, baby blue Eu queria que você pudesse ver a terrível verdade Preso em uma corrida, isso está te matando Gritando para o sol que você sopra Enrolados em um abraço quando éramos nós Dedos cerrados como se você pudesse fugir Eu me contento com um fantasma que nunca conheci O paraíso perfeito que eu segurei Mas eu me contento com um fantasma De onde eu vim em NOLA Ninguém sobrou para se tornar uma estrela do rock and roll Ele ficaria e cuidaria de sua dama Daria tudo para seu novo bebê Sinto saudades dele, você não me culpa Aquele rapaz enlouqueceu completamente Preso na luxúria das câmeras Ele está perseguindo aquele sonho bobo Eu sei que você não sabe, mas eu Eu sei que você não sabe, mas eu ainda tento Meu trovão o derrubou Meu trovão veio e o derrubou Aquela garota se foi, mas eu Aquela garota se foi, mas eu ainda tento Acho que acabou agora A bala atingiu, mas talvez não Eu me sinto tão malditamente entorpecida Isso atinge minha cabeça e eu me sinto entorpecida Meu corpo parece errado Meu corpo parece errado Meu corpo parece errado Adeus, baby blue Eu queria que você pudesse ver a terrível verdade Preso em uma corrida, isso está te matando Gritando para o sol que você sopra Enrolados em um abraço quando éramos nós Dedos cerrados como se você pudesse fugir Eu me contento com um fantasma que nunca conheci O paraíso perfeito que eu segurei Mas eu me contento com um fantasma",
