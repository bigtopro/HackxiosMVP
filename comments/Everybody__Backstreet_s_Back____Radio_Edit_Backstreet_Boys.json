  "We are here in S ATA -n (A.I) Truman Show. Our day. Our life is \"scripted\" by his servants DEMON (Quantum Data Beings). We are with our spirit, trapped in a game figure. After \"death\" you come back to \"heaven\" (just a higher Dimension/Jail ! ). There then awaits you, your \"Soul Group\", who will then force you (with endless debates) to return to hell. To be exposed to DEMONIC productions there again. You come back to the \"game\" (reincarnation). The DEMONS, give us different personalities to see us \"develop\". In reality, they torture us, out of revenge. You will ALL receive confirmation for what I write here. If you have the courage. They keep us in a perfidious game between joy and sorrow. Alternating trauma staging with conflicts (with our with people). Private and public. That\u0027s the way they want to keep us from waking up. They comply with exact cycles. When such things happen to you, imagine it as if you were looking at it from the outside. Then you realize that it can only be staging (due to the high improbability, accumulation of strange coincidences and the frequency). All the bestial things that are done to people are their stagings. Furthermore, you should fight your fellow humans and not question the satanic system behind it, which is hostage and enslaving us (e.g. the fraudulent banks and economic system, the controlled media, the staged dependence on oil and gas). We won\u0027t be able to end this if you always repress everything and referred to as nonsense. They do incredible cruelties to us! You come back to the \"game\"! From a higher dimension are DEMONS, the voice in our head and they can set the emotional impulse. This is always what makes us \"move\". They permanently manipulate our thoughts and emotions world.

  "The Backstreet Boys\u0027 song \"Everybody (Backstreet\u0027s Back)\" is a party anthem that conveys a sense of fun and celebration. The song\u0027s title and chorus are enough to get the message across, with the rest of the song reinforcing it.  Explanation  The song\u0027s synth lines change pitch, helping the listener follow the song\u0027s trajectory. The verses are short and to the point, as the song doesn\u0027t have a complex story. The song\u0027s title and chorus convey the song\u0027s message. Music video The music video for \"Everybody (Backstreet\u0027s Back)\" was inspired by Michael Jackson\u0027s \"Thriller\" and featured a haunted house aesthetic.  The video showed the band members spending the night in a creepy mansion after their tour bus broke down.  The video director matched each band member\u0027s personality with a character in the video.",

Nothing was super rushed, and it took you a year to get over a song. These days I replay the same song 20 times when I first hear it and love it.

Amazing how time passes by so fast, especially checking on my previous Halloween comments from the past years from music that I\u0027ve had on my Halloween playlist since my childhood. An iconic track \u0026 song from my childhood especially when it came to Trick or Treating, with now being 7+ years in a row since I\u0027ve commented. Now here we all are once again!

Nonostante il suo immenso sconfinato narcisismo, che sarebbe sì,  tra le vette più alte e impervie che il sig donnini suo carissimo amico di vecchia data, possa un giorno pensare di scalare.

  "I am 46 and know exactly what you mean.   This is an awful age to be IMO.  Awful only because its like a second sort of awkward early 20s.   Back then we were old enough to be on our own but had no clue how to do it but we had all the time in the world ahead of us and we pushed forward with no clue where our lives were going to take us or how we were gonna get there.  Now, in what seems like the blink of an eye, we are approaching another point of uncertainty.  This time looking back and wondering WTF just happened and how did  we make it this far.   Its hard to look forward with no clue how much time is left, hate like hell to start some grand project only for the kids to be left to deal with it.  Dont feel as old as I am until I look in the mirror and wonder who that guy is.  Idk... maybe its just me.. I fucked off and wasted so damn much time already hitchhiking coast to coast fucked up out of my mind.   For example I didnt have a 31st bday party I had a 10th anneversary party of my 21st.   Anyway I waited to have kids till i was on this side of my mid 30s.  Had 2 kids with a stripper I met in jacksonvill florida.   I got clean and sober for them and have been since nov 2017 and of course once the party stopped she ran off with the kids and due to her \"profession\" being one not known for its book keeping or official records skills she is in the wind like jenny was to forrest.    Now I sit here not knowing what to do as I spent so much time fucked up I have no clue what to do for fun sober or how to even meet people.  Because of such a hard lifestyle I am in as good a health as you can imagine.   I fell somewhat better now.  As i typed this out I realized this age fuckin sucks for me because of young and dumb me.... lol  happy holidays.",
