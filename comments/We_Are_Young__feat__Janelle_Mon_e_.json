  "A Song for My Idealistic - Optimistic Father and My Pragmatic - Realistic Mother. They are both almost the same age and have known each other since junior high school even though they never went to the same school. During college, Dad studied Graphic Design while Mom studied Economics. To make a long story short, they finally got married legally even though many relatives opposed it because of their different economic status and background (Mom-from a rich and more homogeneous family \u0026 Dad-from an ordinary family, even though his grandparents were rich, and more diverse), but they didn\u0027t really care because they got married legally and had relied on each other for a long time, even though they were half isolated. One year after their marriage, they were blessed with a son (me) and five years after my birth, a daughter (my sister) was born. They played a good role as parents and sent their children to top schools and to one of the best universities in my country despite all their limitations. They also became one of the most respected by their extended family and people because of their intelligence, expertise, kindness, and politeness in addition to their older age. unfortunately, it also made some relatives and other people jealous. then because of one and many things and various internal - external conflicts and pressure-attacks from the extended family and outside parties, especially my mother who is from a wealthy family, so they almost divorced a few years ago because the pressure of the problem was too heavy (until Mother\u0027s uterus had problems due to stress and failed to have a third child) and almost lost their love. But because of God\u0027s Will, both of them who are actually still very loyal and love each other and their families, mediation from their children especially me (to the point that I became the \"head of the family\" temporarily in difficult times and also because my sister was far from the center of the conflict because she was studying and working in another city far away), and support from relatives who were mostly out of town, then we were able to get through the storm and resolve the problems gradually. They also decided to move to my sister\u0027s city, start a new life escorted by my sister and good relatives, and \"forced\" to sever ties with the extended family, relatives, and people who had proven toxic for years. I\u0027m alone in this city because my business here is not finished yet and also as an \"anchor\" of control if we want to return to this city. Besides, my city is actually very comfortable to live in. I myself have also almost never met those toxic people even though we are still in the same city area. Now their marriage is almost 30 years old and so far it has improved and is getting along again. They also understand each other and align their characters and egos with each other. At least they are happy now.",

  "Mình và chồng yêu nhau từ năm thứ nhất đại học. Lúc ấy, chồng mình là bộ đội mới xa nhà, còn mình cũng như con chim non mới rời tổ để học bay. Bố mất sớm, mẹ đi nước ngoài để có tiền cho mình học tiếp. Mình gặp anh ấy giống như \"love in the first sight\". Sau đó mình hỏi ra thì chồng cũng yêu mình là người đầu tiên giống mình yêu anh. Chớp mắt đã 16 năm, chúng mình có 1 gia đình nhỏ với 3 bé. Cảm ơn anh vì đã luôn bên cạnh và yêu thương mình, giờ có lẽ thương nhiều hơn yêu. Mong sau này cuộc sống bình yên để mình được bên cạnh những người thương yêu ❤.",
