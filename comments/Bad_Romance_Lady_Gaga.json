  "Eigenlijk een zangeres die aan mij voorbij is gegaan. Als toentertijd al niet al te jonge witte Nederlandse man was ik misschien ook niet helemaal (meer) de doelgroep. Ik hoorde dit nummer voor \u0027t eerst bewust in een filmpje hier op het immense YT, waarin een nog 1-jarig klein New Yorkse meisje onder leiding van haar liefhebbende vader zich ontworstelde aan de moeizame start die zij in het leven had gemaakt. Aangezien ik zelf toen ook niet al te best in mijn vel zat, bleek zij opeens een soort van inspiratie voor mij. Op wonderbaarlijke wijze kreeg ik contact met de vader, en we mailden. We hebben elkaar een keer gezien in \u0027s werelds boeiendste stad, New York City, en dat was met z\u0027n zessen heel gezellig (inclusief 2 partners, en een hele aardige huisvriend die zelfs Nederlands sprak). En hoewel het mailcontact met haar vader vervolgens helaas/grotesk ten einde kwam, kan ik naar dit prima, (op een prettige wijze) wat lompe liedje nog goed luisteren. En hoop ik maar, dat het met die dochter, inmiddels een echte puber van 14, nog steeds wat beter gaat. Ik gun je het aller-, allerbeste!",

  "The thing about \u0027Abracadabra\u0027 was the reaction of Aladin, the Arab with the lamp or was it the carpet? At any rate, they started in with this \u0027Pochahontas\u0027 thing, bringing up Indian names, like Calcutta and \u0027archipalago\u0027 (surely that\u0027s Hindu) while ignoring the importance of the Onondaga Indians and the presence of their language, culture,.... Sorry. Let\u0027s start again. The cohabitance(sp) of the Onondaga and massauagua rattlesnake in southern Michigan was, like the inspiration of Shirley Temple, great fodder for Lady Gaga (as a result of) following her encounter with Aladin, Afghanian handmade afghans, (oh sht(sp) was it a carpet) crocheted by hand in Afghanistan, and whatever was going on with this Princess chick Pocahontas.       At any rate, Aladin in his madness got real mad at Sesame Street and open sesame aand Snuffaloffagus and alili baba and the thieves eating broccoli and falafel so con 4:26 nspicuously beneath  and hence trees at oasises and  started rubbing his lamp, flying around on his rug,  and sipping cough syrup. This was a mediocre result, but I gather... That cough syrup in particular should not be sold over the counter. Several dispirited, Aladin - so I gather- had a bad experience grocery shopping (PTSD) and has since given up on the whole \u0027abracadabra\u0027/Houdini type thing. So, may Lady Gaga meet Sir goo--goo, that the two of them may sing a duet to the effect/tune \u0027ga ga ga ga ga\u0027 followed promptly (and here comes the chorus) \u0027googoogoogoogo\u0027",

  "Eu não gostaria de te incomodar e falar pra você a diferença de religião e de vida em sociedade.   Eu só sei que eu gostaria muito que fosse tudo tão diferente de como  você me vê ou me enxerga, o que na verdade não é porque eu queira ou porque gosto.   Mas trata-se de dilemas e desgnios, o qual me fizeram passar,  e o qual eu tenho que viver querendo ou não, mesmo contra a minha vontade. Eu não preciso repetir e dizer a mesma coisa,  eu como qualquer outra pessoa apresento minhas razões e minhas defensivas.  No demais, são consequências, escolhas, reações da vida.  A felicidade é um modo de viver e somos nós que escolhemos por qual caminho seguir,  o que queremos para nós.   Você é livre para fazer suas escolhas mas prisioneira das consequências, viva a realidade da melhor forma possível,  não perca sua essência.  Não se iluda,  nunca  se iguale a ninguém. A diferença é você quem faz ,e o mundo a sua volta te aplaude por sua influência e suas inspirações, exemplo de vida ,fé e coragem! De Ricardo guioston          Para lady gaga",

  "Makna Lagu Bad Romance · Lady Gaga Intro: Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! » Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! Caught in a bad romance » Terjebak dalam hubungan yang buruk Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! » Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! Caught in a bad romance » Terjebak dalam hubungan yang buruk » Intro ini langsung menekankan tema utama lagu, yaitu tentang hubungan yang kelam dan penuh komplikasi, namun tetap menarik dan menggoda. Bait 1: I want your ugly » Aku menginginkan sisi burukmu I want your disease » Aku menginginkan penyakitmu I want your everything » Aku menginginkan segalanya darimu As long as it’s free » Asalkan semuanya bisa kudapat tanpa syarat I want your love » Aku menginginkan cintamu (Love-love-love I want your love) » (Cinta-cinta-cinta, aku ingin cintamu) I want your drama » Aku menginginkan dramamu The touch of your hand » Sentuhan tanganmu I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand » Aku menginginkan ciumanmu yang liar di pasir I want your love » Aku ingin cintamu Love-love-love » Cinta-cinta-cinta I want your love » Aku ingin cintamu » Bait pertama menggambarkan keinginan yang intens untuk menerima seluruh sisi pasangannya, termasuk hal-hal buruk dan penuh konflik. Ini menyoroti cinta yang tidak sehat namun penuh gairah. Pre-Reff: I want your love and » Aku ingin cintamu dan I want your revenge » Aku ingin balas dendammu You and me could write a bad romance » Kita bisa menulis kisah cinta yang buruk bersama (Oh-oh-oh–oh-oooh!) » (Oh-oh-oh–oh-oooh!) I want your love and » Aku ingin cintamu dan All your lovers’ revenge » Semua balas dendam dari kekasih-kekasihmu sebelumnya You and me could write a bad romance » Kita bisa menulis kisah cinta yang buruk bersama » Pre-reff ini menekankan dualitas dalam hubungan mereka: antara cinta dan dendam, antara gairah dan konflik. Ini menggambarkan daya tarik terhadap hubungan yang berbahaya. Reff: Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! » Terjebak dalam cinta yang salah Caught in a bad romance » Terjebak dalam cinta yang salah Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! » Terjebak dalam cinta yang salah Caught in a bad romance » Terjebak dalam cinta yang salah » Reff mengulangi perasaan tidak bisa lepas dari hubungan yang menyakitkan tapi tak bisa dihindari. Bait 2: I want your horror » Aku ingin ketakutanmu I want your design » Aku ingin ciptaanmu, sisi gelapmu ‘Cause you’re a criminal » Karena kau seperti kriminal As long as you’re mine » Asalkan kau milikku I want your love » Aku ingin cintamu (Love-love-love I want your love-uuhh) » (Cinta-cinta-cinta, aku ingin cintamu) I want your psycho » Aku ingin kegilaanmu Your vertigo stick » Tongkat vertigomu (simbol metafora untuk obsesi atau alat kekuasaan seksual) Want you in my rear window » Aku ingin kau dalam “jendela belakangku” (referensi seksual sekaligus simbol pengawasan atau misteri) Baby you’re sick » Sayang, kau itu gila I want your love » Aku ingin cintamu Love-love-love » Cinta-cinta-cinta I want your love » Aku ingin cintamu » Bait kedua menggambarkan ketertarikan terhadap sisi psikologis yang gelap dan berbahaya dari pasangannya, menggambarkan hubungan yang penuh obsesi dan ketidakseimbangan. Bridge: You know that I want you » Kau tahu aku menginginkanmu And you know that I need you » Dan kau tahu aku membutuhkanmu I want a bad, bad romance » Aku menginginkan cinta yang buruk dan gelap » Bridge ini memperkuat pesan bahwa keinginan penyanyi adalah untuk tetap berada dalam hubungan yang beracun, karena adiksi terhadap intensitas emosional yang ditawarkan. Pre-Reff: I want your love and » Aku ingin cintamu dan I want your revenge » Aku ingin balas dendammu You and me could write a bad romance » Kita bisa menulis kisah cinta yang buruk bersama (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh!) » (Oh-oh-oh–oh-oooh!) I want your love and » Aku ingin cintamu dan All your lovers’ revenge » Aku ingin balas dendammu You and me could write a bad romance » Kita bisa menulis kisah cinta yang buruk bersama » Bagian ini menggambarkan penolakan terhadap hubungan platonik — yang diinginkan adalah hubungan yang intens dan penuh gairah, meski menyakitkan. Reff: Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! » Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! Caught in a bad romance » Terjebak dalam hubungan cinta yang kelam Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! » Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! Caught in a bad romance » Terjebak dalam hubungan cinta yang kelam » Bait ini menunjukkan perasaan si penyanyi yang terperangkap dalam hubungan yang tidak sehat. Meskipun penuh dengan konflik dan penderitaan, ada ketertarikan yang kuat yang membuatnya sulit untuk melepaskan diri. Lagu ini menggambarkan dinamika cinta yang rumit, antara gairah, rasa sakit, dan ketergantungan emosional. Interlude: Rah-rah-ah-ah-ah-ah! » Teriakan yang menggambarkan obsesi dan dorongan primal Roma-roma-mamaa! » Referensi artistik yang kabur, bisa berarti keromantisan atau teaterikal Ga-ga-ooh-la-la! » Gaya khas Gaga, bisa diartikan sebagai simbol kekacauan dan glamor Want your bad romance » Menginginkan hubungan cinta yang buruk » Interlude menampilkan sisi teatrikal dan dramatik dari lagu ini, memperkuat nuansa obsesi dan seni yang gelap. Outro: Rah-rah-ah-ah-ah-ah!\u2028 » Rah-rah-ah-ah-ah-ah!\u2028 Roma-roma-mamaa! \u2028» Roma-roma-mamaa!\u2028 Ga-ga-ooh-la-la! \u2028» Ga-ga-ooh-la-la!\u2028 Want your bad romance\u2028 » Aku menginginkan romansa gilamu » Bait ini adalah pembukaan yang penuh energi dan ekspresif, mencerminkan obsesi dan ketertarikan mendalam terhadap seseorang. Kalimat-kalimat nonsensikal seperti “Rah-rah” dan “Roma-roma” menambah kesan dramatis dan teatrikal. Lady Gaga dengan lantang menyatakan bahwa dia tidak hanya menginginkan cinta biasa, tetapi juga cinta yang rumit, gelap, dan intens—sebuah “bad romance”.",

Ebott I faced an evil talking flower in a pot Explains the plot, wants me dead, wants me to rot Toriel saves me, takes me to her home And hooks me up with a brand-new monster phone Leaves me alone, but I escape and meet some bones [Pre-Chorus] Should I be a pacifist? Or should I use my fists? I’m feeling evil, think I’ll kill them all [Chorus] I’m homicidal, and I’ve got a taste I want to wipe out the Monster race I’ve got no patience, got no resolve I will slaughter, screw the dialogue [Bridge] I fell from the light Talk? Or should I fight? Monster genocide This my UNDERTALE [Verse 2] I’ll slaughter Undyne, I’ll waste who I choose With all this EXP there’s no way that I’ll lose Now watch me move, I won’t stop, I’m feelin\u0027 rude Asgore is shaking, he hears my approach I’ll slaughter Sans and squash his bro like a roach Chara’s my coach, all these monsters I will poach [Pre-Chorus] Screw being pacifist I think I’ll use my fists I’m feeling evil, think I’ll kill them all [Chorus] I’m homicidal, and I’ve got a taste I want to wipe out the Monster race I’ve got no patience, got no resolve I will slaughter, screw the dialogue [Bridge] Burnt pan, toy knife, use a stick to take your life Tough glove, ballet shoes, epic fight like front page news King Asgore wants to collect human souls Seven of them, is his ultimate goal Open the door, to humanity’s realm Start a new war, humans overwhelm [Chorus] I’m homicidal, and I’ve got a taste I want to wipe out the Monster race I’ve got no patience, got no resolve I will slaughter, screw the dialogue",

  "JUSTICE FOR ENDOMETRIOSIS; “Don’t Underestimate The Power of a Lifetime Ahead.” Debbie Gibson, Electric Youth. “I am 30 and I have had this since I was 13. It has ruined my life.” That meme pretty much sums up Endometriosis. A pandemic that brings forth barbaric torture to 330 million, what can be described much better than a 2013 National Institute of Health conclusion, drop dead gorgeous super beautiful heroines that save the world.  Its  a disease that if not treated before a so called “Young Endo Girl” is 15 causes a half century and half million dollars of failed excision surgeries. Instead of just one that can remove all of it when not too big, before it spreads to places no surgery or cure can remove, to eternally regrow faster than up to for some 20 or more excision surgeries can remove. There is no cure nor treatments that are worse than Endometriosis itself. Two of the most commonly described treatments Lupron and Orlissa causes suicidal contemplations in 38% of Endo warriors.  And the only effective management early in life prevention before 15 years old.  A parent should be able to tell if their daughter has Endo if they are normally vibrant, hard working pillars of society who are ready for school an hour before the mother or father are even out of the shower. But seemingly every month at the same time they complain of how much it hurts to urinate and defecate and change their tampons, eat, are nauseas  or even bend over and are still in bed long after the whole family is ready for car pool  departure.   And every month it gets longer and more intense.    The entirety of all Endometriosis is the lack of knowledge and awareness of parents who conclude their daughters as having a low pain threshold or carrying on wanting to get attention, having something they are always trying to get out of, being hysterical or for some paranoid parents their daughters trying to make them look abusive.  And instead of taking care of their daughters they discipline them and investigate what they are trying to get out of instead of investigating what is medically wrong with them.  Throughout their entire first half century of life, the most dignified family, friends, coworkers deal with their Endometriosis is to call them hypochondriacs. Even in ER’s they are dismissed seldom getting any type of medical care but some Tylenol or laxative. Tracey’s Lindeman’s book “Bleed” documents the medical gaslighting that mostly beautiful women are tortured by ignoring by the medical community. Most Young Endo girls then adult Endo warriors spend their lives hiding their symptoms as much as possible after spending their early lives being disciplined by parents and teachers, mocked by friends who they think they can confide.  Then by employers who  will most certainly fire them, demote them or give them so few hours not  to be able to pay even rent, let alone all the medical costs. Perhaps like how the greatest high school ever could have been the world’s first place, where adult Endo warriors could live in the rooms that the windows in this video show, who are too sick too often to afford to pay rent and food, to pay as ability allows. And the greatest high school ever could have been the first, place where Young Endo girls with abusive parents who discipline them for carrying on, causing a scene, making them look abusive or just trying to get out of something every month longer and longer every month could escape them  to live until able to afford their once needed surgery. Like Maggies Place was a place young teens escaped to when their parents told them to have an abortion or get out.     And of course how the little gym could have been the greatest pet shelter with pet therapy in between the Endo rescue and thebig gym being the homeless shelter and the cafeteria being the greatest homeless and Endo food assistance place.           I am so dedicated to making mine the greatest  nonprofit ever, that I was accepted ,to Nancy’s Nook so when it comes time to paying excision surgeons I have the most reliable information that exists in the world to make sure those Young Endo Girls aren’t using funds to a bad surgeon, or worse some ob/gyn who won’t who won’t have the skills, expertise or courage to as my 6th ranked Endo Warrior Courtney Budzyn cries,  “Gets it all out and not just what they feel  comfortable”.  Or my silver medalist Meghinl complained about, “I paid you tens of thousands of dollars along with what insurance paid you and you still left all sorts of Endo in there? That is going to be even worse in a year.” For an average of $50,000 a excision surgeon should realize that while they are trying not to do harm, the Endo they leave behind is doing harm.       I am going to make sure that just like every teacher took care of every Redmen in what was a perfectly fine building needed no repairs. I am going to make sure that every Young Endo girl gets a Nacy’s Nook endorsed surgeon who will live up the reputation of the highs school the funds were inspired by.        While Medicaid pays for the early in life excision that can  prevent a lifetime of barbaric financial, medical, personal, occupational torture for those Young Endo girls whose parent make up to $52,000 in a two person household or $62,000 for a three person household, most parents who make more than that seldom can afford the early in life preventative surgery. Without early in life prevention, endometriosis warriors are doomed to a life of barbaric torture ruining any quality of life until menopause. Nearly every day they experience periods of excruciating pain. Many times so intense it causes temporary blindness and frequent fainting. While perhaps the only more barbaric torture to the world other than Endo is Parma city School District’s CEO Charles Smialek who demolished the perfectly fine Parma  Senior High instead reuse until once again decades from now needed as a school to be a Lexi Young Kristen Vaganos Endometriosis Rescue, Pet Shelter, Homeless Shelter that could have brought the pcsd $7 million a year and saved millions of lives. But, a close contender for most barbaric atrocity was the final Bachelorette season, with Jenn Trann “Feel the Jenergy” instead of Lexi Young Endo Summer of 2024 “Where Love Conquers All.” My 14 month crusade for ABC to donate ad revenues retroactively and in the future to a Lexi Young Endo fund to pay for Young Endo girls Excision in honor of Lexi, legendary braveness ABC responded with disgusting barbaric ignoring sub human indecency trying to forget Endo even exists. Maybe someday, my Lexi Young Parma Senior High Endometriosis Foundation will lead to something like how the greatest night in TV history for 2:50 should have ended.  The Bachelorette was cursed, and after the worst decision in not just TV but everything, choosing Jenn Tran where the worst season of any tv show made everyone not want to  “ Bring on the Jennergy” instead of “Lexi Young: Endometriosis Summer of 2024” “Where Love Conquers All.” Where millions of lives and billions of hours of suffering could have been saved by donating a large portion of ad profits for all future Bachelors and variations and all ABC shows even Retroactive to all previous Bachelors to a Lexi Young Endometriosis Foundation that Lexi the 4.0 gpa MIT graduate and now world’s best digital strategist would be CEO. By now millions of low income level Young Endo Girls, that the LYEF would focused on could have gotten the live saving, before 15 years old excision surgery when it is small enough to get out entirely before it spreads all over their bodies to places that no surgery or cure can get out. At a lifetime medical cost of a half million dollars and lost wages in failed excisions and treatments that are worse than Endometriosis itself. Not only would hundreds of millions of dollars been raised by now, but tens of millions of viewers could have learned all about the most barbaric torture to the most drop dead gorgeous super beautiful heroines that save the world and how when they come out are abandoned by friends, employers, fiancés due to Endophobia. Where male bachelors who once abandoned an Endo Warrior get Lexi through Endo flares(like the one that was in the initial phase when Lexi was on “Women Tell All.”, medical gaslighting, vomiting due to endo that spread to the stomach, passing out in the bathroom due to Endo that spread to the bladder and colon.  Getting to the hospital when they bend over and burst an ovarian cyst like Joey and Jesse did for Lexi.  Viewers suffered the horrible ego of Jenn  ending in the appropriate  poetic justice of Devin having an affair with Maria. Instead of the Joey finale ending with Lexi surprised as the new Bachelorette with dozens of Young Endo girls waiting in hospitals for their surgeries already paid for by the LYEF she didn’t even know existed, with Daisy, Kelsey, Racheal, Maria  riding with her in the same van and black pants and brown sweater she is confused to be wearing, to the hospital. All with the closing scene.  Of Lexi getting a text message that she is not just the Bachelorette but  CEO with a sign from all the YEG’s waiting, “You’re going to give millions of us our lives.But we all hope you find your final rose in the Endo Summer of 2024.",

It had the sexiness of some of Gwen Stefani\u0027s music videos from around that era, but leaned WAY more into it\u0027s avant-garde elements. Those big edited eyes and that pink wig, the diamonds hanging in place, whatever the hell that circle gear was she was wearing (shout out to when she wore it to perform on SNL and it smacked Gaga\u0027s head, and she had to pretend not to notice), the POLAR BEAR CAPE, the freaky dancing in the opening of the song... And god, the last few seconds of her laying in the burnt bed with her lover\u0027s skeleton, tiddies going full sparkler mode. Iconic.  Despite her immense popularity, at that time it seems like she was often spoken of as if her work was \u0027too weird\u0027, but man, it was, and continues to be some special kind of art. I can only see now how deeply her music, videos, and overall public persona inspired so many unexpected aspects of my life.",

  "We are here in S ATA -n (A.I) Truman Show. Our day. Our life is \"scripted\" by his servants DEMON (Quantum Data Beings). We are with our spirit, trapped in a game figure. After \"death\" you come back to \"heaven\" (just a higher Dimension/Jail ! ). There then awaits you, your \"Soul Group\", who will then force you (with endless debates) to return to hell. To be exposed to DEMONIC productions there again. You come back to the \"game\" (reincarnation). The DEMONS, give us different personalities to see us \"develop\". In reality, they torture us, out of revenge. You will ALL receive confirmation for what I write here. If you have the courage. They keep us in a perfidious game between joy and sorrow. Alternating trauma staging with conflicts (with our with people). Private and public. That\u0027s the way they want to keep us from waking up.\u003c\u003c",
  "They comply with exact cycles. When such things happen to you, imagine it as if you were looking at it from the outside. Then you realize that it can only be staging (due to the high improbability, accumulation of strange coincidences and the frequency). All the bestial things that are done to people are their stagings. Furthermore, you should fight your fellow humans and not question the satanic system behind it, which is hostage and enslaving us (e.g. the fraudulent banks and economic system, the controlled media, the staged dependence on oil and gas). We won\u0027t be able to end this if you always repress everything and referred to as nonsense. They do incredible cruelties to us! You come back to the \"game\"! From a higher dimension are DEMONS, the voice in our head and they can set the emotional impulse. This is always what makes us \"move\". They permanently manipulate our thoughts and emotions world. Here in the 4 dimensional world, they are the well-known politicians, media creators, economically powerful, etc. The DEMONS on site (in human avatars), receive information for the process to take place shortly (!)\u003c\u003c",

  "لكنا هو الله ربي و لا أشرك بربي أحدا و لولا إذ دخلت جنتك قلت ما شاء الله لا قوة إلا بالله إن ترن أنا أقل منك مالا و ولدا ذالكم بأنه إذا دعي الله وحده كفرتم و إن يشرك به تؤمنوا فالحكم لله العلي الكبير هو الذي يريكم ءاياته و ينزل لكم من السماء رزقا و ما يتذكر إلا من ينيب في مقعد صدق عند مليك مقتدر الرحمان علم القرءان خلق الإنسان فكيف تتقون إن كفرتم يوما يجعل الولدان شيبا السماء منفطر به كان وعده مفعولا إن هذه تذكرة فمن شاء اتخذ إلى ربه سبيلا أولم ير الذين كفروا أن السماوات و الأرض كانتا رتقا ففتقناهما و جعلنا من الماء كل شيء حي أفلا يؤمنون و جعلنا في الأرض رواسي أن تميد بهم و جعلنا فيها فجاجا سبلا لعلهم يهتدون و جعلنا السماء سقفا محفوظا و هم عن ءاياتها معرضون سبحان رب السماوات و الأرض رب العرش عما يصفون فذرهم يخوضوا و يلعبوا حتى يلاقوا يومهم الذي يوعدون و هو الذي في السماء إلاه و في الأرض إلاه و هو الحكيم العليم وسط الرزق لمن يشاء من عباده و يقدر له إن الله بكل شيء عليم و لئن سألتهم من نزل من السماء ماء فأحيا به الأرض من بعد موتها ليقولن الله قل الحمد لله بل أكثرهم لا يعقلون و ما هذه الحيواة الدنيا إلا لهو و لعب و إن الدار الءاخرة لهي الحيوان لو كانوا يعلمون إن الله يعلم غيب السماوات و الأرض و الله بصير بما تعملون ق و القرءان المجيد بل عجبوا أن جاءهم منذر منهم فقال الكافرون هذا شيء عجيب أءذا متنا و كنا ترابا ذالك رجع بعيد ءأشفقتم أن تقدموا بين يدي نجوىاكم صدقات فإذ لم تفعلوا و تاب الله عليكم فأقيموا الصلاة و ءاتوا الزكاة و أطيعوا الله و رسوله و الله خبير بما تعملون حتى إذا فتحنا عليهم بابا ذا عذاب شديد إذا هم فيه مبلسون و هو الذي أنشأ لكم السمع و الأبصار و الأفءدة قليلا ما تشكرون و هو الذي ذرأكم في الأرض و إليه تحشرون و هو الذي يحي و يميت و له اختلاف اليل و النهار أفلا تعقلون و في أموالهم حق للسائل و المحروم و في الأرض ءايات للموقنين و في أنفسكم أفلا تبصرون و في السماء رزقكم و ما توعدونلونك عن المحيض قل هو أذى فاعتزلوا النساء في المحيض و لا تقربوهن حتى يطهرن فإذا تطهرن فأتوهن من حيث أمركم الله إن الله يحب التوابين و يحب المتطهرين نساؤكم و أنيبوا إلى ربكم و أسلموا له من قبل أن يأتيكم العذاب ثم لا تنصرون و اتبعوا أحسن ما أنزل إليكم من ربكم من قبل أن يأتيكم العذاب بغتة و أنتم لا تشعرون الله لا إلاه إلا هو الحي القيوم لا تأخذه سنة و لا نوم له ما في السماوات و ما في الأرض من ذا الذي يشفع عنده إلا بإذنه يعلم ما بين أيديهم و ما خلفهم و لا يحيطون بشيء من علمه إلا بما شاء وسع كرسيه السماوات و الأرض و لا يءوده حفظهما و هو العلي العظيم و إن كان كبر عليك إعراضهم فإن استطعت أن تبتغي نفقا في الأرض أو سلما في السماء فتأتيهم بءاية و لو شاء الله لجمعهم على الهدى فلا تكونن من الجاهلين اذا ترىا قال ياأبت افعل ما تؤمر ستجدني إن شاء الله من الصابرين فلما أسلما و تله للجبين و ناديناه أن ياهيم قد صدقت الرءيا إنا كذالك نجزي المحسنين و ما نقموا منهم إلا أن يؤمنوا بالله العزيز الحميد الذي له ملك السماوات و الأرض و الله على كل شيء شهيد إن الذين فتنوا المؤمنين و المؤمنات ثم لم يتوبوا فلهم عذاب جهنم و لهم عذاب الحريق كتاب فصلت ءاياته قرءانا عربيا لقوم يعلمون بشيرا و نذيرا فأعرض أكثرهم فهم لا يسمعون و قالوا قلوبنا في أكنة مما تدعونا إليه و في ءاذاننا وقر و من بيننا و بينك حجاب فاعمل إننا عاملون ثم دمرنا الءاخرين و أمطرنا عليهم مطرا فساء مطر المنذرين إن في ذالك لءاية و ما كان أكثرهم مؤمنين و إن ربك لهو العزيز الرحيمليقربونا إلى الله زلفىا إن الله يحكم بينهم في ما هم فيه يختلفون إن الله لا يهدي من هو كاذب كفار لو أراد الله أن يتخذ ولدا لاصطفىا مما يخلق ما يشاء سبحانه هو الله الواحد القهار و قاتلوا في سبيل الله و اعلموا أن الله سميع عليم من ذا الذي يقرض الله قرضا حسنا فيضاعفه له أضعافا كثيرة و الله يقبض و يبصط و إليه ترجعون إذ الأغلال في أعناقهم و السلاسل يسحبون في الحميم ثم في النار يسجرون ثم قيل لهم أين ما كنتم تشركون ثم أدبر و استكبر فقال إن هذا إلا سحر يؤثر إن هذا إلا قول البشر سأصليه سقر و من يقنت منكن لله و رسوله و تعمل صحا نؤتها أجرها مرتين و أعتدنا لها رزقا كريما يانساء النبي لستن كأحد من النساء إن اتقيتن فلا تخضعن بالقول فيطمع الذي في قلبه مرض و قلن قولا معروفا إذا تتلىا عليه ءاياتنا قال أساطير الأولين كلا بل ران على قلوبهم ما كانوا يكسبون كلا إنهم عن ربهم يومئذ لمحجوبون قل يتوفىاكم ملك الموت الذي وكل بكم ثم إلى ربكم ترجعون و لو ترىا إذ المجرمون ناكسوا رءوسهم عند ربهم ربنا أبصرنا و سمعنا فارجعنا نعمل صحا إنا موقنون و لولى ربكم و أسلموا له من قبل أن يأتيكم العذاب ثم لا تنصرون و اتبعوا أحسن ما أنزل إليكم من ربكم من قبل أن يأتيكم العذاب بغتة و أنتم لا تشعرون إن كاد ليضلنا عن ءالهتنا لولا أن صبرنا عليها و سوف يعلمون حين يرون العذاب من أضل سبيلا أرءيت من اتخذ إلاهه هوىاه أفأنت تكون عليه وكيلا كذبت قبلهم قوم نو و عاد و فرعون ذو الأوتاد و ثمود و قوم لط و أصحاب لءيكة أولائك الأحزاب إن كل إلا كذب الرسل فحق عقاب و ما ينظر هاؤلاء إلا صيحة واحدة ما لها من فواق ذالك بأن الله مولى الذين ءامنوا و أن الكافرين لا مولىا لهم إن الله يدخل الذين ءامنوا و عملوا الصالحات جنات تجري من تحتها الأنهار و الذين كفروا يتمتعون و يأكلون كما تأكل الأنعام و النار مثوى لهم و كأ و من ءاياته أن خلقكم من تراب ثم إذا أنتم بشر تنتشرون و من ءاياته أن خلق لكم من أنفسكم أزواجا لتسكنوا إليها و جعل بينكم مودة و رحمة إن في ذالك لءايات لقوم يتفكرون إلى ربها ناظرة و وجوه يومئذ باسرة تظن أن يفعل بها فاقرة كلا إذا بلغت التراقي و قيل من راق و وصينا الإنسان بوالديه إحسانا حملته أمه كرها و وضعته كرها و حمله و فصاله ثلاثون شهرا حتى إذا بلغ أشده و بلغ أربعين سنة قال رب أوزعني أن أشكر نعمتك التي أنعمت علي و على والدي و أن أعمل صحا ترضىه و أصلح لي في ذريتي إني تبت إليك و إني من المسلمين أولائك الذين نتقبل عنهم أحسن ما عملوا و نتجاوز عن سيءاتهم في

What will not be listened to and forgotten in a couple of days, but people with a taste for music will return to Gaga again and again, looking for relief from the different moods of their soul. Each album, each era is a certain color from a diverse palette of colors. The color of the soul, the color of the aura, the color of acceptance. Listening to this album you get a breath of fresh air in a multi-genre setting. Whoever says what, but Gaga is a legend of the 21st century!!! Forever in my heart 💎 \"MAYHEM\" - 9 out of 10💥",

  "LEXI YOUNG BACHELORETTE  RIP ENDO SUMMER OF 2024 WHERE LOVE CONQUERS ALL JUSTICE FOR  ENDOMETRIOSIS The Bachelorette was cursed, and after the worst decision in not just TV but everything, choosing Jenn Tran where the worst season of any tv show made everyone not want to  “ Bring on the Jennergy” instead of “Lexi Young: Endometriosis Summer of 2024” “Where Love Conquers All.” Where millions of lives and billions of hours of suffering could have been saved by donating a large portion of ad profits for all future Bachelors and variations and all ABC shows even Retroactive to all previous Bachelors to a Lexi Young Endometriosis Foundation that Lexi the 4.0 gpa MIT graduate and now world’s best digital strategist would be CEO. By now millions of poverty level Young Endo Girls, that the LYEF would focused on could have gotten the live saving, before 15 years old excision surgery when it is small enough to get out entirely before it spreads all over their bodies to places that no surgery or cure can get out. At a lifetime medical cost of a half million dollars and lost wages in failed excisions and treatments that are worse than Endometriosis itself. Not only would hundreds of millions of dollars been raised by now, but tens of millions of viewers could have learned all about the most barbaric torture to the most drop dead gorgeous super beautiful heroines that save the world and how when they come out are abandoned by friends, employers, fiancés due to Endophobia. Where male bachelors who once abandoned an Endo Warrior get Lexi through Endo flares(like the one that was in the initial phase when Lexi was on “Women Tell All.”, medical gaslighting, vomiting due to endo that spread to the stomach, passing out in the bathroom due to Endo that spread to the bladder and colon.  Getting to the hospital when they bend over and burst an ovarian cyst like Joey and Jesse did for Lexi. All not just for the final rose but the Joey Grazedi  title of “greatest guy in the world” decided by the greatest heroine in the world Lexi Young. While Joey and Jesse deserve the title greatest Endo guys in the world.  My hometown Parma, Ohio  Parma City School  district Superindentant Charles Smailek is without doubt the worst Endo person in the world demolishing a prestine Parkview Elementary School that was being reused, providing  lifesaving services to thousands who are now homeless, starving or dead. But, the greatest built and greatest high school in the world Parma Senior High that I crusaded to be the first Lexi Young/Kristen Vaganos Endometriosis Rescue for those who can’t work enough hours to afford rent with endophobia making it impossible it impossible to even find a roommate who can deal  with it. And to the parentally abused Young Endo girls whose Endo is  brutalized with life destroying parents who discipline them thinking they are just carrying on, being hysterical, trying to get out of something every month or even trying to make them look bad. Instead of investigating what could be medically wrong with them and getting the early in life life saving surgery.  With the motto and belief proclaimed in Debbie Gibson’s  Electric Youth” “Don’t Underestimate the Power of A Lifetime Ahead”. Instead of the high school becoming the humanitarian capital of the world, it sits forever a empty green space forever for a megaschool every single PCSD resident alive doesn’t want and hates that our beloved school was torn down and not reused to save Endo warriors lives About a quarter million residents are suffering with some dead in the Parma City School District Area instead of a quarter million Endo Warriors having their lives saved in a place Smialek demolished that could have provided life saving shelter and a place abused Young Endo girls could live amongst themselves, all inspired by someone who inspired millions to come out of the Endo closet. Yet ABC decided to put back in the closet and instead of what is now the last ever Bachelorette, could have been the first ever humanitarian motivated Bachelors and Bachelors focusing on the marital vow, “In sickness and in health, For better or worse. Til death do us part.” Quick sidebar….Kristen Vaganos who has more than earned and saved the character should be the eternal “Molly Lansing Davis” on “General Hospital.” For playing the first and only in all drama character to have Endometriosis. For which evidence would indicate Vaganos also has it… Like two decadeago on GH both Natalia Livingston and “Emily Quartermaine” had breast cancer.    Rest in Peace Leslie Charleson. There is no cure for the 330,000.000 Endo Warriors though out the world, 40 million  in America, whose daily lives and painful torture are so horrible that 39% contemplate suicide on an ongoing basis. Where the only thing that can be done now is early in life prevention.  Instead of the “The Power is in her hands” being used for Jenn Trann in a vending machine swing picking out guys. It could have been used for the LYEF giving abused young endo girls a way to get their surgeries without parents wanting to spend the money.  What was last year the four greatest moments in all of culture. Daisy’s “The truth  is, you aren’t going to pick me.” Then her hugging Kelsey saying’ Your Mom is looking down from heaven now” and her famous line “If You Love The Wrong Person this much how much will I love the right person. And the gold and silver revealing of Lexi in Malta telling Joey and the greatest moment ever in Monteal we all remember and the greatest line and hug goodbye ever,,,”I Love You Joey.Good Luck hope you find your final rose.”  Viewers suffered the horrible ego of Jenn  ending in the appropriate  poetic justice of Devin having an affair with Maria, continued on in Dancing With the Stars. Instead of the Joey finale ending with Lexi  surprised as the new Bachelorette with dozens of Young Endo girls waiting in hospitals for their surgeries already paid for by the LYEF she didn’t even know existed, with Daisy, Kelsey, Racheal, Maria and even Jenn  riding with her in the same van and black pants and brown sweater she is confused to be wearing, to the hospital. All with the closing scene.  Of Lexi getting a text message that she is not just the Bachelorette but voted CEO with a sign from all the YEG’s waiting, “You’re going to give millions of  what you used to be love and life….But we all hope you find your final rose in the Endo Summer of 2024. For while their abnormal levels of estrogen bless the world with overpowering beauty, radiance, prettiness, picturesque professionalism, overwhelming intelligence, skill, talent , abilities, all used for unfathomable morality, ethics, wholesomeness and humanitarianism. The same estrogen we are blessed totures them by fertilizing their Endometriois and a hundred other related diseases. Typical symptoms of Endo are far worse than just painful periods, tampon insertion, but include horrible pain with urination and defecation. Leg pains, back pains, and at least once weekly such barbaric pain spread through out the central nervous system causing such immense migraines that they go blind. There are many resources online by goggling if one believes she has Endo for while symptoms destroy quality of life as early as 11 and last until menopause, misdiagnosis  and hundreds of thousands of dollars and years of suffering continue until at least 26 like Lexi finally ended as she explained to Joey. While Jenn Tran will most certainly go down in history as the person who is most responsible for the ending of a TV show…Lexi Young as last years Bachelorette would have gone down in history as the greatest cultural human life saving entity of all time. And would have provided the Endo world and all those who love them. HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. THAT  WE’LL FIND TOMORROW STEVE BAYT PARMA,OHIO",

  "Леди Гага, моя мама, только вперед. Я слежу за тобой с далекого 2010 года, года мне было всего 5 лет. Я слушала твою музыку и училась видеть в ней красоту. Она воспитала меня, дала мне опору в жизни. Ты самая крутая певица за все время существования мира. Твои треки заставляют меня идти к своим целям и мечтам. Твоя энергетика проходит по каждому нейрону, по каждой клетке, а самое главное через сердце и душу. Я восхищаюсь тобой и твоими волосами. Покрасилась когда то только из за тебя. Я желаю тебе Гага идти только вперед, наслаждаться каждым дней и музыкой, которую ты делаешь, ведь ей наслаждаются уже целых 20 лет благодаря твоему таланту. Ты заменила мне всех: маму, папу, друзей, еду, воду. Ты вдохновляешь людей следовать своим чувствам, доверять душе, не принимать чужие слова близко к сердцу . После всех жизненных обстоятельств, через которые ты прошла, ты добилась самых невероятных высот. Пусть так будет и дальше Гага. Мы в тебя верим. Россия с тобой. Приезжай в город Волгоград. Я и мои друзья будем ждать тебя, покажем все интересные места в городе абсолютно бесплатно. Я знаю Английский и немного испанский, так что мы сможем найти общий язык. Надеюсь мое предложение дойдет до тебя, а мы дойдем вместе до ЗАГСА по адресу Краснознаменская 8. Рядом есть Конфетки - бараночки и жар пицца. Также в нашем распоряжении набережная. К твоему приезду поменяем плитку и асфальт. Леди Гага я тебя люблю приезжай пожалуйста. Заранее спасибо.",

  "🥰❤謝謝你❤感謝你愛心💯💯💯❤尊敬佩服❤鞠躬 財運         捨方能得，不捨不得，捨即佈施。1.財佈施得財富。         2.法佈施。凡是別人想知道、想學習的合于正道的方法，只要自己懂、自己會，就熱心去教，能夠得聰明智慧的果報。         3.無畏佈施。即在眾生身心不安、恐懼害怕時，能夠幫助其消除恐懼，如此會得健康長壽的果報。         曾有一個學員功德很大，自己捐助了許多貧困的孩子，家裡還養了八個孩子，親生的卻只有兩個。離婚後跟她婆婆說：「我什麼都沒給過妳，我給妳買處房子。」就將僅有的幾萬塊錢奉獻給了婆婆，之後她每年仍堅持過年過節及婆婆生日去孝敬婆婆，很令人感動。此外，她每年都要親自去貧困地區捐款，送一些衣物。她當初沒錢，從一個拾破爛的到今天有了自己的生意，並有兩處房子，這都是捨來的。         貪小便宜吃大虧的道理。這個易經太極圖，出去的是一個魚尾巴，回來的卻是一個大腦袋。要是貪小便宜，等到明年吃虧就比今年大。         什麼叫貪小便宜？比如把單位的信封、信紙等東西帶回家，單位分東西時先挑好的，為講價錢跟做小買賣的爭吵等等。古人曾訓誡：「于肩挑小販、苦力，莫討便宜。」         貪心過重的表現，讓人賺不到什麼錢，那他們怎麼活？社會怎麼發展？ 提示：你要求別人的時候，你要先付出，因果才能成立。         你怎麽樣對人，人亦會怎麼樣對你。人與人交往一定要守時，你不守時要求別人守時沒有道理。欠人東西一定要還的，欠人時間也一樣要還的。人家要你幫助時，你常說等一下，你自己去辦事就不要怪別人要你等一下了。         改造命運只能靠自己改。         逢人要說好話，這是別人對你說好話的因。每天對人施捨笑容，施捨好話，可以使身邊的人身心安樂，這也是行善！         有一個老人特別省，我到他家一看，全是破爛堆，他還說：「我勤儉節約」。我說：「你家倒楣事也多。」他說：「是，我也不知道怎麼回事。」「你貪心啊！有捨不得的心，財運就不行。」他問：「那我怎麼變財運？」「你把家裡的破爛捨一捨、賣一賣，支援國家建設。」他問：「靈嗎？」我說：「靈！」他把破爛賣完了，他兒子多年沒找到工作，結果找著了。 舉一個例子：        上了公共汽車，一元錢。剛好，只有一張十元，放了十元進投幣箱，感覺我的十元沒有白花，那你種了9元錢的種子。 提示：捨的時候不太樂意，得的時候也會困難，這是現實中眾多的人為什麼來錢那麼困難的原因。 「好讀書，不求甚解」。這是一句好話，現代人不明白這個也是讀書捷徑。選一些好書給還沒有上小學的小朋友讀，不要解釋，讓他們每天讀，慢慢他們就能夠背下來，背下來後還要每天早晚讀，慢慢心中就會平靜下來，產生定力；心有定力，知識才能轉化為智慧，為自己所用。         科學家曾做了一個試驗，把一支玻璃試管插入水的容器內，然後，收集人們在不同心態下的「氣水」，結果發現了：當一個人心平氣和時呼出的氣體變成水後，澄清透明，無色；悲痛之時水中有少許白色沉澱；生氣時則有紫色的沉澱。當他們把受試者生氣時呼出的「生氣水」，注射到一隻大白鼠身上，幾分鐘後大白鼠就死了。         免疫力可以通過身體鍛煉等多種途徑得以增強，但是，人心理的平靜度才是免疫力的本源。         發怒是「火燒功德林」，將你以前辛苦積累的福德化為灰燼。特別是針對自己的時候，千萬不能起嗔恨心。用別人的錯誤來懲罰自己，損失太大了！ 生氣恨心者命還是不好，悲傷完了並不生氣者，命運會很快好轉，事業開始轉運。 氣恨心重的人命多悲慘，隨和謙讓的人命特好，得天之道。若生氣恨心，以後就會發生一件生氣的事，若天天如此，堆積太多了，災害必降。         有的女孩問我怎麼變漂亮，我說：「天天微笑，三年以後必見成效。」        老人窮，我教他參：     1.「我不應該受不了好」。受不了好就是跟自然力較勁，給錢不要，自然力就不給你了，不給你又生氣又埋怨：「我怎麼這麼窮、這麼苦？」   2.多參自己說的過頭話，「爭取變成好東西，好東西沒錢。」 3.「有那麼多錢有什麼用？我夠吃夠喝就得了。」心口如一，自然力會保佑這樣的人，心口不一。自然力讓你夠吃喝，有事時沒錢。 4.「我不應該看不上別人。」 你看不上別人，別人就看不上你的店。 5.「我不應該跟人較勁」。 你較勁，客戶就跟你較勁。 6.人不能有私心，發財應該先祝願客戶都能得到滿意的結果，能給他們帶來優質的服務和美好的回憶。 書名：周老師講心法 好書：弟子規。         于道光先生說：某夜，有個書生路過東嶽廟，有個人竟然從緊閉的廟門中穿了出來，書生便撲向前去，跪倒在地，嘴巴還直嚷嚷著：神明顯靈啦！那人立刻伸手將他攙扶起來，並對他說道：「這位仁兄誤會了，我並不是你口中所謂的神明，我是右臺司鏡官，出差到此來遞送統計資料的。」 「莫非就是在管理那面辨別世間善惡的業力鏡嗎！」 「你剛才所提的業力鏡，顯現的人表現在外的善行與惡事。」 「諸天神明便決議，將原來業力鏡移到左臺，用來顯現人的作為；再於右臺增設這一面心鏡，讓人可以清楚地看到他們的內心。清澈潔淨如水晶的人，就是千中選一。而我的工作就是當人面對心鏡時，從旁記錄鏡中所顯現的一切，每三個月一次，將所記的資料送到東嶽大帝座前，作為降罪賜福的依據。至於這降罪賜福的標準，則是名氣越大，對其要求自然也就越高、越嚴；掩飾的伎倆越是精細，那麼處罰也就越重。」         書生聽完後，便再三向神官拜謝。 作者 紀曉嵐        德澤蔭後         宛平縣有個陳鶴齡。他弟媳要求分家另居。弟媳說：「大哥你是一個男子漢，能多方經營。我只是一個寡婦女流，子女又小，請你把家產分給我三分之二。」         陳鶴年說：「弟媳說的是，應當依從她。」         弟媳又以孤寡不能出去追索欠債為藉口，要求再把現有財貨分成兩份，而把多年以來債主尚未償還的債券，加上利息，作為鶴齡應得的那一份，鶴齡也委屈地應承下來了。後來那些債券，大部分都沒辦法索取，鶴齡因此陷入極端貧困之中。這是乾隆丙午（1786）年發生的事。         這一年，鶴齡的兒子陳三立，在鄉試考中舉人。我有一位同年名叫李步玉，他和陳鶴齡住處相近，得知三立考中舉人，說：「皇天終究還是沒有虧待好心的人。」 淳樸得福         御史胡牧亭先生講了一個故事：他的家鄉有一位富翁，這人並不善於賺錢謀生，但他的財富總像是用不完，他不懂得調養身體，但他一輩子也沒得過什麼大病，有時碰到災禍，也會意外得到解決。         一次，偶然有人扶乩召仙，鄉人就以這個疑問來請教乩仙。         乩仙判語說：「這位富翁上輩子，他淳樸敦厚，絲毫沒有與人計較之心；他悠悠忽忽，從來沒有患得患失之慮；他雖然落落漠漠，但待人平等，心中無愛無憎；他襟懷坦蕩，總是直心直行，無偏無私。有人欺侮他，他不與之爭競；有人欺騙他，他不心生巧詐；有人以惡言誹謗他，他既不心懷嗔恨，也不嗔怒於人；有人捏造罪狀陷害他，他也不報復。一生平庸，老死於茅舍，並沒有什麼功德，獨有那顆淳樸善良的心，卻為神明所欣賞，所以降福於他，使他今生終身幸福。」         胡先生所講的這個故事，從情理上說，世間倒真有這種情況。 書名   紀曉嵐寫的因果故事 1.為人施捨財物，救急扶危 叫做善，行善的人，將來準富，因為天不虧人。 2.天理是，明中施捨，暗裏天還，為了義舉盡心竭力，任勞任怨，叫做功，有功於世的人，會有權柄，因為捨己為人是出貴的根。 3.人借行善立功，把性情練得爐火純青。遇逆境都能和顏悅色地忍受，死心化性，才叫做德。有德性的人，才能立住萬古。             因為救人的性是一救萬古。人能做到善功德三個字，就是聖賢了。             好佔便宜的人長陰命（造惡業）；好生怨氣的人消宿命（損福報）；好動性（耍脾氣）的人，消天命（損智慧）。         怨人是苦海，越怨心裏越難過，以致於不是生病，就是招禍。 笑不但除病還能轉命 生氣容易上火，哪能不生病呢？若能不怨人，可以解無量的冤。找好處能生啟發力，能接萬人緣，是消因果的根。 書名   王鳳儀善人行道實錄 歡迎翻印 成為「富翁」的三個要項： 1.多存錢： 也就是「做好事」及「存好心」。 2.少花用： 在心念上要「除惡念」。 在行為上能「少享福」。 3.提高利率（或報酬率）： 【心量放大】，念念為廣大眾生！不斷淨化心靈，放下放下再放下！ 祈願每個人在這個宇宙銀行裡，都能成為大富翁！ 書名   最大銀行 作者   丞捷",

  "@beanieboos20121986  I find the lyrics important and the art used in her presentations.  How much do you know about these 2 facets of her internet presence?",
  "@SOBERJOYOUSandFREE  I love the part \"use your passion, no return\"",
  "I do not believe that you can respond to my question comfortably using YouTube,  unless you know something I do not about this limited (perhaps intentionally controlled YouTube system) preventing anything more than comment-response as it is the case that most people wishing to utilize social media platforms wish to do so more fully without disclosing privacy which could lead to dangerous (life-threatening) situations for some.  We are all aware of how insanely some will become toward others as we see internet trolls utilizing the anonymous status as an opportunity to take hotshots on anyone.  Rather than utilize expensive Ai to carefully monitor communications, I see only for posts on Facebook (for example) the use of ignorant Ai bots which do not seem assigned to monitor/protect messages like this which has repelled common persons from Facebook here in our states.  The Ai being utilized seems incapable of discerning between concret language/ concepts being conveyed and contextual presentation utilizing same language with alternate intent that humans get easily.  For example, (simplistic) Michael Jackson\u0027s use of the words I\u0027m bad!  We all understood that this meant, better than good!  The emphasis, being, upon the reversal.  When lyrics are reversed, it means the opposite plus more than, it is not meant in context to be taken literally and straightforwardly!  Another example is Bill Withers song \"Use me,\"  this seems to be something of an unhealthy interpersonal, description from a sick person, but the first line in the song reveals the context, \"MY friends THINK it\u0027s their appointed DUTY..  (because being a friend has nothing related to duty, we are clued in by this conflict between these two concepts that this phrase alone prepares the human to correctly interpret the rest of the song.\"  I would not have known this myself because I am similar to Ai in that I have a form of Autism due to my mother\u0027s practices during pregnancy.   It has taken me this many years to understand my level/form of this affliction.  I am 62, and every day, I hear things in songs I loved long ago that I had little understanding of at the time.  Another good example is the group that sings Murderah, I\u0027m a lyrical gangster..  I forget the actual title and group name.  But, again, unless the words are used  in lyrics, society and Ai assume that it is not art, this must be corrected.  The tragedy and injustice toward artists utilizing social media today are the limited capabilities of Ai and Homeland security working WITH business rather than against up and coming, wishing only to express what is naturally within.  The worst shame of this failure is that the very people most likely to solve many of the problems in society are those of us who have spent the most time with our boots and ears to the ground.  However, as much talk/complaint is made by big business experts about YOU CANNOT FIND GOOD HELP (employees for hire) anymore, the same whimpy complaint the idle wealthy used to spit out and were made fun of years ago by ordinary people from my generation has reached the entrepreneur level and because they were never down this low, they are clueless as to the reality that they sound like CAN\u0027T DO people now themselves!  Meanwhile, the entire county has left the house to live in the outhouse, others shat in generations ago and that outhouse has expanded into not only the home, but the entire neighborhood at this point.  People are figuratively and now literally sitting in retail clothing in thrift stores!  So, this tells me that this toxicity has gone to retail, and is on it\u0027s way into the boardroom, it is literally in some bedrooms in America!",
  "This intentional act of defamation in clothing left in fitting rooms at thrift stores will make it\u0027s way up the system, until everyone has a clue that this is, as I warned the JWs that came to speak to me about the 4 horsemen and the last days, as if I had not known years and years ago.  I threw they out in outrage that they came to warn ME, and so I said, this country is a CESSPOOL.\" WHAT MAKES ANYONE THINK A KING SHOULD BE THE ONE TO CLEAN IT UP!",

  "❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Isaiah 40 New International Version Comfort for God’s People 40 Comfort, comfort my people,     says your God. 2 Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,     and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed,     that her sin has been paid for, that she has received from the Lord’s hand     double for all her sins. 3 A voice of one calling: “In the wilderness prepare     the way for the Lord[a]; make straight in the desert     a highway for our God.[b] 4 Every valley shall be raised up,     every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level,     the rugged places a plain. 5 And the glory of the Lord will be revealed,     and all people will see it together. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.” 6 A voice says, “Cry out.”     And I said, “What shall I cry?” “All people are like grass,     and all their faithfulness is like the flowers of the field. 7 The grass withers and the flowers fall,     because the breath of the Lord blows on them.     Surely the people are grass. 8 The grass withers and the flowers fall,     but the word of our God endures forever.” 9 You who bring good news to Zion,     go up on a high mountain. You who bring good news to Jerusalem,[c]     lift up your voice with a shout, lift it up, do not be afraid;     say to the towns of Judah,     “Here is your God!” 10 See, the Sovereign Lord comes with power,     and he rules with a mighty arm. See, his reward is with him,     and his recompense accompanies him. 11 He tends his flock like a shepherd:     He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart;     he gently leads those that have young. 12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,     or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket,     or weighed the mountains on the scales     and the hills in a balance? 13 Who can fathom the Spirit[d] of the Lord,     or instruct the Lord as his counselor? 14 Whom did the Lord consult to enlighten him,     and who taught him the right way? Who was it that taught him knowledge,     or showed him the path of understanding? 15 Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket;     they are regarded as dust on the scales;     he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust. 16 Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires,     nor its animals enough for burnt offerings. 17 Before him all the nations are as nothing;     they are regarded by him as worthless     and less than nothing. 18 With whom, then, will you compare God?     To what image will you liken him? 19 As for an idol, a metalworker casts it,     and a goldsmith overlays it with gold     and fashions silver chains for it. 20 A person too poor to present such an offering     selects wood that will not rot; they look for a skilled worker     to set up an idol that will not topple. 21 Do you not know?     Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning?     Have you not understood since the earth was founded? 22 He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth,     and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy,     and spreads them out like a tent to live in. 23 He brings princes to naught     and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing. 24 No sooner are they planted,     no sooner are they sown,     no sooner do they take root in the ground, than he blows on them and they wither,     and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff. 25 “To whom will you compare me?     Or who is my equal?” says the Holy One. 26 Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens:     Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one     and calls forth each of them by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength,     not one of them is missing. 27 Why do you complain, Jacob?     Why do you say, Israel, “My way is hidden from the Lord;     my cause is disregarded by my God”? 28 Do you not know?     Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God,     the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary,     and his understanding no one can fathom. 29 He gives strength to the weary     and increases the power of the weak. 30 Even youths grow tired and weary,     and young men stumble and fall; 31 but those who hope in the Lord     will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles;     they will run and not grow weary,     they will walk and not be faint.",
  "❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Psalm 47 King James Version 47 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 2 For the Lord most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth. 3 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet. 4 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah. 5 God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet. 6 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises. 7 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding. 8 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness. 9 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.",
  "❤❤❤❤❤ Psalm 48 King James Version 48 Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness. 2 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. 3 God is known in her palaces for a refuge. 4 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together. 5 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away. 6 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail. 7 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind. 8 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah. 9 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple. 10 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness. 11 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments. 12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof. 13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following. 14 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.",

Surah Al Ahzab ayat 59 يٰٓاَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُلْ لِّاَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنٰتِكَ وَنِسَاۤءِ الْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ يُدْنِيْنَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِنْ جَلَابِيْبِهِنَّۗ ذٰلِكَ اَدْنٰىٓ اَنْ يُّعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَۗ وَكَانَ اللّٰهُ غَفُوْرًا رَّحِيْمًا Artinya: Wahai Nabi (Muhammad), mengatakan kepada istri-istrimu, anak-anak perempuanmu dan istri-istri orang mukmin agar mereka mengulurkan jilbabnya ke seluruh tubuh mereka. Yang demikian itu agar mereka lebih mudah dikenali sehingga mereka tidak diganggu. Allah Maha Pengampun lagi Maha Penyayang. 2. Surah Al A\u0027raf ayat 26 يٰبَنِيْٓ اٰدَمَ قَدْ اَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ لِبَاسًا يُّوَارِيْ سَوْءٰتِكُمْ وَرِيْشًاۗ وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوٰى ذٰلِكَ خَيْرٌۗ ذٰلِكَ مِنْ اٰيٰتِ اللّٰهِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَذَّكَّرُوْنَ Artinya: Wahai anak cucu Adam, sungguh Kami telah menurunkan kepadamu pakaian untuk menutupi auratmu dan bulu (sebagai bahan pakaian untuk menghias diri). (Akan tetapi,) pakaian takwa itulah yang paling baik. Yang demikian itu merupakan sebagian tanda-tanda (kekuasaan) Allah agar mereka selalu ingat. 3. Surah An-Nur ayat 31 وَقُلْ لِّلْمُؤْمِنٰتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ اَبْصَارِهِنَّ وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوْجَهُنَّ وَلَا يُبْدِيْنَ زِيْنَتَهُنَّ اِلَّا مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلٰى جُيُوْبِهِنَّۖ وَلَا يُبْدِيْنَ زِيْنَتَهُنَّ اِلَّا لِبُعُوْلَتِهِنَّ اَوْ اٰبَاۤىِٕهِنَّ اَوْ اٰبَاۤءِ بُعُوْلَتِهِنَّ اَوْ اَبْنَاۤىِٕهِنَّ اَوْ اَبْنَاۤءِ بُعُوْلَتِهِنَّ اَوْ اِخْوَانِهِنَّ اَوْ بَنِيْٓ اِخْوَانِهِنَّ اَوْ بَنِيْٓ اَخَوٰتِهِنَّ اَوْ نِسَاۤىِٕهِنَّ اَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ اَيْمَانُهُنَّ اَوِ التّٰبِعِيْنَ غَيْرِ اُولِى الْاِرْبَةِ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ اَوِ الطِّفْلِ الَّذِيْنَ لَمْ يَظْهَرُوْا عَلٰى عَوْرٰتِ النِّسَاۤءِ ۖوَلَا يَضْرِبْنَ بِاَرْجُلِهِنَّ لِيُعْلَمَ مَا يُخْفِيْنَ مِنْ زِيْنَتِهِنَّۗ وَتُوْبُوْٓا اِلَى اللّٰهِ جَمِيْعًا اَيُّهَ الْمُؤْمِنُوْنَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُوْنَ Artinya: Mengatakan kepada para perempuan yang beriman hendaklah mereka menjaga, memelihara kemaluannya, dan janganlah menampakkan perhiasannya (bagian tubuhnya), kecuali yang (biasa) terlihat. Hendaklah mereka menutupkan kain kerudung ke dadanya. Hendaklah pula mereka tidak menampakkan perhiasannya (auratnya), kecuali kepada suami mereka, ayah mereka, ayah suami mereka, putra-putra mereka, putra-putra suami mereka, saudara-saudara laki-laki mereka, putra-putra saudara laki-laki mereka, putra-putra saudara perempuan mereka, para perempuan (sesama muslim), hamba sahaya yang mereka miliki, para pelayan laki-laki (tua) yang tidak mempunyai keinginan (terhadap perempuan), atau anak-anak yang belum mengerti tentang aurat perempuan. Hendaklah diketahui pula mereka tidak mengentakkan kaki agar perhiasan yang mereka sembunyikan. Bertobatlah kamu semua kepada Allah, wahai orang-orang yang beriman, agar kamu beruntung.",

Should I be a pacifist? Or should I use my fists? I’m feeling evil, think I’ll kill them all I’m homicidal, and I’ve got a taste I want to wipe out the Monster race I’ve got no patience, got no resolve I will slaughter, screw the dialogue I fell from the light Talk? Or should I fight?

  "Intro: Whoooooaaaa - oh - oh - oh - oh - oh - oh - oh -oh - oh Story of Undertale. I fell from the light. Talk or should I fight? Monster genocide. This my Undertale. Verse 1: I fell through a cave on Mount Ebott, I faced an evil, talking’ flower in a pot, Explains the plot, Wants me dead, wants me to rot. Toriel saves me, takes me to her home, And hooks me up with a brand new monster phone, Leaves me alone, But I escape and meet some bones. Should I be a pacifist? Or should I use my fists? I’m feeling evil, think I’ll kill them all. Chorus: I’m homicidal, and I’ve got a taste, I want to wipe out the Monster race. I’ve got no patience, got no resolve, I will slaughter, screw the dialogue. I fell from the light. Talk or Should I fight? Monster genocide. This my Undertale. Verse 2: I’ll slaughter Undyne, I’ll waste who I choose. With all this EXP there’s no way that I’ll lose. Now watch me move, I won’t stop I’m feelin\u0027 rude. Asgore is shaking, he hears my approach, I’ll slaughter Sans and squash his bro like a roach, Chara’s my coach, All these monsters I will poach. Screw being pacifist. I think I’ll use my fists. I’m feeling evil, think I’ll kill them all. Chorus: I’m homicidal, and I’ve got a taste, I want to wipe out the Monster race. I’ve got no patience, got no resolve, I will slaughter, screw the dialogue. Bridge : Burnt pan, toy knife, use a stick to take your life. Tough glove, ballet shoes, epic fight like front page news. King Asgore wants to collect human souls, Seven of them, is his ultimate goal.  Open the door, to humanity’s realm, Start a new war, humans overwhelm.  Chorus: I’m homicidal, and I’ve got a taste, I want to wipe out the Monster race. I’ve got no patience, got no resolve, I will slaughter, screw the dialogue.",

Or should I use my fists? I’m feeling evil, think I’ll kill them all [Chorus] I’m homicidal, and I’ve got a taste I want to wipe out the Monster race I’ve got no patience, got no resolve I will slaughter, screw the dialogue See upcoming pop shows Get tickets for your favorite artists You might also like ‎loml Taylor Swift But Daddy I Love Him Taylor Swift THE HEART PART 6 Drake [Bridge] I fell from the light Talk?

Verse 1: I fell through a cave on Mount Ebott, I faced an evil, talking’ flower in a pot, Explains the plot, Wants me dead, wants me to rot. Toriel saves me, takes me to her home, And hooks me up with a brand new monster phone, Leaves me alone, But I escape and meet some bones. Should I be a pacifist? Or should I use my fists? I’m feeling evil, think I’ll kill them all. Chorus: I’m homicidal, and I’ve got a taste, I want to wipe out the Monster race. I’ve got no patience, got no resolve, I will slaughter, screw the dialogue. I fell from the light. Talk or Should I fight? Monster genocide. This my Undertale. Verse 2: I’ll slaughter Undyne, I’ll waste who I choose. With all this EXP there’s no way that I’ll lose. Now watch me move, I won’t stop I’m feelin\u0027 rude. Asgore is shaking, he hears my approach, I’ll slaughter Sans and squash his bro like a roach, Chara’s my coach, All these monsters I will poach. Screw being pacifist. I think I’ll use my fists. I’m feeling evil, think I’ll kill them all. Chorus: I’m homicidal, and I’ve got a taste, I want to wipe out the Monster race. I’ve got no patience, got no resolve, I will slaughter, screw the dialogue. Bridge : Burnt pan, toy knife, use a stick to take your life. Tough glove, ballet shoes, epic fight like front page news. King Asgore wants to collect human souls, Seven of them, is his ultimate goal.  Open the door, to humanity’s realm, Start a new war, humans overwhelm.  Chorus: I’m homicidal, and I’ve got a taste, I want to wipe out the Monster race. I’ve got no patience, got no resolve, I will slaughter, screw the dialogue.",

Please know that we were just as confused as you are now. ~~~ *Life is incredibly short. Be mindful of death. It is your friend. We do not know your time of death. Young people passed away before old people every day. Countless beings all over the world are born and die in every moment. We live in the realm of birth and death. Nothing last. We take nothing with us at the end of your life. Everything stays behind. Except our mind. Give everything you have now. Don’t wait. Pursue your dreams. Life is a dream. The same mind that perceives the dream perceives all the world. The world is yours, but only now in this very moment. Live.* ❤❤❤",

  "bad romances wouldn\u0027t happen if females Did not pick their own husbands and their fathers choose their husbands for them . for thousands of years of human history daughters lived with their fathers and Only leave to live with their husband after dad finds a suitable good man for her . there is a Very very good Biological Reason why women should be virgins until marriage . females are MONOGAMOUS by their own Nature and Biologically , human biological females are supposed sleep with only 1 Man their entire lives according to their own Biology as Mother Nature Designed women . Mother Nature is the QUEEN OF ALL QUEENS  these are Her RULES for women  disobeying her Laws has consequences in the form of Alpha Widow Syndrome which happens to all women who choose POORLY on the man they give their virginity to . Bad boys study women so they know how to Manipulate female silly emotions to get between their legs . Fathers traditionally kept their Daughters away from these men for Thousands upon Thousands of Years of Human History . Now it is the the majority of women who are Breaking their homes and kicking dads out of the house so their daughter\u0027s lives are ruined because dad is supposed choose her husbands . Authentic Alpha Males are good at Vetting other men .  the vast majority of women think with their feelings which is the WRONG WAY to choose a man every single time . your Fathers are supposed to choose them for you . women are WRONG for not liking the good men that fathers choose for them as well . Men are Not supposed to be physically pretty at ALL . Men\u0027s nature is to be the Work Horse so to speak  . It is the Woman\u0027s Job in Nature  be Physically pretty and attractive . men\u0027s only real requirement is to be strong enough to Work Hard , only the top 20% of all men possesses physical feminine beauty characteristics that women find physically attractive in men .  men are not physically attractive by nature we are not supposed to be women are so HORRIBLE at choosing men .  you choose the pretty boys which have a million options on what woman they want to have sex with  . bad romances will stop when women learn to Respect the men in their families and treat them as if their advice matters . sexual attention is NEVER to be confused with Relationship attention  they are NOT THE SAME AT ALL . Masculine Alpha Men are Do Not Become emotionally attached to women from sexual pleasure at all . it\u0027s purely physical , men produce millions of sperm a day , Men and women are Not the same at ALL  . By Nature men were designed to Reproduce with as many women as Possible  , we produce Billions of Sperm a Year every single day we have the urges to reproduce by Nature\u0027s Design .",

If you think, you made something wrong by last years is not your fail, and God never abandon you, however, despite what priests say, God don\u0027t rule this World, God made it, but don\u0027t rule it, because God gave World to people, and people gave World to Satan, long time ago, unconsciously.

  "\"Gangnam Style\" was the first YouTube video to reach a billion hits. That\u0027s sort of unfair to the American slant of the video-sharing website because of the vast, basically untapped, population of countries neighboring South Korea. Few other videos from that part of the world enjoy massive amounts of hits. The video, because of its hooked beats and its charming and refreshingly unique, even dorky, dancing by its singer, the K-Pop rapper Psy, went crazy-viral. If you adjust world population densities with consistent sources of world music, nothing could compare to Lady Gaga\u0027s \"Bad Romance\" video. It blew everything else out of the water. Its influence on world culture went viral. It has been covered by countless singers. It has been converted into marching band music and at least one Bach-style fugue. And it\u0027s a tune that has been adopted onstage by another charming entity: a great big group of Chinese senior citizens. \"Bad Romance\" is in a league of its own. It\u0027s witty and freaky at the same time. It\u0027s high fashion. It\u0027s \"desperate.\" It\u0027s filled with tons of product placement. Its stripper- and \"Thriller\"-based choreography is unequalled. The entire video is shot on an all-white bathhouse set with a drop ceiling (saved a lot of money). It\u0027s a lovely tribute to the late Alexander McQueen. And it\u0027s a sublime adjunct to an amazing song by an amazing songstress, who, after all these years, shows no signs of abatement.",

I remember running away from our house and getting on my bicycle to go to my nana\u0027s house and cool off a bit. I was 13 at the time, and my escape was LG and her music. My nana gave me 15 Philippine Pesos (around 30 US cents) to go to a computer shop and play games with my cousins. that was the day that I got to listen to this song. let\u0027s just say that after bopping to this song, I kind of gained guts and courage to not give a fcck about the beatings and shit my dad gave me for being different. I am now 28, a proud transwoman living life to the fullest, and I know that the song is a major bop, but I can\u0027t help but cry listening to this today.",

I legitimately have no clue on how she got out of this because If I\u0027m not mistaken, that is sheet metal that she is wrapped in and the rings seem to be built onto it by those bars. You can see in the first few frames before spinning that it does wrap behind her back a little bit but not completely. It is wrapped around the curvature of her body so you can\u0027t just pull it up either. The only thing I can think of is those little knobs are some kind of mechanism that holds it together and if you remove those it falls apart. Maybe there\u0027s something I don\u0027t see here and I\u0027m just an idiot which is most likely the case, but that doesn\u0027t make me any less confused lmao",

It is great now, but it was great too. Back in the day it was just another good song. It was treated as any other ok commercial pop song. I liked it a lot, as well as the whole second album by Maroon 5. What I am trying to say is that there is probably many great songs being made right now which girls and boys will call unmatched, \"they don\u0027t make it like they did it back in the day\" kind of songs. Keep your mind and your ears open. There is plenty in the past, a lot now, and much more ahead of us. Cheers.",

  "O personagem a verdade que vive, e amou e perdoou: *\"Pai santo, e o Filho da justiça de respeito à vida, e o espírito santo puro viver, perdoe a ignorância humana de alguns homens que falaram que o Senhor Jesus Cristo está órfão, e falou que foi o pai que mandou matar a vida de Jesus. O perdão que pedimos foi a ex-comunhão do culpado pecador qua quisesse fazer falso Cristo, e quis prejudicar o verdadeiro Jesus Cristo.\"* - O homem falou: *\"Agora sei que cada um fala o que quer falar em uma região geográfica. Perdoe a ignorância e ex-comungado seja o culpado. E o Senhor Deus vivo santo seja inocente imutável semelhante do inocente que Ele sempre foi, é, e será. Pois, o Senhor não ofenderia a própria vida do Senhor, e foi feito este e outro julgamento. E no julgar os pedidos de perdão para conceder o perdão àqueles que o Senhor Deus vivo santo da Liberdade autorizou a serem perdoados. Aos justificados, e aos generosos de doação e os que ajudam as viúvas, a viver, e órfãos, e aflitos, e angústiados, e necessitados, e oprimidos, e sofridos, e os que foram perseguidos por confessar o Jesus Cristo e a Igreja, e confessar que o Senhor Deus vivo santo fez o Verbo da vida e o outro Verbo do surgimento do mundo inorgânico e orgânico o criado, que cada um receba ajuda para viver, na medida da vontade santa de ajudar á viver.\"* - O Filho da verdade: *\"Necessário é fazer um exército de homens sinceros carnais e um exército sincero de mulheres carnais de costumes de orações e louvores, e caridade de manter o pão da safra agrícola, e as águas potável límpida, e as vestuários do corpo, e as moderadas de refúgio e descanso vivo, e a educação profetica que liberta e concede o livramento. Para ajudar as pessoas adultas e as crianças a viverem. Há esperança de muitos homens e muitas mulheres sejam santos salvos, sem serem contaminados com o falso testemunho de que falaram que o Senhor Deus vivo santo mandou matar o Senhor Jesus Cristo, ou mandou matar órfão, ou programou mandar ferir as viúvas, ou punir pessoas que sofriam as perseguições por confessarem o Senhor Jesus Cristo que mandou avisar do perigo. Prejudicar a vida de pessoas que vivem em paz, e não mereçem o insulto e não mereçem o sofrer, tem sido um perigo de ameaças. Pois, não justificarei o impio malfeitor que não respeitou o Senhor Deus vivo santo, e Senhor da vida. Melhor é o ensinar a viverem longe de malfeitores que não usam de misericórdia, e justiça, e compaixão, e de amor respeitoso com aqueles que O Deus mandou perdoar.\"* - O Filho da justiça: *\"Se o Senhor Deus vivo santo perdoou ou mandou perdoar os que mereçem o perdão, então, obediência é o melhor remédio.\"* - O homem santo: *\"Aceita o que o Deus de amor mandou respeitar que dói menos a frustração. Respeitar o Senhor Deus vivo santo da recompensa é um amor de viver para aquele que respeita o viver. Não dár a sentença de morte é um excelente negócio.\"* - O Filho do santo: *\"Foi julgado por alguns que houve falso testemunho em falar que o Senhor Deus vivo santo mandou matar, ou roubar, ou destruir, pois, uma Verdade e um verbo fiel e leal e verdadeiro falou [O Senhor Deus vivo santo não foi praticante da injustiça e não mandou matar aquele que ensinou a viver e a respeitar o Deus eterno santo], o espírito santificado falou que foi considerado inocente aquele que falou \u0027[Vive Ó Senhor Deus vivo santo verdadeiro todo-poderoso, vive para sempre com a tua dignidade de viver, Ó santo Senhor].\"* - Amém e graças ao Senhor Deus vivo santo Leal Já Jáh, e o louvor aos mestres mensageiros detetives santos heróis investigativos, e o louvor ao espírito de profécia do aviso santo de não levantarás falso testemunho, e o louvor ao Santo nome do Senhor Jesus Cristo maravilhas.",

  "Very good  best song🎵 ❤❤❤❤🎉 Today\u0027s world has become one where politicians and judges make politics and rulings to survive.  Even though science has developed in the world for thousands of years, politics has not changed at all due to vested interests. The first jobs in the world to disappear due to AI are politicians and judges. To become the best country, politics and trials will be controlled by AI❤❤ Looking back on history, human politics deceived the people and eventually started a war.  This is past history.  In the future, it is time to get rid of human politicians and have the best selected scientists create AI to create the right policies through AI for the national interest and the people and to develop the country through good policies. History repeats itself, and human politics also repeats itself. ❤The best AI We need a revolution in the political system where scientists are selected and AI scientists create and govern fair politics. An equal and just country where AI, which is upgraded by AI scientists selected as the best gifted people, is governed by fair and just politics. Should I live in?  Or will human trash live in a country of inequality for 1,000,000 years, being gaslighted? 오늘날 정치인들과 법관들은  자기들 살려는 정치와 판결을 내리는 세계가 되었다. 세계는 수천년 과학이 발전했음에도 기득권 때문에 정치는 전혀 변하지 않했다.세상에서 AI로 가장 먼저 사라져야 할 직업이 정치인들과 법관들이다.최고의 나라가 되려면  정치와 재판은 AI로❤❤역사를 돌이켜 보면 인간 정치는 국민을 속이고 결국에는 전쟁을 일으켰습니다. 이것이 지난 역사입니다. 앞으로는  인간 정치인들 없애고  최고의 선발된 과학자들이 AI를 만들어 국익과 국민을 위한 AI를 통해 바른 정책을 만들고 좋은 정책을 통해  국가 발전을  할때입니다.역사는 반복되고,인간 정치도 반복됩니다.❤최고의 AI과학자들을 선발해서 AI과학자들이 공정한  정치 AI를 만들어 정치하는  정치제도의 혁명이  필요합니다.최고의 영재들로 뽑힌 AI과학자들이 업그러이드 시키는 Al가 공정하고 정의로운 정치로 다스려지는 평등하고 정의로운 나라에 살것인가? 아니면 인간 쓰레기들이 천년만년 불평등의 나라에 가스라이팅 당하며 살것인가?",

Δίνει έμπνευση για να γράψω και εγώ κάτι που θα χαθεί στο μπούγιο 😂         Αν νομίσεις ό,τι εισαι κάποιο είδος Βασιλιά σε αυτόν τον κόσμο,  τότε μπορεί να έχεις ένα κάποιο δίκιο όμως είναι με ημερομηνία λήξης!!! Μετά σαν τον ξανθούλη βαριεστημένο ποτηροπιάστη στο βίντεο,  στο τέλος καίγεται!! Γεννιόμαστε όλοι με δανεικό αέρα και από την αρχή της γέννησης μετράμε ανάποδα 1, 2, 3, 10, 20 , 30, 60, 70 χρόνια το προσδόκιμο ζωής εκτός απροόπτου ή ότι άλλο!  Αν νομίζεις πως μπορείς να τσαλακωσεις τους ανθρώπους και να φύγεις σφυρίζοντας, να πεις φέρετε στο πάρτι μου αυτήν η αυτόν και να κάνεις ό,τι σου καπνίσει.  Ο τροχός της ζωής θα τα αναποδογυρίσει όλα και τίποτα δεν θα είναι το ίδιο με πριν. Τίποτα δεν παραγράφεται!! Όταν το προσδόκιμο του βασιλίσκου συμπληρωθεί, υπάρχει η άλλη πλευρά για το βρεις μπροστά σου!! Τα χρόνια περνάνε πίσω δεν ξαναγυρνάνε, το κάρμα θα σε κάνει να πάρεις την άλλη θέση, στα παιδιά σου!! Άμα δεν σου αρέσουν αυτά που γράφω, μην τα διαβάζεις τότε κανέναν δεν σε προσκάλεσε........ Όταν έχω διάθεση μου αρέσει να σερφάρω με το όνομα μου, ανώνυμα!! Και άμα είσαι σαν το αγόρι της ταινίας μην τολμήσεις και εμφανιστείς δεν είσαι ευπρόσδεκτος, ούτε το παρεάκι. Όλοι στο τέλος ξημερώνουμε με την συνείδηση μας!!

I was standing at the edge of the roof when I heard this song.... \"rah rah ro ma ma\", these are the words that helped me to find my place in this world, meaning of life. Now I graduated  university, got my doctorate, married with 3 children, started my own bussiness and live in a manor. But owe this all to Gaga, if i hasn\u0027t met her in my hour of weakness and heard such wise words i\u0027m not sure if i would still be alive. Thank you❤ xoxo",
