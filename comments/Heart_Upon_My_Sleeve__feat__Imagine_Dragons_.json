I\u0027ve bought crystals simply because they came from this beautiful place where u visited - they then travelled to Glastonbury, where I found them. You in the kayak in that emerald ocean, u with your guitar on the pontoon. Its lovely to remember how happy u were. Yet, as others have commented - years on, u r so sorely missed. X.",
