{The genius of this track is the pleasant and beautiful melodic African-like intro. Then it turns into a psychotic and sinister low vibrational drone, pulsating it's way into your system with haunting siren-like strings piercing it's way into your psyche.  Absent of all pure musical connotations. Just Digital Chaos with a direct data message... Welcome to the Matrix...This is America.}

{pondering upon the caricature that glover takes on for this music video, i’ve been pondering this subtext:  perhaps he is also a representation of minorities in america that get caught up in the pipeline of right-wing extremism under the guise that they’re  “ not one of the *bad* ones “  -  displayed by him consistently distracting the schoolkids from the systemic violence all around them.  yet, it’s all for naught by the end of the music video, because none of us get to choose when the people in power suddenly reject you  &  go mask-off with their oppression not *actually* excluding anyone  -  you’ve been merely made to be an accessory for their agenda.}

{I’m just curious if people in low income, black communities ever consider assimilating to the world outside of where they’re from. Behaving, speaking and interacting with others with decency and respect. Drop the attitude… Do you think that might change the way the world sees you or do you want to dig your heels in to what has become “acceptable African-American culture”? Just curious what ppl have to say on the matter???}
{This is so much deeper than most understand. Get your money black man (reparations). Remember with all of Egypt and Pharo’s heart they did not want to give the Israelites anything but through the circumstances created by God they threw their wealth on the Israelites. The same will happen again and we are in that time period. Something is about to happen within these next 10 years that you wouldn’t believe if someone told you. Judgement is at the door step and being nice to black people now wont be close to enough to stop it.}

{This song always reminds me of when I was in APUSH after Trump first got elected (we were talking about his policies and how it'll affect the country and how it relates to previous administrations), and I was crying because I was extremely upset about what he might do. I mentioned that I was worried that he might try and force me out of my home and put me in a camp simply because I'm Native American (my specific tribe is very small and experiences lots of racism, even amongst other tribes). I wonder how my teacher and classmates feel when they also think of me crying that day and worrying about something they told me would never happen. For those who don't know, Native Americans are being targeted by the Trump administration. They are trying to pass a law that would overturn a 1924 law that made Native Americans legal citizens of the US. Since his inauguration ICE agents have been harassing Natives leaving reservations by asking for papers and trying to detain and arrest them.  With his aggressive anti-immigration laws and policies (sending (read: selling) those who can't be sent back to their home country to camps in other countries to be used as a labor force or sent to Guantanamo Bay (yes, the same one they use to torture suspected and convicted terrorists. The camp there is labeled as 'temporary', which given its bloodied history can easily like it to be a death camp in the making). Seeing as Native Americans are from North America and the administration's goal is to send (read: sell to El Salvador) out all illegal people in the country, where would we be sent? All five million plus Native Americans? What would happen to our land, the land that oil, logging, construction, and mining companies have been itching to get their hands on?  For anyone whose read this far and still doesn't believe me, there has already been multiple cases of legal citizens, and even veterans, being illegally detained by ICE, and in one notable case (Davino Watson), was essentially held hostage by ICE for three years and can't sue due to a legal loophole that ICE knowingly used against him. They don't care if you're actually a legal citizen or not, they care about if you look like one. All of this is for me to say to those who never thought that the Trump administration would do something so rancid, blatantly illegal, and fundamentally against human rights; are you ashamed for not seeing the writing on the wall as I, a then 16 year old, did?}

No white people found. And so now, black fatigue is real. So yeah he kinda did and didn't predict the future at the same time and yes its been a loop and yes y'all are some ignorant retarded folk who will never learn....}

{Nova Albion 1577 Never has slaves … Drakes Fleets that are the us military , battled Spain and Indians Might have made some pyramids… Toppled an empire  Gold rush and I start civil war when the east get there with slavery   For almost 300 yrs before they even get close to California…  1820 I annex everything south of California from Spain  Confederate folly tried to take Mexico as slave land as it had been before when Spain controlled prior, when nova northern California forces were almost done explaining America to Mexico City  They the  had to move to stop the confederacy  The Rail way  Then Panama  Watergate … literally  James town 1605 was supposed to be so easy, land by the Yucatán  After the sinking of the invincible Spanish armada at the passage  Spain deceived the colonists so Spain could look for another way around to nova Albion from the Caribbean of the West Indies after I had captured the entirety of the new world from Greenland to Antarctica all the way around. Spain claimed my death when I took the Northern route to return the hinde and left with another fleet by way of the Northern route to nova Albion.nit being seen by Spain below the equator. She forever says I’m a pirate to Spain.  1605 gunpowder treason and plot  With the colonist deceived by the French and the Spanish in the Caribbean, they were never able to reach Bay of Drake on the other side of Panama or me at nova Albion where they had representation and so believed they were not represented in the new world as they were certain they were in the right place… (that part in The declaration where they are upset about the meeting place that they cannot reach) after listening to the French obscuring Drake with France is great and incorrect navigation from Spaniards .. (how they say Columbus of Spain for getting lost in what Spain believed was India from the other way)… It would have been so easy Had James town done their job,  And landed near the second peninsula the Yucatán… and got to bay of Drake, the French would gave been denied Louisiana and the outlawing of slavery by nova Albion would have extended the entire expanse of Drake’s land… the slave trade by the Spanish and Portuguese traders at Brazil of Africans to the Caribbean would have been completely denied in the new world… instead with the French at Louisiana encouraging the worse of the colonist in the south east and Spain maintained a constant shipments of slaves among regular merchant ships to the Caribbean . Drake as the only royal privateer in History embarked on a campaign of piracy freeing slaves and undermining Spains empire on his land. While also batting Spain by land at nova Albion  and all around and denying passage to the French and Spanish at the north and the south to the far side of the new world by sea. The entire age of piracy…  1800 the French revolution begins, a boat… 1803 The French are expelled from the west and on the back end of their losing war to California they sell land they didn’t own to the deceived east  Who knew nothing of California or Mexico other then the narrative Philipiii had approved… Slavery is now officially outlawed in Spains empire by Drake as always intended  1815 Spain and Portugal’s African slave trade is abolished by the crown…  1820  Everything annexed from Spain no slaves all the way to Antarctica…  1821  Spain CEDES Florida to the east, as it’s south of nova California … Spain maintains their narrative of Mexico to the east… without me without nova Albion, with out the fleets  Mexico American war… I’ve already defeated Spain… Baja Waving the burning flag of Spains empire… and they get there after relegitimizing the entire remnants of Spain fighting across under the impression of Spains narrative,  and go we know we beat Mexico we made it to California……………….. Gold rush, … Literally no slaves on that side… Mike G is a piece of sht, and all that bs is wrong…Spains empire never would have fallen and that would still be happening like that… because then There really was no one else and it would have been Louisiana Mexico all the way up … to Alaska completely unchecked Nixion tripping the satellite image and being a dumb ass in his 70’s hotel room thinking he owns the trade routes….and can exploit the advantage space age media… Yeah Waldo shot that sht down from within the military  Nixion did what trumps doing with gallo but not nearly as pathetic as his identity crisis thing… or the wanting to be nobility thing … Donny ducky doesn’t know who his 1800 Daddy is …. And he’s got little Mikey complex …  what’s gonna happen when everyone remembers there was no slavery for nearly 300yr in America and it’s been hidden from history so Spain can hide it fleets of Portuguese and Spanish slavers and look for another way around …  And because the Donny’s want the kingship and nobility for a monopoly …  As literal they would only want the Canal I could approve so they could use it , but not the land because I own it…  And they not care about mine up in Canada …because I own it and they can’t… and that’s kinda why we’re it’s still just starting… they aren’t even to the beginning at bay of Drake yet or even around the world …  We straight up regressed to flat earth for a while… and they went dark ages with the hollow crap… We could literally do the  Johnny Rico… Buenos Aires bit…like now instead of deportations… And then What’s brazils full slaver history ….  That’s all Portugal there …and the entire network.. Brazil to Africa to the Caribbean,then the French say they’re English… Luisiana}

{I take the video contrast between the happy joyful singing and music AND the dark broody mood of Gambino as a metaphor for all aspects of America, not just life for Blacks. Everybody these days, and even back then, was feeling the stress of life.  People at the top grabbing more more more! All while the working class gets breadcrumbs at best. Even the Middle Class has to fight to stay above water, and even starting to slip a little. From what I understand, even Upper middle class professionals are struggling to not drop down.}

{I feel like, there’s the typical mainstream interpretation of this song/video, but, the explanation I cannot unsee/unhear, is the one of black-xploitation. “Get yo money, black man” is akin to, “Whatever makes you money,” which, in this country, black trauma porn or becoming a minstrel show is how you get the bag. Sad. “Don’t catch you slippin up,”…….don’t act “white”…..as if yt people are the gatekeepers of goodness. Last I checked, that was God. Of course, this can be interpreted in many ways, but, I bet few here have considered this explanation. I forgot where I heard it. I’ll link it if I find it.}

A respected colleague of mine showed me this video and it blew me away. The shock value that hit very hard.  America - NWBGA - Never Will Be Great Again. ( not under the current 2025 administration. )}
{Seeing Gambino acting all zesty with a upper half dad bod and dress pants with a mix of “homeless man” Is probably one of the best things i’ve seen in a music video}
{I wonder if there‘s any parallels in camera or creative or directors between this and Kendrick’s halftime show. Like if the same people were involved because the perspectives, the multiple layers of foreground and background in a single shot and the well thought out choreography kinda give off very similar vibes to me.}

{Get it to 1 billion views}
{The fact that this came out before 2020…}
{This song is aging like a pile of crap in water! 😆  Let's support a murderer and give them half a million or more after they stab someone.  Given the statistic that the African Americans have killed more African Americans in the past year than the KKK killed since it's creation, I donno! Seems a bit curious!  How about Johnny Somali in Asia? A promoter of peace and order, that one! 😆  And to think, around when this song came out I definitely had more empathy and sympathy. Now, after the past 9 years of experience here, I've realized just how much Oscar the Grouch is superior to these garbage individuals who cherry pick stories and cases to support... what exactly? Black Lives Matter? That was horse sh*t. If you see the world in that way, you'd better change or off yourself, as you're disconnected from sense. Good lives matter. Good people matter. Those aligned with good matter. Not black. Not white. Not Asian. Not Latino. No superficial trait.  The weak of mind and uneducated attempt to sway the weak of mind and uneducated regarding sense. Brilliant! Good thing we're good at making lemons into lemonade. That is, if your social credit score calculated over the last 9 years alone shows you to be a garbage person, it will double red flag you. If you've a double red flag, your children will have a red flag until at minimum 25, and then, should they be decent, they will be accepted, but will not be allowed to live, go to school, or work various jobs and for various companies regardless of their seeming intelligence. Since this is not based on race or another silly notion, but instead merit, watch as flies fall.}

People without degrees can still have jobs. Children here are not being forced for free labor. People can loan college education even if they are poor, meanwhile other countries require cash to attend. Americans born here have no idea how privileged they are. Go to other third world countries, it is that bad lol}

{At the start of high-school I had to commute about an hour to get there and back via subway. But one day while I'm waiting for the train I see these two guys fighting about a phone or smth, then an old man comes and breaks it up. Then like 5 minutes later they start fighting again and the one bigger guy is over top of the other beating his face in, a crowd had formed around them and I was at the front. Then out of  nowhere a third hooded guy shows up and shoots the big guy right in his back. We all started running and I remember never being so afraid for my life. Then when I'm out of the subway I see an older white guy panting next to me and he looks at me and says, "what the f*ck is wrong with people?" And I just shrugged and said, "this is america".     Two months later I'm still commuting and I find this song 🙃}

{So, you're cool and all, but pornifying violence like this is unforgivable. Art is not above ethics, and in any case it is artistically ignorant to not see this; any such works suffer from this blind spot. Mediocrity is the prize you pay for cheap violence. To re-enact the crime that you purport to oppose doesn't communicate what I wish you were trying to communicate here. It makes for a cynical/sociopathic reading.}

This IS America. “Love or leave it” I love how everyone just dogs      America out, especially the people that live there, but it’s the only place in the world you have the freedom and ability to truly be anything you want. The only thing stopping you is you. Look at Lisa Su, Mike Tyson, Donald Trump, Sundar Pichai, Barak Obama, Neil Armstrong.  These people worked super hard their entire lives to get what they earned and because they did it in America the stars they were reaching for were attainable.}

Gives the Gun the the youth of that culture then lets the youth join in on Americas fun (after doing Americas dirty work the youth is accepted in their system ) While America shows his ass this Youth is behind them. Them Peace Comes ( the choir ) until America (Gambino) erases them before the peace spreads to the youth. No Peace = RIOT.  Supported by Youth…..without the youth America dies. GET YOUR MONEY BLACKMAN THEYVE USED US AND OUR KIDS TO BENEFIT AMERICA FOR YEARS!}

{America isn't just the United States, it's an entire continent. In my opinion, saying that America is just one country is incorrect because America (continent) is made up of several incredible and unique countries, it's not just one. You who call yourselves "Americans" are not alone on this land. Every country born on this continent is part of America, some from the South, others from the Center, and the rest from the North. Despite our differences, we share this land, it belongs to all of us who live on it. So, why should just one country be considered America then?}

Haha Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet Comes with a price tag, baby, face it You should leave if you can't accept the basics Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless I'm just young, rich, and tasteless P Never was much of a romantic I could never take the intimacy And I know it did damage 'Cause the look in your eyes is killin' me I guess then you at an advantage 'Cause you could blame me for everything And I don't know how I'ma manage If one day you just up and leave And I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most So I think it's time (so I think it's time) For us to have a toast Let's have a toast for the douche bags Let's have a toast for the assholes Let's have a toast for the scumbags Every one of them that I know Let's have a toast for the jerk offs That'll never take work off Baby, I got a plan Run away fast as you can}

{This song has a TON of hidden details. The first one is when they handle the gun with care, but they drag the body away.}
{6 years later and this song still is a bop}
{I remember being home on a Sunday night, unpacking from my weekend at a flyball tournament—my dinky, little, unknown first-world dog sport. I had just gotten back from Lodi, CA, to my place in Oakland, CA. I was unpacking, drinking, and chilling when this popped up as a recommended video. I guess I missed the debut the night before... I had to watch it five or six times—maybe more—and still felt like I was missing so much artistry and nuance. I think this video single-handedly reignited my appreciation for art.}

{I know it makes no sense really but I wish they had done this song as a guest spot at the Super Bowl right before Not Like Us. Thematically with what they were doing it could have worked but no complaints it was one of the top 5 SB performances imo.}

{Look how im geekin out.}
{this is not amarica}
{Hay q ser mucho estúpido para saber q no solo USA es america}
{take a second to actually look at the video and think: the massive quantity of cars talks about how there are too many cars in america. the random servants grabbing the gun after gambino kills people shows the desperation for jobs, the random people running and some riots in there show violence and pressure. this is scratching the surface. edit: i’ll add some more (i come back to this song atleast once a day) the cast is all-black, showing the importance of black people in hip-hop. but, at 2:19 or something, he does that thing eminem (white person in hip-hop culture) does and grabs his balls. this contrast is quite peculiar, and i’ve been able to derive meaning not.}

{Had to come back here cz i just saw video of Childish Gambino saying this was originally meant to be a diss to Drake and then they realized it could be more than a diss. Imagine telling someone that a song so good it aint even worth your time man}
{CoryKenshin on crack}
{This hits different in 2025}
{Drake just.. Just nigga. We don't know just go}
{j'aime tellement cette zik et ce clip putain !}
{Gonna hit 1b views really soon!}
{Me}
{blud knew this shi was too hard to be a drake diss}
{1:40 is the best part}
{WHY ISN’T THIS AT 1B VIEWS 🤨 ???}
{2:06 2:15 Is probably the most symbolic part of the video. There is chaos and people screaming in the background, but when Glover puts his hands up and starts dancing with the kids, the screaming stops. He’s pulling our attention away.}
{Nu nuu🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪}

{I so forgot about this song this is America}
{Troy?}
{The revolution is being televised, time to reawaken this song!}
{Comments this fresh are crazy}
{wow ... I'm really surprised ... Just a piece of art, I'm Mexican ... But this just blowed my head ...no word !!!}
{Anyone in 2026}
{I need Gambino at the Super Bowl next year}
{I've watched this 987 times since the Superbowl}
{Every time America fucks up I find my ass right back here}
{Bro has the best song transition}
{2025 anyone else here}
{Each and every year I still there 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥}
{The entire video is art, and very haunting especially in the end like he represents his part of America waking into the nightmare seeing it as it really is, trying to escape, but he's being chased by everyone either to pull him back into the nightmare as blind as they are demanding he conforms or to rip him apart for everything that he himself is worth to them in the industry. Probably looking to deep into it, but here i am opening a dialog.}
{fevereiro 2025}
{Love this song}
{W song}
{This video is still under a billion views smh}
{" grampa told me get ur monet get ur money get ur black get ur money Get ur black man *shoots" was the best line ever}

{2025}
{When he gets on top the car, the man beside it has a bag over his face yet is still playing music. Maybe to represent how America treats african Americans vs how they treat the content they create}
{This is America}
{Brilliant}
{Did anyone hear 21 say straight up}
{Childish Gambino is so good I love it❤️}
{2026}
{Isn’t this the new GOP’s anthem? The reds sing it all together, and speaker Mike does the Glover part.}

{Hear me out here.....childish Gambino super bowl performance}
{Here before a billion views... oh and after the Superbowl performance by Kendrick 😂😂}
{Wtf frank ocin doing}
{You know that he was Troy in community}
{It's always black men like this that sing about wake up black people and than go be with another race of women lol yep this is America}
{I just realized this miles morales uncle.. in the Mcu at least}
{I'm so glad he didn't waste this masterpiece on Drake}
{Nobody: The tweaker at 3 AM:}
{One thing to mention is look at how the video is shot. We or the camera are/is so focused on Childish Gambino that we can’t really see all the chaos happening in the background.  This is a tell tale to people just loving Hip Hop but completely ignoring the violence against the very same people the music is enriching off of. Kinda reminds you of the song when Andre 3000 “y’all just want to dance” Also, those uniforms by the students. I haven’t seen US students wearing those uniforms but you know which country’s students wear them? South Africa and what is known about South Africa in terms of racial discrimination and hate? Apartheid.  Another thing is that Black and Red coloration for the choir is no hiccup but the more interesting part is why take the green out and replace it with white? Much to think on.}
{This started as a Drake diss 😂}
{So this is the reason why people start shooting out of nowhere}
{1:42 the best part}
{2025 HERE🚦}

{USA vs Canada tonight ..... Had to play this today}
{Now?}
{I understand why nobody likes this song, but at that time of the year, everyone was going was going through a lot. Like Covid. So I understand why this was made. This was to tell people the stuff that goes down in America}
{I remember the time of my life when this was released. I was homeless with my mom, dog, and cat. We stayed a month or so at my brother's/dad's apartment. I would listen to this song multiple times a day for weeks, on their balcony. It was a shitty situation but I kinda miss those days. Lots of memories and music.}
{Literally watching this over and over for my assessment!}
{America is a continent}
{bro he shot the guy so z3sty}
{I remember when this dropped and me and my friends, we were in like the 5th grade, kept watching it on our school laptops in shock. Bless our hearts 😂}

{I searched for "does rap music make you dumber" and this was the first thing I saw... People don't understand three important things about the industry. 1) It's actually a living entity. 2)It has intent and is very effective at what it does. And 3)Much like these social media platforms and entertainment mechanisms, it's all controlled by the same entities that cause you to not only feel you need to consume this garbage but makes sure you enjoy it. Now before someone pictures me as some entitled kid who grew up in the "upper class" suburbs, I'm going to say straight up that I grew up in the very areas that are targeted by these same people who put us there in the first place. Liberty City in the heart of places people were told to avoid in Miami, opa-locka where the concept of a "trap" was even thought up etc. I've been around since break dancing, listening to all this incoherent garbage from Africa bambata, e.p.m.d, scarface and the ghetto boys, sissy ass tpac and soft ass biggie, black rob, Busta, bone thugs, you name it. Very few gave an actual message that inspired thought like immoral technique and even he got some shit wrong because he believes the history he was told. I'm in my 50's now and it bothers me that an idiot rapping about having lean in his cup and gas in his tank like it's some kind of life achievement actually gets people to bob and dance to this mind numbing garbage. People, please pull your heads out of your asses,  wake up and open your eyes and minds. And I mean wake up as to become conscious not "woke" and do what you think people want youbto do. There isn't anything wrong with being an individual. One person can out think a "collective" of brain dead robots in the first 2 seconds of rolling out of bed. How much brain power can YOU use?... I hope young people read this and see that these people you idolize are phony as a three dollar bill. Rapping about robbing, slinging dope, doing time and all the things they've never experienced in reality. It all comes from the mind of some industry goon in a suit writing their lyrics for them.}

{This is brutal}
{seeing everyone back here within the last month. yep this is america for sure.}
{Years late, but there are always levels. This guy is dancing, finding something about his worth, feeling the music, while death and chaos are surrounding him. This is Black American history! Finding something during the horror. Developing this beautiful genre of music, something distinctly Black, while being murdered, subjugated, and bar-coded.}
{Kendrick should have invited Donald Glover to do the half time show with him and done this song.}
{Industry plant.clown funny how no one sees it..hes not talking about upgrading the american blacks..dumb ass repetive  bullshhii}

{This Is The same Guy From A Spider man Movie💀💀💀}
{Why is this not a Fortnite emoteerl}
{love this}
{2025 I'm here! Crazy I sought this video out again because I felt the connection too. I wish Childish Gambino was the guest addition to the Superbowl. After Kendrick I wish Samuel Jackson would have said that statement about America and then with SZA already onstage she's on the car singing the "whoooo tell somebody" part and then Childish Gambino pops up on top of another car doing his dance moves. That would have been a nice dope blend of a great collab where you have to think 🤔 when you watch them perform! The stadium would have lost it! 😍}
{My ng don is zesty as hell 😂}

{I'm in 2025}
{Present}
{damn ‘till this day it looks so realistic}
{I like the Japanese version more🤡}
{I lived in Los Angeles 20 years ago because of my parents' work. I was bullied terribly at school and on the streets because I was Japanese. I am an adult now, and I am now doing bitcoin and stocks. I wish for the development of the U.S., but I still have a feeling of hatred. Even in the Czech Republic and Munich, I hear, "There are Japanese people here! Disgusting!" and I was bullied, so maybe the problem is not so much with America, but with white people as a whole.}

{Donald Glover e Kendrick Lamar merecem todo o reconhecimento ambos entregam toda a verdade em letras e nos clipes.}
{Uma obra de arte!}
{2025 we are here.}
{I watch this probably every other year and every time I’m reminded that you truly need to watch it multiple times every watch through. If you’re just now finding this song, I’d recommend watching the foreground, the background, an analysis video about it and honestly watching this video again. It’s so rich in symbolism that it definitely deserves the time to be appreciated!}

{The Super Bowl and this song deep truth of being black the mental gymnastics and history we get in the school are watered down at let’s Donald and Kendrick keep on addressing it in their art}
{All these years and no one is talking about he had SZA in here}
{Is it just me or this is the guy that was from Spider-Man homecoming?}

{this is the most brilliant music video i have ever seen.}
{Trump pointing at the Gulf of Mexico, Greenland, and Canada: This is America}
{How is this guy not on the CIA watchlist}
{Kendrick should’ve brought this out}
{2025 is the right time to listen to this song in my opinion}
{I’m an arts teacher in France and I show this to my students to study symbolism in modern day media. Works wonders because it’s very much their time, music they can easily relate to and events they can refer to with social media and all of that.}
{Killer finish EVERYONE was waiting for it indeed Game Over}
{Messages here  1) huge amounts of gun violence especially around the youth.  2) the youth is distracted with tik Tok and dancing to where they've become blinded and immune to gun violence.  3) black Churches are being shot up and the actual murder is walking away from the scene unscathed, you see people and cops charging towards the choir in anger instead of giving aid or being astonished, thus saying its secretly supportted.  4) he say he's pretty he's fitted he's got a nice car he's driving hes litt. Meanwhile all this stuff is going on. This is how typical Americans are. Only worried about material over real-world stuff that goes on. The song also starts with "we just want the money we just want to party. Party just for me." 5) peaceful people are dying and it's being covered up 6) complete chaos  7) he says "this a celly" then shows kids hanging around and dancing. schools are little prisons. Black Kids Set up for failure kind of thing.  8) in the end it will lead to an apocalypse hence why the cars are scattered in a disarray like they've just been abandoned and no one actually cares  9) "on my Kodak" = everyone's drugged out 10) but I mean hey as long as the kids can dance and you're pretty who cares?}
{2025?✋️}
{as timeless as Fight Club, will always be relevant. fuck the corpo chooms}
{Had to come back and watch this after watching the halftime show for the fifth time.}
{I feel like at the Super Bowl the halftime show should have been Oliver Anthony singing Richmond north of Richmond and then a break-up point where it's like no this is the new America and this song should have played or something not another platform for Kendrick to repeat the same beef with Drake and illicit some message that he's not actually clarifying with people so it's just leaves people conversating and arguing instead of just being proud of our country.}
{Damn it's been 6 yrs already? Remembering first time watching this clip and my jaw dropping and then watching it few more times to digest it all lol}
{Almost a billion viiiiiews.  How many of you here because of Kendricks halftime show?}

{TIA}
{😅😮😮}
{End of this is SZA in 3:24  she’s sitting on the car}
{Who came here from a short}
{Interesting thing to note... I fell away from rap music after gangster rap turned into this explosion of glorifying the horrors of the hood and the degradation of black women. God Bless 80s and 90s Hip Hop. Could there be a return to the glory of hip hop with Kendrick? BUT... Gonna be real with you all... I'm hard of hearing... As is an 82 year old lady whose dog I walk... She actually watched the Superbowl (I did not) and reported the performance was very well choreographed but did NOT understand anything Lamar actually SAID!  As a member of the hearing loss community, I can appreciate how hard it can be to receive a "message" that you cannot hear? 🤔 The visuals were great and I imagine Kendrick (not knowing any of his music) was rapping some very profound words. However, most old white Americans (aka a good chunk of the Superbowl) are NOT familiar with hip hop and CANNOT appreciate what he is actually saying due to poor hearing ability! What a difference it might have made if Lamar has found a way to make sure his words were received LOUD and CLEAR... Subtitles on the tv at least? Have a screen up that shows the lyrics for those in the audience? Can't fault people for not being literally unable to hear! Break that "sound barrier" and the Super Bowl would have slayed.}

{I m'a'n d'z a rie sou @}
{Anyone coming back here after Kendrick Superbowl 2025?}
{I remember even in my little rightwing streak I listened to this song wanting to be mad at its criticisms of the US, but couldn't disagree with it at all.}
{Powerful imagery but this video always struck me as ultimately shallow. One of the more privileged nepo-baby actors decided to pretend at being a pop/hip-hop star for a couple months, released a provocative video to a mediocre song, and thats basically it. Honestly, its not a great song. My opinion.}
{Gayest dance moves ever 🤦‍♂️ even when it released those dance moves were gay af}

{The worst part is other than americans everybody knows this is america}

{DONALD TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP}
{I knew I wasn't tripping everybody else. Wanted to hear this song after the super bowl too because You're not like us reminds you of this song.}
{Donald, when you first came out with this song, none of that distortion with the other voices were not in this song. What is that Donald.}
{I still remember doing a presentation in class about everything this video went through. I wasn't sure at first, but the careful use of EVERYTHING in this video still shakes me to my core. From the 17 seconds of silence for the parkland shooting, to the gang violence looming around the corner in a few shots, the horseman of the apocalypse, death coming through on a horse, etc. Everything here has a purpose from the main shot, to what happens in the background. I love this video for what it critiques about today and if you look up any analysis online, look up one for this. It was crazy coming out when it did but still holds true as a little time capsule today.}
{America is gun violent hellscape.}
{I had no business being obsessed with thing song at 8 years old}

{This song has really died in the arse, another leftist piece of bullshit just to conform to their fucked up beliefs. I listened to so much cool music in the late 80s/early 90s, DelaSoul, Pharcyde, Tribe called Quest but this is such a wank piece of "oh woah is my race" and the people who lapped it up were white, middle class, privileged Americans...the exact people it was aimed against}

{Highly recommend watching the show Atlanta if you vibe with the commentary in this. Glover gets at some of these same topics in ways that blew my mind.  Many season 3 and 4 episodes are “stand alone” and don’t require watching the previous seasons. Three Slaps, The Big Paycheck, Trini to de Bone, to name a few…}

{Who is here before valtines day}
{Not enough people talk about how damaging the fake “white cops kill black people” narrative (which this video at least partly eludes to) was.  Stories that fit that narrative were cherry picked and brought to the masses, causing a snowball affect of confirmation bias that this was an exclusively white on black phenomenon. I remember people gradually quit thinking critically about what actually happened in those police killings because they saw the explicitly white on black trend as evidence enough of that white cops just like killing blacks.  It's a very destructive narrative because even if a neutral observation of all police shooting would show that it happens disproportionately to blacks (idk if it does or doesn't), that's a mile away from "it only happens to blacks". The George Floyd summer would probably not have happened (or at least be tolerated) if people like Tony Timpa had equal coverage.}

{When you don't have much in your life, you'll chase opiates and distractions.

{On January 20th, 2025, Donald J. Trump was inaugurated as 47th President of the United States of America. Since then, a series of shocking events have occurred in a matter of 14 days since his inauguration (as of February 2nd, 2025). Trump claimed he had no association with the Project 2025 Mandate for Leadership manifesto, and yet a majority of his initial Executive Orders and actions as President over the last two weeks directly correlate to the contents within the manifesto. The actions of this administration since its conception in 2016, and more notably as of 2025, are directly congruous with Fascist ideology, alluding to the dangers of Donald Trump, and the agenda he is currently enacting. Capitalism is in decline in the United States, marked by rampant cronyism, corruption, oligarchy, social unrest, extreme polarization, massive wealth inequality, an undermined working class, erosion of democracy, a rampant housing crisis, and inflation. The United States of America is reaching a critical point in its history.}
{The South/Central American and Carribean response....another group of people who are hurt by USA geopolitical fkery. Military Coup, BS embargo's, etc...}
{Yeah black people unaliving every race. How is this a black anthem against cops or white people? I know the stats bro. Black people know the stats bro.}
{0:52 trump for no reason}
{En realidad llegué aquí por una influencer que da a conocer libros prohibidos en Trump 2 y se escucha esta canción en el post. La pena es que el tipo es más abierto en reconocer. Otras sociedades solo invisibilizan temas y elijen unos libros por sobre otros o cambian la verdadera fisonomía y alma de los personajes. Una especie de detrás del libro fake. Sobre el artista y video genial aún me da miedo.}
{Well, as most people have probably noted, America, is falling apart quickly.}
{The energy is insane 🔥}
{In this current era, this applies well not to the "American Dream" but the American Nightmare of school shootings/gun violences, poverty, racisim, and avaricie.}

{Nice song but…… One plus one is a fundamental mathematical operation known as addition. Specifically, it involves combining two single-unit quantities into a single group. In numerical terms, the operation is expressed as 1 + 1. When you add one to another one, the result is two, which can be represented numerically as "2". This operation is often one of the first arithmetic concepts taught in early education due to its simplicity and foundational role in more complex mathematical concepts. Visualizing one plus one can be as simple as imagining two individual apples being placed together in a basket; if you start with one apple and add another, you end up with two apples total. This concept applies universally across objects and scenarios. The principle of one plus one extends beyond numbers alone; it can be seen in various real-life applications. For example, combining one person with another person results in a pair. In essence, the idea of one plus one is a building block for understanding how quantities combine and grow, offering a straightforward yet crucial insight into the world of mathematics and arithmetic operations.}

{when this first released i was pretty far down a republican pipeline (parent's opinions, local community, and overall lack of critical thinking) and i have to say i think it started me navigating down the right path. watching analysis after analysis and slowly learning the systemic problems of our country really reshaped my brain. now that i finally understand the significance and background of this, it's even more haunting looking from the future in a world where fascism seems to be ever increasingly popular. if you voted for trump and think my opinion is me being some "woke libtard" or whatever, go argue with a wall or listen to the experiences of those who you voted against}

{Trump = Nazism}
{Week 1 of the Trump administration: 1) Widespread ICE raids and deportations, except they're deporting Americans, including Native Americans and Hispanics who have been here generations. 2) Trump froze ALL federal grant payments, including for higher education, special education, food aid, medical research, and other vital services. States like Washington are suing and demanding that he release payments-which have already been allocated and approved by Congress. 3) The press secretary announced that egg prices are high because the previous admin. allowed widespread culling of herds due to bird flu. Their plan is to ignore bird flu and allow flu-ridden eggs to poison the human food supply, threatening public health. 4) The press secretary announced that birthright citizenship is out of step with the Trump administration's legal framework and out of step with the constitution-even though it's LITERALLY IN THE CONSTITUTION. 5) Sam Altman and Elon Musk are fighting over who gets the AI infrastructure contracts. Low-key rumors that AI infrastructure means Neurolink for everyone, against our will, along with ubiquituous surveillance. 6) Pete Hegseth was appointed SecDef, despite being the most unqualified perhaps in American history. 7)Kristi Noem, the new Homeland Security Sec., walked out on her first day on the job to the country song, "Hot Mama" before going on an ICE raid to "catch dirtbags". This is America. 1/28/2025 Help me keep it up to date.}

And it's really sad that we are willing to speak to other cultures of people and be accepting of them and help them out before we do our own people. We are still our worst enemies!}

{Just saw Elon Musk hit the Nazi salute. Thought I’d come here to help cope}
{The only thing the trump has announced was stupid was changing the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America. He announced securing the Southern borders, and more to come. Lowering the inflation. And even if there's something kinda bad that he plans to do, I feel like people missed the point of this song. To me it feels like he's saying "hey, we're all about laughs and good times, but don't do something stupid or we will fight back" every backup dancer runs we he even makes the sound of a gun, meaning they are scared that he'll even shoot them for fun.}
{This vid is not only a work of art, it speaks VOLUMES OF OUR HISTORY AS A PEOPLES IN A NATION BORN OF THEFT, GENOCIDE AND WAR...😐}

{Is the name Childish Gambino a reference to Piece Hawthorne Boat in the Community tv show?}

{Essa música é muito boa}

{Its 2025 and i still don't know if Donald would be Happy or saddened by how much everyone liked this song  Also wild to see him go from nephew to unc}
{I paid checks of unlimited child support to the universes and i got to 😮love my children i wanted to go to a party and have fun like I want! I want try to get my packages! I need my birthday packages! I need help with star wars too. The movie the neighbors is a good movie but what happened to the neighbors. I need help there tho. My brother Tyler Perry I need your help with someone looking for bad comments with me! I need peace and relaxation! Love you bro just wanna go make love!}
{This song came out during a difficult time for me. I nearly couldn't watch this video, and it ended up being more cathartic than I expected. This is only my second viewing, years later, and it's... hard to articulate how not only still necessary this work is (it's way more than just "a music video" imo) but, like many have said, how much worse we seem to be in this our American society... I'm still looking over my shoulder. It's rough.}
{👁️🐷👁️}
{How did the community star become the face of this mm mmm}
{😂 The vibe? Okay he said blacks get yo money at the very end. I feel like he know they get a share of it all too 😂 Overall they are not wrong about the line "Dont catch you slippin though! They gonna get you back and this is truly America. 😅 I dont believe any of this or him. There is good hearts deep in the Roots of AMERICA ❤}
{"Gambino, mi hermano Esto sí es América"}
{That lighter flick diabolical 😂}
{Who else is here 2025 jan 16}
{What I took from this video is that, the establishment uncle toms  (which he and his crew of swanky dressed dancers represent) enforce "America".  The man in the beginning, offering  an "alternative message", to unify under was killed by the establishment after being taken unjust prisoner, after which "THIS IS AMERICA starts playing" Then, the Church that offers another message to unify under- killed, and  THIS IS AMERICA" starts playing - like no alternative narratives allowed. Notice how they keep saying "tell somebody" - the guitar player started to and was killed before he got an audience. the choir started to and was killed before they got an audience.  then in the end of the video the uncle toms are running...... whatver the establishment decides to do with them, there will come more of our own to enforce the establishments wishes against us.}
{I was on the cusp of being famous, but them whitey people got in the way.}
{First time listening, at first i thought, this music is shit. But then i realized that it is about the real America.}

Not that the rest isn’t also great… but I’m having a really hard time finding African specific music that isn’t a live demonstration… so like a recording studio version that clean of background sounds or static from the environment.}

{Donald Glover is not Childish Gambino, he is a god I don't know yet}
{I love coming back to this whenever the USA is in the shit.}
{This hits harder than I remember}
{I love the political commentary here. In the beginning he executes the guitarist for an unknown reason and starts singing to distract us while the people in the background clean up the mess. Immediately after there's some gang sh*t going on in the background, but it's blurry and out of focus. Then he transitions you back into that soft melody from earlier, only to break you out of it with gunshots where he literally shoots the church choir and changes the drum track again. While he walks around a car is on fire in the background, there's a police car, but all the while he is just singing and dancing distracting us people are in the background just out of focus. It's almost like he's saying without saying that this is all just a distraction.}
{People have no idea, every time a song like this comes out, it's a reminder that we're still black in America! You listen to Fox and the rest of whites on the right, they keep saying, America doesn't see color! You can't help but to LOL! We try our damness to move forward with free thinking and new incident, reminds you, you're still black! Back to square one! On the violence that knows no color, mass shootings and so on, America was born by the gun and will die by the gun. In 2025, this couldn't be more relevant, America is dividing in sections mentally and song will be the poster boy of what's to come. Don't let them catch you slippin. Load up!}

{Hello who here in december}
{omg rip}
{Watching 'This Is America' in 2024 feels like catching your reflection in a funhouse mirror – except the funhouse is on fire, and the mirror's showing nothing but facts. Gambino wasn't predicting the future; he was reading our receipt. Between tech bros playing musical chairs with congressional testimonies and billionaires treating space like their personal Coachella, we're living in the director's cut of Gambino's fever dream. The song hits harder now that we're all extras in the music video – dancing our way through late-stage capitalism like it's a TikTok challenge. The real gag? While Gambino's dancing through chaos, we've upgraded to a full apocalyptic ballet.

{Watching 'This Is America' in 2024 feels like catching your reflection in a funhouse mirror – except the funhouse is on fire, and the mirror's showing nothing but facts. Gambino wasn't predicting the future; he was reading our receipt. Between tech bros playing musical chairs with congressional testimonies and billionaires treating space like their personal Coachella, we're living in the director's cut of Gambino's fever dream. The song hits harder now that we're all extras in the music video – dancing our way through late-stage capitalism like it's a TikTok challenge. The real gag? While Gambino's dancing through chaos, we've upgraded to a full apocalyptic ballet.

My name starts with "J" too... if anyone still cares about spelling or education... or History. What would you (UT) do?  BYOB 2 BYU? Cannabis is in play in Utah. They also have a Harvey Milk Blvd. Punks too. Is the Tourism board hiring? Or is that too strong of a political role for me too? ;) How do character KPIs work?

{Rememebr guys: the dems were the kkk members and the slave masters. They were never for the people. We cant get decent helathcare vut kamala wanted prisoners to get sex change on our dime. Trump is no saint but a better option for now. Biden was sponsored by the grand master of the kkk and no kne batted an eye. He also sat there on camera molesting kids and no one cared. Kamala wanted men to be women so it was easier to take over a bunch of sissy boys.}

{Name ONE THING, anything, that the Democrat Party has ever positively done for Black America. Democrats owned us, fought to keep us slaves, and still do everything they can to keep us on the plantation. Republicans fought to free us, give us equal rights, and we never did better than we did under Trump and that’s a fact. THAT’S why you are seeing so many of us open our eyes and become conservatives.}
{é o young thug que canta no final ?????}
{Sometimes, we watch a video or read something somewhere and react immediately and impulsively, and after reacting this way, we feel that we were wrong in doing so. Often, it doesn't have anything to do with us, and we feel really bad and sorry about it afterward. I need to keep in mind that our views can really upset others. And if I'm feeling this way by simply typing a comment, I can imagine how bad it must feel to be a target or targets of such a comment, when again, said targets have nothing to do with us. I formed my opinion based on others' opinions and should have done my own research. A few hours ago, I had made a really uninformed, immature, unfounded and baseless claim on world affairs and commented it. Again, I'm extremely sorry about posting such a stupid comment. I am no one to judge anybody. I am really, very extremely sorry.}

{This song is what fucked everything up from Nepo Baby Donald Glover}
{As a white man brought up in the school system in CT which is considered to this day separatist, no one knew we were being fashioned racists. The black community was introduced to white people over 8 channels of projected tragedy as entertainment. The kids I grew up around were told a very different tale regarding history. Christopher Columbus, as if there isn't a halo around a person who committed genocide against a peaceful group of people in the name of greed now has a scribble on the relevance of "Columbus Day" being insultingly entangled to a day respecting him and the people he erased isn't enough to realize history is in the opinion and property of its owners.   Many of us were raised racist without knowing it. Lincoln didn't end slavery for the respect of humans being human it was an economic move. ...I grew up a white boy but later lived in cities where the population was not familiar and already had experience with a racism I didn't know and a sledgehammer of reality hit quickly. The division is on both sides. "Get that money, black man" is a cavalcade that includes white people. We are all a part of the corporation competition called Different Countries. On a global scale it's easier to apply economics to the competition that creates wars. Pride in our countries has merit, don't get me wrong but it's essentially faith or reliance or blind belief that the governing body keeps us in a comfy spot.  Yes a difference between us can be a disconcerting thing but it's far more encouraged then the children we were understanding became part of us as adults.}

As a European, dear citizens of the USA, or at least half of you who didn't vote for Trump and seek redemption in this video..., please try to understand your fellow Americans who DID vote for him. Try to understand the fears, concerns of the majority of the citizens in your great country. Yes, Trump has some ugly sides in his character, but imagine how little the Dems expressed solutions to their problems. Real, every day Problems not shown in this video.  Some self critcism would do you some good. Americans are a proud, free, optimistic nation. Stop whining. And the rest of the world needs a healthy proud USA.}

Everything is about either money, sex and drugs. Never about morals, compassion, virtues, honesty and integrity.

One pretends while the other hates openly. Both are just as the same}

{Donald glover was really ahead of time with all of this, I can’t say this enough but. This video really hits differently when America events happen.}
{You Mother Fuckers Only Spam For USA And You Put Over Than Likes}
{six years later and this is still america}
{I wonder if the irony that it's a black man shooting other blacks is registering with viewers.}
{🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯}

{Song's views after this election. 📈}
{here we are again….}
{The fact sza in the music video crazy}
{"north america"}
{Kamala gave a good fight. Two black women voted to the senate. One trans woman elected to congress. Progress not perfection! We are moving there eventually. Please do not give up hope. Most of those who did not vote, don't realize that their vote DOES MATTER! Ambivalence does not help anyone. We got this America. Get people to vote educate we have 4 years to prepare!}
{The "This Is America" Cycle. 1. America does something profoundly stupid. 2. We all come to this video for emotional release. Rinse and Repeat. The tune's going to outlive America itself.}
{so we all just here?}
{we just want the money, money just for you~}
{come back}
{This song has been ringing in my head since America decided to re-elect a convicted felon, insurrectionist, racist and the author of an agenda that he vehemently denied any knowledge of. We're going to be leaning on God now more than ever. This is America}
{Of course we didn’t elect a woman that’s a prosecutor for president but instead the white, racist, misogynistic convicted felon for the second time.}
{it’s depressing that this just keeps getting more relevant}

{Guys if you care, go volunteer for organizations you care about to help marginalized groups. You have to inform people even more now how the republican party dgaf about them or them being poor. Democrats need to step up their game this time. And no I don’t want to hear the BS that both parties are the same because Trump will teach you that. If you’re a minority of any kind, they fkn hate you. They will use you until they get what they want and then throw you. Learn people learn.}

{November 2024 anyone?}
{I’m curious how I haven’t seen this interpretation of the blunt part of the video - Now I’m not from America and im just a broke white dude, but it seemed to me, that as soon as the problem got exposed to him by the people or maybe friends he’s been dancing wit all run away and he has to face or comprehend the problem - He rolls up a joint and the man HE killed is now alive again - seems to me like - as soon as the things gets too real and has to be handled he rolls up the blunt and it is as nothing has happened. Seems to me as a way of neglecting the problems just to cope. Reality in America is too tough man… And prescription drugs are just there to escape and neglect the harsh society.. Really damn wish u the best Americans}

Yet, the people are dancing with him, celebrating him, instead of blaming him. Interesting, self reflective and controversial message about a greed-driven and self destructive culture.}

{American music forms: Spirituals,, Blues, Ragtime, Jazz, Country,, Gospel, Bluegrass, Folk, Rock n Roll, Doo-Wop, Soul, Funk, Disco, Punk, House and of course Rap and Hip Hop---all enjoy well documented Black American roots coupled with undeniable Black American influence---whether directly or indirectly.. Latinos -- puerto ricans particularly  --  explain how you co-created or co-invented yet another installment in the legacy of Black musical expression known as Rap and Hip Hop, yet didn't co-create or co-invent any of the elements of the 14 or so Black American music forms that preceeded it? Or why you were nowhere to be found and absent during the creative and inventive foundation outlining the forms of Black American musical expression, brilliance and greatness throughout, or even prior to the previous 14 or so Black American music forms that are mentioned above. Yet then, all of a sudden--out of nowhere, you folks come along and falsely claim latinos and/or puerto ricans co-created and co-invented Rap and Hip Hop 50/50 half n half (which is the evidence-free and utter nonsense being peddled by derrick colon, radical latino, fat joe and numerous other un-informed and envious latinos. And these of course are claims latinos never mentioned, verbalized or asserted during its inception in the early 1970's). Latinos/puerto rican claims of "50/50--half & half co-creation and co-invention just don't add up---it makes no sense and are increasingly coming under heavy scrutiny which is leading to these claims being easily debunked--as they should've been. Moreover, the heavily hateful and many times racist criticism directed at the Black American youth by the racist white media over having created Rap and Hip Hop, latinos -- particularly puerto ricans -- and jamaicans NEVER came forward to denounce the vicious onslaught---yet 50 years later you want to take credit for this FBA art form that you didn't create...}

{When I was younger, I didn't quite understand this video in the way it was meant to be understood. When I was a teenager (which was how old I was when this came out), I thought this video was just about how Black people are disproportionately affected by systemic issues in this country. Now, at the age of 23, rewatching this before the 2024 general election... I realize that this video is about the hypocrisy of consuming Black culture (which we all do to some extent through our media), giving superficial nods to Black artists who graciously expose us to their culture, and then us doing absolutely NOTHING to change the systemic brutalization of Black people. I'm grateful to all of the perspectives I've encountered that have helped me understand, even just a little bit, about how important it is to pay attention to things like this, and vote in a way that benefits us all, not just me.}

This song always takes me back to when I was 18 in 2018 during my senior year of high school and I first watched listened to this song and watched this music video the day it released back on May 5th of 2018 the month before my high school graduation in June of 2018. He is music has always been fantastic and I always love him in the show Community and his sense of humor. It was really cool to also see him make the jump to Star Wars in 2018 in the movie Solo👏🏿. I really hope he gets another chance to play and portray Lando Calrissian, I was so disappointed that his stand-alone Lando film with Donald Glover as the main character was cancelled.}
