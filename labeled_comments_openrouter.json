This is song is crazy. Metaphors, multiple antondres etc. Wish more people would look into this song more. Once you do you underatand more of the lines and the brilliance of it. The venom in this song is once you start listening to his music it gets stuck in your head and gives you the will to fight back and more. Like with the kid he starts breaking things which when he came out he got blamed for kids showing aggression, school shootings, doing drugs and so much more. It was a crazy period. Ive been on this ride with Em since the first time I heard him. Even got the MMLP EP on cassette. He's a genius."

People say he got killed but  Em had a reply (probably at least 3-4) full tilt knock outs ready when he put it out. Think about it.  I'm not a big fan of mumblers myself but I have found that sometimes I really dig their back beats instead of vocals so it's a worthy sound for that. Eminem should maybe be a bit forgiving of a kid who has lived a life really similarly and actually had idolized him (and accept that his daughters are physically pleasing to the eye for guys). There's been a  lot of tear down in the past rap genre so why isn't there more building up? Why isn't Em old enough & man enough to help change these guys one on one versus ripping them up? And don't get me wrong cause I love hearing Em's stuff. But I love a TON of music across all spectrum of sound for different reasons.  My 2 cents which are worth the aluminum in the coin."

Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I can't tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight High off of love, drunk from her hate It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her, the more I suffer I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me And I love it, \"Wait Where you going?\" \"I'm leaving you\" \"No you ain't, come back\" We're running right back, here we go again It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad, it's awful I feel so ashamed, I snapped, \"Who's that dude?\" I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em? You meet, and neither one of you, even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah, them chills, used to get 'em Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face Spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over, it controls you both So they say you're best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday Yesterday is over, it's a different day Sound like broken records playin' over But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean  Then we fall back into the same patterns Same routine, but your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded Baby, please come back, it wasn't you Baby, it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time I apologize, even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie"

I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face, Spewing venom in your words, when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over it controls you both So they say it's best, to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday Yesterday is over, it's a different day Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her Next time you'll show restraint You don't get another chance Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again Now you get to watch her leave Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded Baby please come back, it wasn't you Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall Next time, there will be no next time I apologize even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie"

But that's alright because I like the way it hurts Tak mengapa karena aku suka rasa sakitnya Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Hanya akan berdiri di situ dan mendengarku menangis? But that's alright because I love the way you lie Tak mengapa karena aku suka caramu berbohong I love the way you lie Aku suka caramu berbohong I can't tell you what it really is Tak bisa kukatakan padamu yang sebenarnya I can only tell you what it feels like Yang bisa kukatakan hanyalah seperti apa rasanya And right now there's a steel knife Dan saat ini seperti ada pisau baja In my windpipe Di tenggorokanku I can't breathe Aku tak bisa bernafas But I still fight Namun aku masih berjuang While I can fight Saat aku masih bisa berusaha As long as the wrong feels right Selama yang salah tidak masalah It's like I'm in flight Rasanya aku sedang terbang High of a love Tinggi dalam cinta Drunk from the hate Mabuk dari rasa benci It's like I'm huffin' paint Rasanya aku sedang marah And I love it the more that I suffer Dan aku semakin suka saat aku menderita I suffocate Aku tercekik And right before I'm about to drown Dan tepat sebelum aku akan tenggelam She resuscitates me Dia menyadarkanku She fucking hates me Dia sangat membenciku And I love it Dan aku suka itu Wait Tunggu Where you going Mau kemana kau I'm leaving you Aku kan tinggalkanmu No you ain't Takkan kau lakukan Come back Kembalilah We're running right back Kita berlari kembali Here we go again Kita mulai lagi It's so insane Sangat tak waras Cause when it's going good Karena saat semua berjalan baik It's going great Semua luar biasa I'm Superman Aku superman With the wind at his back Dengan angin di punggungnya She's Lois Lane Dia Lois Lane But when it's bad Namun saat keadaan buruk It's awful Sungguh mengerikan I feel so ashamed Aku merasa sangat malu I snap Aku berteriak Who's that dude Siapa pria itu I don't even know his name Aku bahkan tak tahu namanya I laid hands on her Kutaruh tangan padanya I'll never stoop so low again Aku takkan membungkuk begitu rendah lagi I guess I don't know my own strength Kukira aku tak tahu kekuatanku sendiri [CHORUS] You ever love somebody so much Kau pernah sangat mencintai seseorang You can barely breathe Hingga kau hampir tak bisa bernafasWhen you're with them Saat kau bersamanya You meet Kalian bertemu And neither one of you Dan di antara kalian  Even know what hit 'em Tak ada yang tahu apa yang kalian rasa Got that warm fuzzy feeling Kau rasa hangat  Yeah them chills ya, mereka kedinginan Used to get 'em Kalian dulu biasa begitu Now you're getting fucking sick Kini kalian sakit Of looking at 'em Melihat mereka You swore you've never hit 'em Kalian bersumpah tak mau lagi bertemu merekaNever do nothing to hurt 'em Tak mau menyakiti mereka Now you're in each other's face Kini kalian berhadapan Spewing venom Memuntahkan bisa In Your words Dalam kata-katamu When you spit 'em Saat kau ludahkan You push Kau saling dorong Pull each other's hair Saling tarik rambut Scratch, claw, bit 'em Garuk, cakar, pukul Throw 'em down Jatuhkan Pin 'em PutarSo lost in the moments Hilang kendali When you're in 'em Saat kau dalam emosi It's the rage that took over Rasa marah yang mengambil kendali It controls you both Mengendalikan kalian berdua So they say it's best Maka mereka berkata yang terbaik To go your separate ways Adalah berpisah Guess that they don't know ya Mereka pasti tak kenal kalianCause today Karena hari ini That was yesterday Itu adalah kemarin Yesterday is over Kemarin tlah usai It's a different day Ini hari lain Sound like broken records Seperti pecah rekor Playing' over Permainan usai But you promised her Namun kau berjanji padanya Next time you'll show restraint Lain kali kau akan menahan diri You don't get another chance Kau tak dapat kesempatan lain Life is no Nintendo game Hidup bukanlah game Nintendo But you lied again Namun kau berbohong lagi Now you get to watch her leave Kini kau harus saksikan dia berlalu Out the window Dari balik jendela Guess that's why they call it window pane Mungkin itulah kenapa disebut panel jendela [CHORUS] Now I know we said things Kini aku tahu kita mengatakan banyak hal Did things Melakukan banyak hal That we didn't mean Yang tak kita inginkan And we fall back Dan kita ulangi Into the same patterns Ke dalam pola yang sama Same routine Rutinitas yang sama But your temper's just as bad Namun temperamenmu tetap sama buruk As mine is Sepertiku You're the same as me Kau sama denganku But when it comes to love Namun saat tentang cinta You're just as blinded Kau sama butanya Baby please come back Kasih kembalilah It wasn't you Bukan engkau Baby it was me Akulah Maybe our relationship Mungkin hubungan kita Isn't as crazy as it seems Tak segila kelihatannya Maybe that's what happens Mungkin itulah yang terjadi When a tornado meets a volcano Saat topan bertemu gunung berapi All I know is Yang kutahu I love you too much Aku sangat mencintaimu To walk away though Jangan pergi Come inside Masuklah Pick up your bags off the sidewalk Ambillah tasmu dari jalan ituDon't you hear sincerity Tidakkah kau dengar ketulusan In my voice when I talk Dalam suaraku saat bicara Told you this is my fault Kukatakan padamu ini salahku Look me in the eyeball Tataplah bola mataku Next time I'm pissed Lain kali jika aku marah I'll aim my fist Kan kuarahkan tinjuku At the dry wall Ke dinding Next time Lain kali There will be no next time Takkan ada lain kali I apologize Aku minta maaf Even though I know it's lies Meski kutahu saat ini aku bohong I'm tired of the games Aku lelah dengan permainan I just want her back Aku hanya ingin dia kembali I know I'm a liar Aku tahu aku pembohong If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again Jika dia mencoba pergi lagi I'mma tie her to the bed Kan kuikat dia di ranjangAnd set this house on fire Dan kubakar rumah ini"

I'm leaving you No you ain't, come back We're running right back, here we go again It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad, it's awful I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude? I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face, Spewing venom in your words, when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over it controls you both So they say it's best, to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday Yesterday is over, it's a different day Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her Next time you'll show restraint You don't get another chance Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again Now you get to watch her leave Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded Baby please come back, it wasn't you Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall Next time, there will be no next time I apologize even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie"

I'm leaving you No you ain't, come back We're running right back, here we go again It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad, it's awful I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude? I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face, Spewing venom in your words, when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over it controls you both So they say it's best, to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday Yesterday is over, it's a different day Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her Next time you'll show restraint You don't get another chance Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again Now you get to watch her leave Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded Baby please come back, it wasn't you Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall Next time, there will be no next time I apologize even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie"

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I can't tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight High off of love drunk from my hate It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me And I love it, wait Where you going? I'm leaving you No you ain't, come back We're running right back, here we go again It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad, it's awful I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude? I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face, Spewing venom in your words, when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over it controls you both So they say it's best, to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday Yesterday is over, it's a different day Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her Next time you'll show restraint You don't get another chance Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again Now you get to watch her leave Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded Baby please come back, it wasn't you Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall Next time, there will be no next time I apologize even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I felt that..."

Gdje ćeš Ostavljaš me? E pa nećeš. Vrati se! Idemo ispočetka Evo idemo ponovo Ludo je Jer kad ide dobro Ide super Ja sam Supermen Sa vjetrom u leđima Ona je Lois Lane Ali kad je loše Grozno je Osjećam se tako sramotno Puknem Ko je taj lik? Ne znam mu ni ime Digao sam ruku na nju Nikad nisam otišao tako nisko Izgleda da ne znam svoju moć   Samo ćeš stojati tu i gledati me kako gorim No nema veze, jer volim kako me boli Samo ćeš stojati tu i čuti me kako plačem No nema veze, jer volim kako me lažeš Volim kako lažeš Volim kako lažeš   Jesi li ikad volio ikog toliko Da jedva dišeš kad si sa tom osobom Sretite se I nijedno od vas Ne zna šta vam je Imate taj čudni ugodni osjećaj? Da, ti trnci Dobijao sam ih Sada vam je muka kad je vidite Zakleli ste se da nećete je nikad udariti Nikad nećete uraditi ništa da je povrijedite Sada ste jedno ispred drugoj Pljujete otrov dok pričate Gurate se Vučete za kosu Režite, ujedate, grebete Bacate Udarate Izgubljeni u trenutku Kad ste u njima Silina je pobijedila Kontrolila vas oboje Kažu da je najbolje Da se razdvojite Izgleda da te ne znaju Jer danas to je bilo juče Juče je gotovo Drugi je dan A zvuči kao pokvarene ploče Koje sviraju iznova Ali obećali ste joj Sljedeći put ćete se obuzdati Nema druge šanse Život nije Nintendo igra Ali lagali ste ponovo Sada je gledate kako bježi kroz prozor Izgleda da za to i služi   Samo ćeš stojati tu i gledati me kako gorim No nema veze, jer volim kako me boli Samo ćeš stojati tu i čuti me kako plačem No nema veze, jer volim kako me lažeš Volim kako lažeš Volim kako lažeš   Znam da smo rekli uradili što nismo mislili I sad se bacamo nazad U iste tragove Istu rutinu Ali tvoja narav je grozna baš kao i moja Ista si ja Ali kada je u pitanju ljubav Slijepa si,kao ja Dušo , molim te, vrati se Nisi ti, ja sam kriv Možda naša veza nije luda kao što se čini možda se to dešava kada tornado se sretne sa vulkanom Samo znam da te volim previše i ne mogu otići Uđi, ponesi stvari Zar ne čuješ iskrenost u mom glasu kada pričam? Reko sam ti da sam ja kriv Gledaj me u oko Sljedeći put kad se naljutim Polupaću zid šakom Sljedeći put Sljedećeg puta nema Ispričavam se Mada znam da su samo laži Umoran od igara Želim je nazad Znam da sam lažljivac A ako ikad ponovo ode, Vezaću je za krevet I zapaliti ovu kuću   Samo ćeš stojati tu i gledati me kako gorim No nema veze, jer volim kako me boli Samo ćeš stojati tu i čuti me kako plačem No nema veze, jer volim kako me lažeš Volim kako lažeš Volim kako lažeš"

Where you going?”, “I'm leaving you.” “No, you ain't Come back!” We're runnin' right back, here we go again It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good it's goin' great I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snap, “Who's that dude?”, I don't even know his name I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie [Verse 2: Eminem] You ever love somebody so much You can barely breathe when you're with 'em? You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feelin' Yeah, them chills used to get 'em Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em? You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em So lost in the moments when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over, it controls you both So they say it's best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over But you promised her, next time you'd show restraint You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie [Verse 3: Eminem] Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines But your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me when it comes to love You're just as blinded, baby, please Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time! I apologize even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie"

Yeah....but you can't live on your past life success, the shadow, while some young names are calling u out and say they're will smack u in the face. So after a loud mouth stepped in the ring u knocked em out with no worry, now you're good in the media until another Jamal start barking, and so on they can bark how loud they can,-but u can either keep knocking out the young brm brm or bla bla or keep living with your earned name and money and go play golf and watch tv.

Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I can't tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight High off of love, drunk from her hate It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her, the more I suffer I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me And I love it, \"Wait Where you going?\" \"I'm leaving you\" \"No you ain't, come back\" We're running right back, here we go again It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad, it's awful I feel so ashamed, I snapped, \"Who's that dude?\" I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em? You meet, and neither one of you, even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah, them chills, used to get 'em Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face Spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over, it controls you both So they say you're best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday Yesterday is over, it's a different day Sound like broken records playin' over But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean Then we fall back into the same patterns Same routine, but your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded Baby, please come back, it wasn't you Baby, it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time I apologize, even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie"

Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I can't tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight High off of love, drunk from her hate It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her, the more I suffer I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me And I love it, \"Wait Where you going?\" \"I'm leaving you\" \"No you ain't, come back\" We're running right back, here we go again It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad, it's awful I feel so ashamed, I snapped, \"Who's that dude?\" I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em? You meet, and neither one of you, even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah, them chills, used to get 'em Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face Spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over, it controls you both So they say you're best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday Yesterday is over, it's a different day Sound like broken records playin' over But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean  Then we fall back into the same patterns Same routine, but your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded Baby, please come back, it wasn't you Baby, it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time I apologize, even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie"

Where you going?  \"I'm leaving you\"  No you ain't!  Come back  We're running right back  Here we go again  It's fucking gay  Cuz when it's going good it's going great  He's Superman with a dick in my ass  I'm Lois Lane  But when he ain't, he's awful  I feel so ashamed  I snapped  \"Who's that dude?\"  I don't even know his name  I laid my dick in him  I've never fucked so much again  I guess I chocked on his big dick  Just gonna stand there and rape my bum  Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts  Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  Well that's alright because I love the way you fuck  I love the way you fuck  I love the way you fuck  You ever sucked somebody so much  You could barely breathe when you eat em  My meat, and neither one of you even know what hit you  Got that warm glizzy feeling  Yeah, them dicks, used to get em  Now you're getting fucking horny looking at em  Now you're eating black dicks  Spewing jizz and semen and jizz when you spit em  They push, pull each other's dicks  Scratch, claw, bit em, throw em down, pin em  Suck cocks in the moment when you're in em  It's the gay that took over, it controls us both  So they say it's best to go and fucking gay  Guess that they don't know you  Cuz today, that was yesterday  Yesterday is over  It's a different day  Sounds like a sloppy penis shaking over  But you promised me  Next time you'll show restraint  You don't get another chance  Life is motherfucking gay  But you lied again  Now you get to slam your penis in the window  Guess that's why they call it window pain  Just gonna stand there and rape my bum  Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts  Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  Well that's alright because I love the way you fuck  I love the way you fuck  I love the way you fuck"

I'm leaving you No you ain't, come back We're running right back, here we go again It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad, it's awful I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude? I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face, Spewing venom in your words, when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over it controls you both So they say it's best, to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday Yesterday is over, it's a different day Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her Next time you'll show restraint You don't get another chance Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again Now you get to watch her leave Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded Baby please come back, it wasn't you Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall Next time, there will be no next time I apologize even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie"

People move on (its better to cut your losses short and leave.  fuck this shit is what I said).  Then when you are doing okay better on your own THEY get upset and want to hold you back.  I know this is screwed up.  THATS WHAT HAPPENED.  I tried to relate to race car driving or playing a game of football.  Fuck the team I play for I will get up and leave and clean out the locker and play for someone else.  It was the US Army and US Govt.  Im not with US Army anymore.  They gave all these other players on the team (US Army) benefit of the doubt over me and didnt bother me cus I knew they were all pieces of fucking shit and pussies.  Im not with that team (US Army) anymore I play for US Govt. now.  The legal part got out of control.  People move on.  After going through this I got recognized by other teams being able to do this.  The new team Im with knows where Im at with performance/stamina.  The only reason why my last team (US Army) made it that far is cus of me and the other teams know it."

Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie [Verse 1: Eminem] I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight High off her love, drunk from her hate It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — \"Wait! Where you going?\" — \"I'm leaving you!\" — \"No, you ain't! Come back!\" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snapped, \"Who's that dude?\", I don't even know his name I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie [Verse 2: Eminem] You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em? You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em? You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em So lost in the moments when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over, it controls you both So they say you're best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie [Verse 3: Eminem] Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time! I apologize, even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna— [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie"

I would absolutely like to see you on Rihanna’s next album whenever it may be and work with lil durk and drake too), hope everything is going well and if you want to make a song with me, it would mean the whole world that this can happen for  me, peace and happiness is coming quick again from one of ur biggest fans out there and maybe can one day be chill friends - Joaquin Nuñez"

Where you going?\" \"I'm leaving you\" \"No, you ain't, come back\" We're running right back, here we go again It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad, it's awful I feel so ashamed, I snapped, \"Who's that dude?\" I don't even know his name I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?

Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine But your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded Baby, please come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away, though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall \"Next time? There will be no next time\" I apologize, even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fucking leave again I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie"

Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I can't tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight High off of love, drunk from her hate It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her, the more I suffer I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me And I love it, \"Wait Where you going?\" \"I'm leaving you\" \"No you ain't, come back\" We're running right back, here we go again It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad, it's awful I feel so ashamed, I snapped, \"Who's that dude?\" I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em? You meet, and neither one of you, even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah, them chills, used to get 'em Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face Spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over, it controls you both So they say you're best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday Yesterday is over, it's a different day Sound like broken records playin' over But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean Then we fall back into the same patterns Same routine, but your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded Baby, please come back, it wasn't you Baby, it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time I apologize, even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie"

Rihanna) Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I can't tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like And right now, it's a steel knife in my windpipe I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight High off her love, drunk from her hate It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me She fucking hates me and I love it \"Wait! Where you going?\" \"I'm leaving you!\" \"No you ain't. Come back\" We're running right back Here we go again It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snap \"Who's that dude?\" \"I don't even know his name\" I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling Yeah, them chills used to get 'em Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em You swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em So lost in the moments when you're in them It's the rage that took over It controls you both So they say it's best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday Yesterday is over, it's a different day Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her Next time you'd show restraint You don't get another chance Life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines But your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me When it comes to love you're just as blinded Baby, please come back It wasn't you, baby it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk Told you this is my fault Look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time! I apologize even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games I just want her back I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again I'mma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire I'm just gonna Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie"

Début 2011 , ,C'était la cérémonie des Grammy Award et Eminem avait remporté Meilleur Album Rap de l'année 2010 pour Recovery ( Grosse compétition cette année ou Drake et Jay Z, était également nommé dans cette catégorie) . Il entre dans l'histoire à ce moment en étant le premier rappeur à remporté cette catégorie 5 fois ( il avait  eu le prix de l'album Rap de l'année pour  SSLP . MMLP.  TES . Et Relapse avant ça et il l'aura une sixième fois en 2013 pour MMLP 2 Mais il ne s'était pas déplacé) Son Grammy lui est remis des mains de Nicki minaj  et Will i am et Durant son discours   Il dira  \"Okay . C'est un record de fou . Je veux juste remercier tout ce qui ont travaillé sur l'album.  Les producteurs et toute la team à jouer un rôle cruciale dans cette Prise de risque que j'ai tenté.  Je veux remercier Rihanna aussi d'avoir aidé l'album à battre des records avec notre duo et d'avoir contribué au succès du projet.  Bien sûr  Dr dre comme toujours ici présent.  Jimmy également.  Toute la famille a Shady et à Aftermath. Et évidemment merci aux fans .  Detroit Représente \" .  Mais la soirée n'était pas finie.  Des grosses pointure comme Dre et Rihanna s'était  déplacé pour soutenir Em dans la catégorie  la plus prestigieuse \"Album de l'année \" Tout style  Musical confondu.  Eminem était le grand favori et avait l'occasion de marquer l'histoire en devenant le premier  artiste solo  Rap à remporté le prix le plus ce prix  ( La seule fois où le rap a remporté album de l'année  c'était avec le Groupe Outkast ) .  Tout était  fait  pour  préparer  une potentiel  victoire  Em aura même la plus longue Performance  sur scène de la soirée  ou il fera Il me semble  Not afraid  les deux  LTWYL avec Rihanna  et I need a doctor avec  Dre  . Eminem avait eu une année 2010 stratosphérique niveau  impact et il était aussi  en tête dans les nomination du soir.  Mais malheureusement il terminera 2ème derrière Le groupe canadien  The Subburds et leur album Arcade Fire élu album de l'année .  Eminem n'est plus jamais revenu au Grammy depuis cette décision malgré sa victoire en 2013 pour album Rap de l'année.   Il a ensuite expliqué en 2018 chez Sway que tant que les artistes Rap ne seront pas mieux mise en valeur  et que le système de vote ne sera pas plus respectueux en vers le   Hip hop il n'y retournera pas .  Cette année  Il est nominer pour l'édition 2025 dans quelques semaines ou il est en liste pour meilleur  album Rap de l'année 2024 . Sa première  nomination  en plus  de 10 ans Intéressant de voir si il fera son retour . ( même si je pense qu'ils vont le donner à Futur pour le son Like that sur son album    qui a démarrer la bataille Kendrick Drake avec  un verse de dingue de Kendrick   )"

Wait! Where you going? I'm leaving you No you ain't. Come back we're running right back. Here we go again It's so insane cus when its going good its going great. I'm superman with the wind at his back Shes Louis Lane but when its bad its awful, I feel so ashamed I snap Who's that dude? I don't even know his name I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength [Chorus] [Eminem] You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe When you're with 'em You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling Yeah, them those chills you used to get 'em Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at him You swore you'd never hit him; never do nothing to hurt him Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit him Throw him down pin him So lost in the moments when you're in them It's a race that's the culprit controls your boat So they say you're best to go your separate ways Guess if they don't know you cus today that was yesterday Yesterday is over it's a different day Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her Next time you show restraint You don't get another chance Life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window I guess that's why they call it window pane [Chorus] [Eminem] Now I know he said things hit things that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns same routine But your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me But when it comes to love you're just as blinded Baby, please come back It wasn't you, baby it was me Maybe our relationship wasn't as crazy as it seemed Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk I told you this is my fault Look me in the eye ball Next time I'm pissed, I lay my fist at the drywall Next time. There won't be no next time I apologize even though I know its lies I'm tired of the games I just want her back I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire"

Rihanna) [Rihanna:] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie [Eminem:] I can't tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like And right now, it's a steel knife in my windpipe I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight High off her love, drunk from her hate It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me She fucking hates me and I love it \"Wait! Where you going?\" \"I'm leaving you!\" \"No you ain't. Come back\" We're running right back Here we go again It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snap \"Who's that dude?\" \"I don't even know his name\" I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength [Rihanna:] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie [Eminem:] You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling Yeah, them chills used to get 'em Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em You swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em So lost in the moments when you're in them It's the rage that took over It controls you both So they say it's best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday Yesterday is over, it's a different day Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her Next time you'd show restraint You don't get another chance Life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane [Rihanna:] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie [Eminem:] Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines But your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me When it comes to love you're just as blinded Baby, please come back It wasn't you, baby it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk Told you this is my fault Look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time! I apologize even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games I just want her back I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again I'mma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire I'm just gonna [Rihanna:] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie"

Where you going? I'm leaving you No you ain't, come back We're running right back, here we go again It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snapped: Who's that dude? I don't even know his name I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie You ever loved somebody so much You can barely breathe when you're with 'em? You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feelin' Yeah, them chills used to get 'em Now you're gettin' fucking sick of looking at 'em? You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit them Throw 'em down, pin 'em So lost in the moments when you're in them It's the rage that took over, it controls you both So they say it's best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'Cause today, that was yesterday Yesterday is over, it's a different day Sound like broken records playing over But you promised her Next time you'd show restraint You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine But your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me When it comes to love, you're just as blinded Baby, please, come back It wasn't you, baby, it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside Pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There will be no next time! I apologize even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie"

I've been in two relationships like that. One violent one not, but the latter actually did more damage.  When I was in my very abusive relationship, it wasn't love that kept us there, but but obsessive, possessive co-dependant, feelings. It was like we were two of a kind, and we just fit. It felt like we belonged together in a fucked up kind of way.  The second time, it wasn't abusive, but it was crazy, deep, mad, love.... we hurt each other, but everytime either of us tried to leave, one of us would always stop the other from moving on, and each time, we'd get back together vowing to make it better, but it never was.  So many times, we knew it had to end for the sake of sanity, more than anything else....but everytime it seemed over, it wasn't and we'd just fall back into the same pattern, time after time.  Even my friends used to say \"It's never going to end. Ever\" and it felt like that for while.  After a while though, you become exhausted by it, and you accept that things are never going to change. It's heartbreaking, but such a relief at the same time.  I don't regret either of those relationships. The first because it gave me my little girl, and the second because, despite everything, he was, and is the best guy I've met, and I loved him, probably like I'll never love anyone, in a romantic sense,  again.  There is something in this song for every relationship. Some part(s) , or all, will always strike a cord for someone."

God Himself will be with them and be their God. 4 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.” 5 Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”❤️ 6 And He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. 7 He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. 8 But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone,🔥which is the second death.

You meet, and neither one of you, even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah, them chills, used to get 'em Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face Spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over, it controls you both So they say you're best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday Yesterday is over, it's a different day Sound like broken records playin' over But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean  Then we fall back into the same patterns Same routine, but your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded Baby, please come back, it wasn't you Baby, it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time I apologize, even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Traduci in italiano"

      "text": "I want to prefice this comment by saying that I respect people's opinions.  I, as an atheist, love how Christians believe in God and Jesus, Heaven, Hell and so on but blindly ignore scientifically proven phenomena, such as the Big Bang and evolution. I find that even one of the greatest flaws in Christianity is stupidly obvious. Apparently, gambling is a sin but the fact that Christians base their lives on the probability that there are Heaven and Hell is hilariously hypocritical.  Next. Is there any proof whatsoever about anything stated in the Bible? Is there proof of an actual miracle? As someone with a great imagination, I keep an open mind to the possibility of magic. But. If it is so stupidly improbable, that it is not possible to be explained by science, then fine. Miracles may exist.  What  is wrong with listening to science, though? I understand that religion runs deep in a person's DNA but some things simply are simply not possible. They may be called miracles but to me, the are simply things born from the lack of understanding of the situation. As an example, let's take a human's survival after a very early birth. Is it easier to believe that God saved them or the doctors? God, naturally. But once again, the skills of the doctors are overshadowed by the \"miracle\" that God created. Because it is simpler to believe, even if it is stupidly obvious what really happened. Next, we have the stories in the Bible Take Noah's arc, for example. Are we expected to believe a human filled up a huge boat with 2 of each animal? What did they feed the lions? The tigers? Zebras? Even the most hardcore Christian has to agree that that is a bit too much to believe. Once again, I want to state that I respect people's beliefs and in no way wish to offend anybody. If you are interested in having a sensible conversation about anything I've said so far, have at it, but if you only want to scream: \"Sinner!!!\", \" Burn in hell!!\", \"ATHEIST!!!\", please go do it on Sunday in church, where people would listen."

Cömert ve şefkatli olmasıyla dikkat çeken bu peygamber, ibadetlerine de oldukça bağlıydı. Nuh tufanı sonrasında putperestlik yapmaya başlayan ilk kavim Ad kavmi olmuştur. Bu sebeple de Hz. Hud kavmin bu sapkınlığı bırakması için peygamber olarak gönderilmiştir.  Hz. Hud, peygamberliği boyunca Ad kavmini Allah’a iman etmeye çalışmıştır. İlahı ikazları kavmine iletmiş ve bu yolda bazı mucizeler göstermiştir. Ancak Ad kavmi, her fırsatta Hz. Hud’u dinlemeyi reddetmiştir. İrem Bağları adı verilen bereketli topraklarda yaşayan bu kavim, ellerindeki bolluğa güvenerek kibre düşmüştür. Bu kibrin karşılığı olarak da Allah, onlara önce büyük bir kuraklık göndermiştir. Bundan sonra gelen kasırga ile de Ad kavmi tamamen yok olmuştur."

We are currently researching and discovering a lot of things. Let's think about a God, sir. That's how it can be. There is a Creator of all things. Which has no equivalent. Everything we see is His creation. Maybe some scientists don't believe in God. They say what we don't see.Why would we believe that. I want to tell them politely. Current science believes that they could not discover 1% of this universe. And they could not discover 99%. And NASA scientists believe that this 99% is not discovery and science. So tell me, sir, we have not yet discovered 1% of God's creation. So how do we discover God? And not being able to discover God does not prove that there is no God. Because science believes we cannot discover much of the world.And they say it's a science. You can tell now. So where is God? Sir, almost all the major religious texts of the world say that God is above all creation. He is not dependent on cars. Everyone is dependent on God. Simply put, there is a God above this world. Let's read our religious texts, sir. All those religious texts speak of one God.And God did not give birth to anyone, nor did anyone give birth to him. Because he is completely different from creation. There is nothing in the world like him. And Jesus was not God or the Son of God. And he never claimed to be the Son of God. And is the Qur'an. Sir, I can say with a challenge. There is nothing unscientific in the Qur'an and there is nothing inconsistent with science. Sir, according to UNSCO data, the religion of world peace is Islam.The word Islam means to believe in one God. These are my opinions. And everyone has the right to express an opinion. Sir, if I have said anything wrong in this article, please forgive me. And give your opinion. Thank you sir*"

It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat Everybody wants to be my enemy Spare the sympathy Everybody wants to be My enemy Oh, the misery Everybody wants to be my enemy Spare the sympathy Everybody wants to be my enemy Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint, no way My enemy Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint"

Believer is my favourite song and the line \"dont you tell me what you think that i could be, im the one at the sail im the master of my sea\" keeps me alive. thanks for making the song :)"

Read the holy Quran don't hear about islam.. And this is some verses of it..In the name of allah,The Entirely merciful, the Especially merciful.^^   Say \"He is allah, (who is) one, Allah the eternal refuge,He neither begets nor is born. Nor is there to Him any equivalent^^.... ^^And whoever desires other than islam as religion - never will it be accepted from Him and He, in the hereafter, will be among the losers^^... And this book is the last and final revelation from allah.. And this book had revealed from 1400 years.. And this book is so matches with the science... I will show you just one proof matches the science..“.. Hypoxia   Lack of oxygen. At high altitude the oxygen concentration in the atmosphere decreases. When oxygen level drops the blood vessels in the lungs constrict: Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), also known as the Euler-Liljestrand mechanism, is a physiological phenomenon in which small pulmonary arteries constrict in the presence of alveolar hypoxia (low oxygen levels).  Wikipedia, Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction, 2019 The blood vessels in the lungs constrict when oxygen level drops. This was only known recently however this was portrayed in the Quran 1400 years before it was discovered. [Quran 6.125] Those whom Allah wants to guide, He opens their chests to Islam; And those whom He wants to leave astray, He makes their chests tight and constricted, as if they are ascending to the sky: Such is the penalty of Allah on those who refuse to believe. \"He makes their chests tight and constricted, as if they are ascending to the sky\" today we know why it gets constricted, lack of oxygen. No mistakes in the Quran. How could an illiterate man who lived 1400 years ago have known what gets constricted at high altitude?.. .and if you want hundreds of mircles enter here:   The message is ended.. This message is to not say after your death i don't know the islam religion and i had followed the religion of my parents without thinking .and you should believe that Abraham, moses, jesus, mohammed and all the prophets are messengers of allah . O God i have delivered (the message), may you be my witness.. #islam is the religion of peace #spread this message One God One life One chance #there is no God but Allah, mohammed is god's massenger. ☝️ And if you don't believe me. this book will show you which is the real religion of God(Judaism, Christianity, or Islam in the light of  Science)"

Don't come without... Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer Pain Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain My life, my love, my drive, it came from... Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer Last things last By the grace of fire and flames You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh The blood in my veins, oh-ooh But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down It rained down, like... Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer Pain Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain My life, my love, my drive, it came from... Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer"

But you have to do certain things to not attract the ire or animosity of your foes . . . I think you can start by not trying to Shannon Sharpe your way through all the elementary and preschools first off, just in the first place. . . . It's strange visually. Stop being damn near almost 40 gunning for people HALF your age literally.  Dr6ke takes whatever age he sees on is birthday cake every year cuts it in half then says yup that's the age I'm going for now this year . . . . So we have to wait until Dr6ke is literally in the retirement home before he starts dating regular mature, full grown aged women, damm near over 70 years+ . . ."

I’m surprised he would decide to choose that route. It seems really grimy and racist. Not to mention, Kendrick also copies so many other artists styles to try to sound relevant. The difference is that Drake created his own style and other rappers tried to copy his flow. Kendrick showed everyone that he considered white people lesser than himself. I can’t even listen to his music anymore knowing this. Reminds me of when Lauren Hill said she gated white people and that they are devils. How is this any different? All he accomplished with this song was more division among different races."

In the beginning of this strong lyrics and dope beat song, Kendrick mentions he is yhe blueprint. Many considered Jay Z to be one of the 🐐 of rap, one of Jay ablum titles was 4:44. Need I say, Kendrick knows he's a GOAT at this. So much so he's on a level with other GOAT's!! So when you mention  Jay Z, Biggie, Pac and Wayne dont forget to mention Kendrick Lamars name!!! #PeriodT... I may have thought deep into it. 😅😅😅. But hey, I said what I said. Kendrick is GOAT level 🔥 💯   Update O.M.G if you click on the highlighted 4:44 numbers. It takes you to a certain part of the video. And its like a cherry on top how it lined up with my comment. 😅😅😅."

I haven’t heard any of Drake’s, and this is the only Kendrick one I’ve heard, but imo Kendrick has way better skill than this song in not just lyricism, but just in general.. I really would’ve expected a better song than this from him.  Two grown men with millions of dollars calling each other names like school kids is literally the lamest thing ever.  Starting a beef is stupid and responding is even worse.  Any respect I had for either is seriously reduced.  And ok, Kendrick seems to care about the safety of kids (awesome)… has he donated to something that protects kids from predators, or helped at risk children somehow, or is it just a funny punchline? Haven’t heard any songs from him mentioning how israel is a haven where peds go to escape the law… maybe he’s too scared to say things when there would be real life consequences to his career if he did 🤷🏼‍♂️"

We were deceived by a liar—the devil—and chose sin over obedience. Because God is holy, He cannot dwell with sin. So humanity was separated from Him. But God, in His great mercy, made a way to restore us. He sent His only Son—Jesus Christ (Yeshua, Jesus Cristo, Isa, Iesous, Yesu)—into the world. Jesus lived a perfect, sinless life and preached truth, love, and repentance. Then, He willingly gave Himself as a sacrifice for our sins. He was betrayed, beaten, whipped, mocked, and tortured. He carried a heavy wooden cross up a hill. Then, they nailed His hands and feet to that cross and left Him to die a brutal death. But when He died, something happened: He conquered sin and death once and for all. Three days later, Jesus rose from the grave. His tomb is empty—because He is alive. He ascended to Heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. And one day soon—He will return. Jesus will split the skies, riding on the clouds with power and glory, leading the armies of Heaven. He will judge the nations and every person who has ever lived. Justice will be done. But this is not just a warning—it’s an invitation. Call on the name of Jesus. Don’t take my word for it—cry out to Him yourself. Read the Bible. Ask Him if He’s real. He will answer. Time is short. The world is darkening. But there is light, there is hope, and there is salvation—in Jesus Christ alone. God bless you. You are deeply loved. Much love to all! If you have any questions or want to talk, just reply  yes, I’m a real person :)"
